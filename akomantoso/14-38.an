Ladies, if you could stand up. Also accompanying them is Bryan Duffy, who is a friend of mine and served as my official agent in the election - but that has nothing to do with this particular notice of motion. Please stand up, Bryan, and receive the warm welcome of the House. (Applause)</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Last night at their Spring Dinner, Halifax Chamber of Commerce President Francis Fares called for an all-Party task force to oversee implementation of the Ivany report. This was, of course, a recommendation of the Ivany report and we have some sense the task force is coming, so I would like to ask the Premier, when will the Premier be calling this group together?</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the Official Opposition has said, there will be some movement on this file, and I'm pleased to say that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Leader of the New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia have agreed to sit on a committee which will include members of the business community, members of academia, and members from all sectors across this province to ensure that we now move towards the implementation phase of the Ivany commission and, quite frankly, do what I believe was what all Nova Scotians want us to do, which is put aside partisan politics.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. The Ivany report has 19 goals to turn our economy around, to get our financial house in order, to encourage more Nova Scotians to move here and be part of our great province. I've asked the Premier previously to enact those goals in law, as is also a recommendation of the Ivany report, so that all of us in this House have a chance to vote on something positive together. Enshrining the Ivany goals in law would be another good step along with the creation of the task force, so I will ask the Premier on this last day, possibly, of this session, will he reconsider that other Ivany recommendation and agree to enshrine the Ivany goals in law?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I actually believe we've had something positive we could all vote on and it was called the budget, which focused on so many Nova Scotians. (Interruption) You have to appreciate the member for Cape Breton Centre. I do want to go back to the question though, if I may, and the reality of it is the spirit which the Ivany report was focused on was talking about providing opportunities for young people to stay in this province - our investment in research grants provides that, broadening the apprenticeship opportunity is allowing that to happen in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'm not taking credit for this line, but I do want to get it on the record: the budget certainly is the "Irony" report and not the Ivany report because far from doing what the Ivany report recommended, which was to get our financial house in order, the budget adds another $0.5 billion to our debt, doing the opposite of what Ivany recommended. It foresees another $1 billion over the life of this government when the Ivany report said to get our debt in line, and it finds new ways to send young graduates away from our province, the exact opposite. No wonder that the member for Cape Breton Centre has labelled it the "Irony" report when it comes to the budget.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. Today The Chronicle Herald is reporting that Nova Scotia will need to hire several thousand nurses over the next 10 years to avoid a nursing shortage. This was a message that nurses at Capital Health tried to tell the Premier just one month ago, when they went on strike in order to secure nurse-to-patient ratios that would improve patient safety.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : I want to, first of all, correct part of the question that came from the Leader of the New Democratic Party. We did not take away the right to strike, Mr. Speaker, from the health care workers. What we did is ensure that there is a level of essential services in this province so that Nova Scotia patients will know that there will be services in place that they can rely on. If there seems to be a labour disruption after that they can then take us on a strike, Mr. Speaker, unlike the former New Democratic Government who stripped away the right to strike from paramedics in this province.</p>

Mr. Speaker, it's kind of ironic coming from a Minister of Finance and from a government that continued to write blank cheques across this province. On October 8th, Nova Scotians took the blank chequebook away from that Party and we understand exactly why.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, the Bluenose II project is millions of dollars and two years overdue. In a recent South Shore Now news article, the member for Lunenburg said, "I have spent a great deal of time collecting information on the rebuild delays and cost overruns." She added, "It has taken a considerable amount of time to compile information, and is an ongoing piece of my constituency work."</p>

          <p>MS. MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, the iconic Bluenose II has been called a cathedral among sailing ships, yet sadly she is tied to the dock without usable steering equipment.

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. Earlier this week the Minister of Health and Wellness told reporters that his preference is to have one union representing all nurses in this province. The Minister of Health and Wellness went a little further saying he would prefer health care workers not vote on which union should represent them - no he wouldn't want to have that democratic right. What he would prefer is that government introduce legislation this Fall to decide which union represents each health care worker. I will table that story.</p>

The Minister of Health and Wellness has some odd ideas about labour relations. Taking away the right to choose which union represents you in the workplace is another one of these musings by the ne'er-do-well minister.

The system of these trucks is to redistribute about 1,200 kilograms when needed, so like when they are on a hill or in a slippery non-traction situation, they adjust their weight so that it's safer.

The department will be providing an update next week on this whole issue as we plan for the Fall, but I think getting back to a strong education program is critically important as well. It has been a combination of legislation and education that helped Nova Scotia reach the reduced about 10 per cent in our population over the last number of years.

Has the minister considered speaking with HRM about having their auditor examine the operations of Halifax Water to ensure that it is providing services at the least cost possible for the residents of HRM?</p>

          <p>MR. FUREY : Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. The administration of the Halifax Water Commission, as I indicated earlier, is the responsibility of HRM. At that municipal government level, I certainly have the utmost respect in their ability not only to be transparent but to bear in mind the concerns of homeowners and ratepayers.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. When Nova Scotia's first Mental Health and Addictions Strategy was tabled by the now Leader of the NDP, it was a hopeful day for people in our province. The strategy was developed by experts who stressed all of the recommendations were interconnected and in order for the strategy to be effective, all of the recommendations needed to be adopted as a package. I'd like to ask the minister, what is the minister's plan to ensure all of the Mental Health and Addiction Strategy recommendations are fully implemented and who will oversee this plan?</p>

LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, to the member for Sackville-Cobequid, mental health and mental health issues and the strategy, Together We Can, is a very valuable contribution to where we will go in the next number of years. We are now down to about five or six of those recommendations that will need to still be implemented and we know the department continues to make sure that all will be implemented as well as those that may be partially, to date, are being implemented. We do have some lead areas. Just yesterday we held the first national conference on peer support - again, another first for Nova Scotia in the mental health field.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, the issue of access to mental health support in communities for families continues to be a challenge. We have learned from past experiences that adding more clinicians doesn't address the issue of access. I'd like to ask, what is the minister's plan to improve access to psychiatric services for people across the province in the communities where they live?</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, we now have shorter wait-lists in many of the districts across the province for mental health, psychiatric services, and I'm pleased to say that our peer support program, our clinical follow-up has really seen significant improvement, and that's a journey that those who suffer from mental health have some major requirements. Often there is not a cure but if we can assist in recovery and have access in the community to those providers, then we have strengthened the mental health response in this province and we'll continue to go in that direction.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to hear that we are seeing those shorter wait-lists and that the work in previous years is paying off. Compassion fatigue is another serious challenge facing health care providers here in Nova Scotia and across the country. That includes nurses, doctors, paramedics, and especially mental health clinicians. I wonder if the minister could indicate, what steps is he taking to address compassion fatigue and ensure the well-being of the health care providers Nova Scotians depend on?</p>

The weather has been cold later in the season than usual, mechanic shops are backed up due to the weather, and one shop in my area didn't take its first snow tire off until late into April - it was actually the 17th or 18 of April. They're now booking a week in advance to get studded tires off cars. So my question is, what steps has the minister taken to ensure driver safety is a top priority?</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, this is a very important topic to the fishing industry in Nova Scotia. I think the problem we've had in the past is that we haven't really approached the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to find out exactly what science they need done. There are always new species in the mix, and we want to make sure that we do the right science to convince them that, yes, it's a good process to go through. We are now in the process of working with DFO to see if we can get that formula in place, because so many times when these things come forward, it's not clear exactly what DFO is looking for.</p>

          <p>HON. LABI KOUSOULIS : Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The member who just spoke with regard to 500 new FTEs, that number is inaccurate. It has been explained to him many times; he knows it's inaccurate and he does this to actually enrage Nova Scotians. In light of the Ivany commission, I would say that is not co-operative in the House and I'd like that statement retracted. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I am looking at the number of actual FTEs that it took to run the government last year. Through the budgeting process we have learned how many - just wait, it gets better, I think Nova Scotians will find this extremely interesting because I know I did. I look at the number of FTEs that it actually took to run the government last year and then through the budgeting process, I've learned how many this government estimates it will take to run the government this year. If you look at that actual number and compare it to their estimated number, you will see that they are estimating that they will need 550 new FTEs.</p>

I know everybody has other bills they want to get to as well, but it's a very important bill. The FMA is the sister bill to the budget, which we voted on about a week ago. It is also the plan for the coming year for the Province of Nova Scotia. It's how we're going to care for the needs and the programs that people rely on, how we're going to ensure that we have summer student programs.</p>

Then we had a second vote, and it was a four-four tie. The chairman voted, and I was thinking in my mind, what is going to happen? Are we going to see something special happen here? We didn't, because the chairman did vote, as really I expected, with his colleagues. But it was funny, for a few seconds there I was wondering, are we going to see something happen here?

As he pointed out, he raised a legitimate concern and we believe our process works best when we're able to speak freely and raise concerns and have government try to address them. I was pleased that our staff very quickly - even before I had the chance to get to the office, just in listening to the member for Sackville-Cobequid - were already drafting an amendment to address his concerns. I certainly want to thank my staff and staff at the Department of Justice who were quick to put an amendment together to address those concerns and I think that's a sign of when our democracy works well.</p>

I'm really appreciative of the fact that we have minimum standards, and I hope we'll have a maximum standard.
