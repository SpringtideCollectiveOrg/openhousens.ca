      <h1>About this site</h1>

      <p>OpenHouseNS helps you track what's said in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Important decisions are made in our legislature, and we want to make it easier for Nova Scotians to know what's happening.</p>
      <p>OpenHouseNS is <a href="https://github.com/opennorth/openhousens.ca">open source</a>. All debates are available as <a href="https://github.com/opennorth/openhousens.ca/tree/master/akoma_ntoso">open data</a> in the <a href="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</a> XML format.</p>
