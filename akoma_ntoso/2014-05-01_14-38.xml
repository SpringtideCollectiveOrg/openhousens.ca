            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Last night at their Spring Dinner, Halifax Chamber of Commerce President Francis Fares called for an all-Party task force to oversee implementation of the Ivany report. This was, of course, a recommendation of the Ivany report and we have some sense the task force is coming, so I would like to ask the Premier, when will the Premier be calling this group together?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the Official Opposition has said, there will be some movement on this file, and I'm pleased to say that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Leader of the New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia have agreed to sit on a committee which will include members of the business community, members of academia, and members from all sectors across this province to ensure that we now move towards the implementation phase of the Ivany commission and, quite frankly, do what I believe was what all Nova Scotians want us to do, which is put aside partisan politics.</p>

          <speech by="#jamie.baillie">
            <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. The Ivany report has 19 goals to turn our economy around, to get our financial house in order, to encourage more Nova Scotians to move here and be part of our great province. I've asked the Premier previously to enact those goals in law, as is also a recommendation of the Ivany report, so that all of us in this House have a chance to vote on something positive together. Enshrining the Ivany goals in law would be another good step along with the creation of the task force, so I will ask the Premier on this last day, possibly, of this session, will he reconsider that other Ivany recommendation and agree to enshrine the Ivany goals in law?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I actually believe we've had something positive we could all vote on and it was called the budget, which focused on so many Nova Scotians. (Interruption) You have to appreciate the member for Cape Breton Centre. I do want to go back to the question though, if I may, and the reality of it is the spirit which the Ivany report was focused on was talking about providing opportunities for young people to stay in this province - our investment in research grants provides that, broadening the apprenticeship opportunity is allowing that to happen in this province.</p>

I'm very proud of the fact that they've been able to show the people of this province that not only are we focused on today but we're focused well into the future. By the way, I'm very pleased that the members of the Ivany commission have been encouraged by the steps this government has taken.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm not taking credit for this line, but I do want to get it on the record: the budget certainly is the "Irony" report and not the Ivany report because far from doing what the Ivany report recommended, which was to get our financial house in order, the budget adds another $0.5 billion to our debt, doing the opposite of what Ivany recommended. It foresees another $1 billion over the life of this government when the Ivany report said to get our debt in line, and it finds new ways to send young graduates away from our province, the exact opposite. No wonder that the member for Cape Breton Centre has labelled it the "Irony" report when it comes to the budget.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm trying to be co-operative today, so I will ask the Premier, in my last question, this. It has been reported in his own address to the Halifax Chamber of Commerce that there would be two recommendations that the government would not be following through on; one is legislating the Ivany report in law - and I guess we know the answer to that - and the other is creating an all-Party committee to oversee progress. The Premier said at that time that he wouldn't be creating an all-Party committee. I'll table that.</p>
<p>I would just like to ask the Premier in light of that, and also the fact that he said in that same article that the place to work together is in the Legislature - well we see how that has been going recently. Apparently the Premier has changed his mind, which is a good thing in this case. I'd like to ask the Premier why has he changed his mind and now agreed to create an all-Party task force?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I've been encouraged by the support that I've been receiving from so many Nova Scotians about the direction this government has been going. I want to tell you that there are so many Nova Scotians who want to be part of continuing to move forward, generating a positive direction in moving this province forward.</p>
<p>I want to tell the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Leader of the New Democratic Party that I am very pleased with the fact that they have both agreed to be part of that committee. I'm looking forward to having it go forward, I'm looking forward to seeing some of the results, I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation with Nova Scotians because ultimately, Mr. Speaker, it will be Nova Scotians who will continue to drive the spirit of the Ivany report going forward and I'm looking forward to that.</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM. - NURSES STRIKE: LAW AMENDMENTS COMM. - RESPONSE</heading>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. Today <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> is reporting that Nova Scotia will need to hire several thousand nurses over the next 10 years to avoid a nursing shortage. This was a message that nurses at Capital Health tried to tell the Premier just one month ago, when they went on strike in order to secure nurse-to-patient ratios that would improve patient safety.</p>
<p>As we all know, Mr. Speaker, the Premier wasn't interested in listening to the nurses' legitimate concerns. Instead, he argued that Nova Scotia had more nurses for our population than the national average, saying, "The question becomes what more &#x2026; do you want? How much above the national average does Nova Scotia have to become before the union is satisfied?"</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question for the Premier is, when hundreds of Nova Scotians protested at Province House and spoke at Law Amendments Committee asking the Liberal Government to hire more nurses, why didn't the Premier listen?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I was following the lead of one of the former Health and Wellness Ministers under the former government, who did not implement the same policy that they are now advocating for in Opposition.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in spite of the statistics, the Health and Wellness Minister didn't seem too worried about the impending nursing shortage. He told <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> yesterday that he thinks "&#x2026; we'll be in great shape", and that's a direct quote.</p>
<p>But this isn't what young nurses are saying. They say the elimination of things like the Graduate Retention Rebate and the passage of Bill No. 37 are forcing them to look for work elsewhere. As one young nurse told CTV: I work in ICU and our manager is actually worried about an out-flux of people who are leaving at the moment, most of whom are young recent graduate nurses.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier is, how does taking away the collective bargaining rights of nurses and the elimination of programs like the Graduate Retention Rebate place Nova Scotia in "great shape" to attract and retain more nurses in the coming years?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>I want to, first of all, correct part of the question that came from the Leader of the New Democratic Party. We did not take away the right to strike, Mr. Speaker, from the health care workers. What we did is ensure that there is a level of essential services in this province so that Nova Scotia patients will know that there will be services in place that they can rely on. If there seems to be a labour disruption after that they can then take us on a strike, Mr. Speaker, unlike the former New Democratic Government who stripped away the right to strike from paramedics in this province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there is only one Party in this House who has taken away the right to strike from paramedics, and there is only one other Party in this province who wants to take it away from every health care worker. This Party has stood to ensure that we have essential services legislation in place while protecting workers' right to strike. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I further want to remind the Leader of the New Democratic Party that the Minister of Health and Wellness is continuing to work with Nova Scotians, continuing to provide great leadership on this file, continuing to make sure that we move away from an administrative-focused health care system to one that is focused on patients, and I'm very pleased to tell the member that we've now reached a number of 83 per cent of nurses who are working in this province staying in this province.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I believe those were statistics that were achieved under the previous government and the previous ministers, so I thank the Premier for the compliment.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the Liberal platform, the Premier makes a commitment to support nurses. I say it's pretty clear from nurses that, once again, the Liberals haven't delivered as advertised on another election promise.</p>
<p>My question for the Premier, why does he think threatening nurses with punishment, ignoring their concerns about patient safety, taking away their rights and the fair collective bargaining process, and throwing on top of them a massive tax increase is being supportive to young nurses?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, a tax increase? That's kind of ironic, considering it comes from the former Minister of Finance who raised the HST in this province. Mr. Speaker, it's kind of ironic coming from a Minister of Finance and from a government that continued to write blank cheques across this province. On October 8<sup>th</sup>, Nova Scotians took the blank chequebook away from that Party and we understand exactly why.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to remind this House that it was under the NDP that half a million dollars was taken out of the Nursing Strategy. This government is going to continue to work and ensure that Nova Scotian nurses stay and work in this province.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the <i>Bluenose II</i> project is millions of dollars and two years overdue. In a recent South Shore Now news article, the member for Lunenburg said, "I have spent a great deal of time collecting information on the rebuild delays and cost overruns." She added, "It has taken a considerable amount of time to compile information, and is an ongoing piece of my constituency work."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. Has the member for Lunenburg shared the information she collected about the overruns and delays with him, and has she shared the sources of this information with him?</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the iconic <i>Bluenose II</i> has been called a cathedral among sailing ships, yet sadly she is tied to the dock without usable steering equipment. The original contract provided a 43 per cent markup on materials and labour costs of $62 an hour during a regular shift and $93 an hour for overtime.</p>
<p>My question to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage, can he guarantee to the taxpayers of Nova Scotia that no markup costs or overtime labour will be added to the fixing of the failing rudder, and will he provide the taxpayers with a full and public update on the costs associated with fixing the rudder this Spring?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm going to continue on the same one for a few moments, if you don't mind. Today the government announced a test drive of the <i>Bluenose II</i> - do you think they were trying out an F 150 or, God forbid, try out a Lada. I mean are we going to get stuck with something that doesn't work at all?</p>
<p>The Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage (Interruptions) I know the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage doesn't remember the Ladas but they weren't much good, I can tell you. You were lucky if you had any heat.</p>
<p>The Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage said today, we have decided that we need to take <i>Bluenose II</i> on a test drive before sea trials - that's the first thing we've said. Yet on Thursday, April 17<sup>th</sup>, the same minister told this House twice, and I'll table the Hansard, that the <i>Bluenose II</i> was already under sea trials - that's number two. Mr. Speaker, if you want the quote, "As we've stated in the past, the vessel is currently under dock and sea trials."</p>
<p>The third thing the quote says, "What I am saying to you is that we're still going through those dock and sea trials." So how can the boat be in sea trials on April 17<sup>th</sup> and then today the minister announcing a pre-sea trial, or a test drive?</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will he please correct his answer to the House and if he didn't get the sea trials question right, what other answers should Nova Scotians question? Which one is right? Is it the first one? Is it the second one? Is it the third one? Just clarify what we're doing now.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#tony.ince">
            <from>MR. INCE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I will state to the member across the floor that first of all, being the minister who has received something that both the Parties across the floor began and we have to try to correct and fix all that was done prior? I would suggest to the member that he would look at what I said - I said it was in dock and sea trials, which accommodates to both the ship being there and being looked at. Everything that is being done currently is to correct any issues that we are addressing from past mistakes. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Let's line up one of your mistakes; the 2014 Doers and Dreamers Travel Guide has hit the shelves, ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately not everything in it is quite factual. On Page 81 of the guide - and I will table it - the province describes: a sail on the iconic Bluenose II - the Bluenose II in Lunenburg - breathe the salty air aboard the Nova Scotia world-famous sailing ambassador, Bluenose II, recently restored in the Lunenburg waterfront. I'll let you have that one, too, if you want to have a look at it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. As the lead on this project, does he think that it's okay to speak in the past tense and publicly declare that the boat has been recently restored?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#tony.ince">
            <from>MR. INCE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, I thank you for that question however, as the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage I have not made that statement that he is claiming was made. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, maybe the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism should take it up because it's in his document that he printed. (Interruption) Maybe I will, maybe I will.</p>
<p>I don't know about you Mr. Speaker, but I think it may be premature for people to invite people to breathe salty air on a boat with failing steering equipment. The solid steel rudder weighing several tons is just the latest problem in a long line of delays and cost overruns. The shipbuilders are now speaking out against the original rudder design. Taxpayers are already on the hook for $110,000 for the rudder, and some estimates say that the cost could climb to over $500,000.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, what is the new rudder going to cost and how long is it going to take before people can breathe the salty air aboard the <i>Bluenose II</i>?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#frank.corbett"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. Earlier this week the Minister of Health and Wellness told reporters that his preference is to have one union representing all nurses in this province. The Minister of Health and Wellness went a little further saying he would prefer health care workers not vote on which union should represent them - no he wouldn't want to have that democratic right. What he would prefer is that government introduce legislation this Fall to decide which union represents each health care worker. I will table that story.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#frank.corbett"><from>MR. CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, they're not only rudderless on the <i>Bluenose II</i> but they're rudderless on the labour issues. The Minister of Health and Wellness has some odd ideas about labour relations. Taking away the right to choose which union represents you in the workplace is another one of these musings by the ne'er-do-well minister. What this does is it really destabilizes the workforce within the health care system.</p>
<p>I want to ask the minister once again, through you Mr. Speaker. If the minister shares the views of the Minister of Health and Wellness and should they decide which union should represent which health care workers at the bargaining table, then when will these public consultations begin?</p></speech>

<p>Now look, Mr. Speaker, these are not things that this caucus is saying. We've tabled the musings, if you will, of the minister and it's not like someone on the backbench had said this.

          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Regulation for weighing the 3,800 pound Volvo air suspension truck has become quite an issue in Nova Scotia. These new trucks allow for significantly lower impact on fuel consumption; the Volvo air truck actually gets 9.5 miles per gallon while a regular fleet truck would only get 8.2.</p>
<p>Up to approximately $16,000 a year is in the savings cost for gas, and obviously leaving a lesser carbon footprint as well. The problem is that when these trucks go into the weighing stations, they are not weighed properly because of the distribution of weight. I'm wondering if the minister will explain what the delay is in moving forward with making changes to accommodate these new environmentally-friendly trucks.</p></speech>

It seems like something that is an administrative fix and something that's certainly causing significant headaches to small businesses that the member opposite represents, so I'll give the member my word that I'll check on that immediately and see if we can find updates. I'd be happy to report to her office with the findings.</p>

          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. According to some contacts that we've had within your department, there has been a briefing on this issue in the month of January. Also, over a month ago, the owner of King Freight Lines, Roland MacDonald, had a conference that he attended with a member, I believe from the department as well, Mike Balsom.</p>
<p>Mr. Balsom indicated that he would be getting a hold of Mr. MacDonald in the near future to discuss that changes that would be taking place. He still has not received any contact from Mr. Balsom. I'm wondering if the minister himself would follow up by calling Mr. MacDonald to provide him with an update, maybe in the next week or two.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for that. I know Mr. MacDonald will really appreciate that. The system of these trucks is to redistribute about 1,200 kilograms when needed, so like when they are on a hill or in a slippery non-traction situation, they adjust their weight so that it's safer. So it's obviously making our roads safer as well. As I mentioned, they are more efficient and literally will save thousands of dollars every year.</p>
<p>King Freight in Pictou West employs over 100 people, and they have 80 trucks on the road. They will probably have to lay off people due to the recent Michelin situation, which is very unfortunate. Just yesterday, once again, at Kelly Lake weighing station where he finds he is fined most often, he was fined again yesterday.</p>
<p>King Freight has no problem in New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, or travelling into the United States. The fine yesterday was close to $300. What I'm hoping is that, where he pays taxes and he lives here and he wants to keep his businesses here in Nova Scotia, the minister will please make this unfortunate situation a top priority and will have an opportunity to discuss it with Mr. MacDonald and, more importantly, so that Mr. MacDonald can keep his trucks on the road &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>This issue with this particular piece of the fleet for our Nova Scotia trucking industry, so I certainly - we're going to endeavour to get up to speed on those. If there's any advantage we can give to the private sector, Mr. Speaker, we'll take every opportunity to do that. We're certainly going to move in that direction as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>Again, specific to this file, I'd be happy to speak with the gentleman and see what we can do. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <heading>HEALTH &amp; WELLNESS: TOBACCO-FREE N.S. STRATEGY (2011) - UPDATE</heading>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. In 2000, Nova Scotia had 30 per cent of its population who smoked. Over the past 14 years that number has declined to 20 per cent, but has recently plateaued. This means we have work to do.</p>
<p>In 2011 the government released a revised Tobacco-Free Nova Scotia strategy with realistic targets that will benefit all Nova Scotians, including decreased tobacco use for all age categories, more public awareness, and more community action.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the minister, when will the minister update Nova Scotians on the progress of the latest Tobacco-Free Nova Scotia strategy that was released in 2011?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, he raises a very, very important public health issue. We have made great strides in Nova Scotia in reducing smoking through the Tobacco Access Act and also the Smoke-free Places Act. We are now, of course, taking a look at possible legislation for the coming Fall around working to make even further reductions.</p>
<p>I know that releasing where we are in relation to the strategy and what needs to be done will be part of our early Fall plan.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, evidence from the Canadian Cancer Society shows that Nova Scotians, in particular our youth, are facing another fight with tobacco companies with the distribution of flavoured tobacco products like cigarillos and flavoured water-pipe tobacco; 49 per cent of Atlantic Canadian high school youth have used tobacco in the last 30 days, and have also used flavoured tobacco, which is concerning.</p>
<p>Our Nova Scotia youth are still 6 per cent above the national average for those reporting having smoked a cigarette in the last 30 days and 5 per cent above the national average for those having smoked menthol cigarettes. I'm wondering if the minister could be specific on the actions he has taken to reduce these numbers.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, he does point out an alarming trend toward flavoured tobacco, hookah, and the e-cigarette, this whole area. The department will be providing an update next week on this whole issue as we plan for the Fall, but I think getting back to a strong education program is critically important as well. It has been a combination of legislation and education that helped Nova Scotia reach the reduced about 10 per cent in our population over the last number of years. Flavoured tobacco is very much top of mind in the Department of Health and Wellness.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, although the federal government passed legislation in 2010 prohibiting use of certain products, the experts feel it doesn't go far enough and there are a number of loopholes in that legislation, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>In an article on December 5, 2013, in the New Glasgow News, the minister said that he hoped to have legislation in the Spring session of the Legislature. Well, Mr. Speaker, we know that the House is winding down and there is no legislation on the order paper, so I'd like to ask the minster through you, when will the minister commit to taking the advice of the experts and amend the legislation and close the loopholes that the experts have identified?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is exactly right. The provinces, in fact, have often taken the lead in terms of both the - whether it's legislation or whether it's waiting for Health Canada. Nova Scotia has been a leader in reducing the use of tobacco products, and now we are about to embark on making further improvement. In the Fall we'll be prepared to bring legislation forward.</p>

          <heading>SNS - HFX. WATER DITCH TAX: BARRETT LUMBER - COMMUNICATION</heading>
          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations - I believe the department name has changed, they keep changing so much. But the minister knows who he is, I know that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Halifax Water has imposed a new fee on residents living in suburban and rural areas. The ditch tax, as it has become known, has hundreds of residents upset. I know all members have received a letter from David Barrett, owner of Barrett Truss and Building Supplies in Beaver Bank. His business is facing an increase of $6,000 on the company's water bill next year. Mr. Barrett has written a letter, of course, to us all. My question is, has the minister had any communication with Mr. Barrett and other residents about the issue?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#mark.furey">
            <from>HON. MARK FUREY</from>
            <p>I acknowledge the question from my colleague in opposition. I too have the correspondence from Mr. Barrett and have been involved in some discussion around the fee charged by Halifax Water. The area of responsibility falls within Halifax Regional Municipality, and as we speak, we are permitting HRM officials to follow through with the process for which they're responsible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it certainly makes sense - I mean, it is a municipal issue - but at the same time, we know that people do contact us from time to time about issues related to other levels of government. I know members opposite certainly champion causes that may be related to the federal government sometimes. They even bring them forth here in the Legislature.</p>
<p>My question for the minster, given that many residents are dealing with the cost of the ditch tax, does the minister plan to keep his eye on this and to perhaps get involved if the response isn't to the liking of the people here in HRM?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#mark.furey">
            <from>MR. FUREY</from>
            <p>The circumstances that we're speaking to, obviously very conscious of the anxiety and concern that it's causing homeowners. As I indicated earlier, I'm privy not only to the correspondence of Mr. Barrett, but the concerns of a number of residents within HRM. I certainly will continue to monitor the process and stay abreast of this matter as it goes forward.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster">
            <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
            <p>My final question is a bit more specific. One of Mr. Barrett's requests surrounded the transparency in operating habits of the Halifax Water utility. I know, Mr. Speaker, here in the province when there is a matter like that, oftentimes we would have the Auditor General review the operations. Has the minister considered speaking with HRM about having their auditor examine the operations of Halifax Water to ensure that it is providing services at the least cost possible for the residents of HRM?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mark.furey"><from>MR. FUREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. The administration of the Halifax Water Commission, as I indicated earlier, is the responsibility of HRM. At that municipal government level, I certainly have the utmost respect in their ability not only to be transparent but to bear in mind the concerns of homeowners and ratepayers.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor the situation through the staff and contact with HRM staff where there's an excellent dialogue. We'll continue along those lines and certainly monitor as we go forward.</p></speech>

            <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. When Nova Scotia's first Mental Health and Addictions Strategy was tabled by the now Leader of the NDP, it was a hopeful day for people in our province. The strategy was developed by experts who stressed all of the recommendations were interconnected and in order for the strategy to be effective, all of the recommendations needed to be adopted as a package. I'd like to ask the minister, what is the minister's plan to ensure all of the Mental Health and Addiction Strategy recommendations are fully implemented and who will oversee this plan?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, to the member for Sackville-Cobequid, mental health and mental health issues and the strategy, <i>Together We Can</i>, is a very valuable contribution to where we will go in the next number of years. We are now down to about five or six of those recommendations that will need to still be implemented and we know the department continues to make sure that all will be implemented as well as those that may be partially, to date, are being implemented. We do have some lead areas. Just yesterday we held the first national conference on peer support - again, another first for Nova Scotia in the mental health field.</p>
<p>I can assure the member opposite that this is a very important issue and topic to our government. We will continue to implement the strategy as well as the recommendations of Dr. Jana Davidson for adolescent mental health.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson">
            <from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the issue of access to mental health support in communities for families continues to be a challenge. We have learned from past experiences that adding more clinicians doesn't address the issue of access. I'd like to ask, what is the minister's plan to improve access to psychiatric services for people across the province in the communities where they live?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we now have shorter wait-lists in many of the districts across the province for mental health, psychiatric services, and I'm pleased to say that our peer support program, our clinical follow-up has really seen significant improvement, and that's a journey that those who suffer from mental health have some major requirements. Often there is not a cure but if we can assist in recovery and have access in the community to those providers, then we have strengthened the mental health response in this province and we'll continue to go in that direction.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson">
            <from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to hear that we are seeing those shorter wait-lists and that the work in previous years is paying off. Compassion fatigue is another serious challenge facing health care providers here in Nova Scotia and across the country. That includes nurses, doctors, paramedics, and especially mental health clinicians. I wonder if the minister could indicate, what steps is he taking to address compassion fatigue and ensure the well-being of the health care providers Nova Scotians depend on?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the member opposite raises a very important question because sometimes the provider, the deliverer of mental health services also needs the kind of support and, I guess, a break from those kinds of demands.</p>
<p>One of the areas where I think we've made significant improvement upon is having a greater support system across the province. Our community health boards are working on a program, the mental health tool kit, or the mental health first aid, and that kind of help is actually reducing some of that burden that has been solely placed at one time on those who are our primary mental health clinicians.</p>
<p>I think as we move further in this direction, we'll have a stronger community-based support system that in fact will alleviate that extreme workload that many of our clinicians have traditionally had.</p></speech>

          <heading>TIR: BILL NO. 168 (2007) - ENACT</heading>
          <speech by="#margaret.miller"><from>MS. MARGARET MILLER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as this House knows, impaired driving legislation is very near and dear to me, especially since this May is the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of my son Bruce's death at the hands of an impaired driver.</p>
<p>In my former life as president of MADD Canada, I lobbied governments across Canada for better legislation, including one that asks drivers to have a zero blood alcohol content for the first five years of driving. There is no question that this is valuable legislation because it will save lives, because it keeps new drivers separated from alcohol for those first five years of driving.</p>
<p>In 2007 I was thrilled when the then Progressive Conservative Government of Nova Scotia introduced and passed Bill No. 168 that allowed this to happen. MADD Canada praised the government of the day for this measure with a national press release and, furthermore, awarded them a higher rating in a national document that rated all the provinces on their legislation.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Speaker, that's as far as the legislation got; it has never been enforced. When it came to that government, it was about getting the press, taking the credit, and not saving lives on our highways.</p>
<p>In 2009 we asked the new government of the day, the NDP Government, to enforce the 2007 legislation and, again, waited four years for it to happen. Again, road safety was not a priority.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question today to the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal is, will this government finally put the youth and safety of our motorists first and enforce Bill No. 168 from 2007?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you to the member for the question. It takes a lot of courage for her to stand in her place and ask questions of this nature. She is driven by the memory of her son, Bruce, and her time at MADD, and I know she wants to make meaningful changes in this province.</p>
<p>I was really surprised to learn when I asked the question, initially upon joining the department, why this wasn't proclaimed. There isn't really an answer and I'm surprised to know that things can pass through this Legislature and not actually come into law seven years later.</p>
<p>We are taking steps to enact that legislation; we're moving very quickly on that. We're working with our counterparts in Justice and Municipal Affairs to make that happen, Mr. Speaker. We will work on that legislation and we're aiming to have it in the Fall - not only some of the components that the member mentioned, we're going to reintroduce those and we're going to make even stiffer penalties and increase some of the impaired driving legislation that will strengthen our system.</p>
<p>It won't be this minister, Mr. Speaker, and it won't be this government, it will be that member who will drive those changes, as we're going to rely on her to lead the way, so we're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <heading>ENERGY - NSP ELECTRIC BILLS: CALCULATION - ACCURACY MECHANISM</heading>
          <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for his answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Energy. As people know, Nova Scotia Power is a monopoly - customers do not have a choice to go to another company should they be unhappy with their service. This is why it is important that there is an oversight of NSP as it ensures that they are providing quality service. This oversight is especially important to ensuring that the electricity bills sent to customers are accurate.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question to the minister is, can the minister provide details on whether or not there is a mechanism in place to ensure that Nova Scotia Power is accurately calculating the electric bills sent to its customers?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Thank you for the question. I think it's a good question, because over the years I've had a number of complaints from residents on this very issue. In fact, there is a mechanism in place. I don't want to stand here and say that it can't be improved, because I think it probably can be, but there is a mechanism through the Utility and Review Board; it's actually the identical process for municipal water bills that are regulated through the board.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a cumbersome process - I say that right up front - and it is one that I think begs looking at and potentially improving.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer and I think there are a few individuals who have contacted us who would thank him for that answer as well.</p>
<p>Mack Garland of Baddeck received his latest electricity bill and he noticed that something just wasn't right. His Efficiency Nova Scotia charge increased nearly 120 per cent from the bill prior, yet he used less electricity. I'll table those power bills.</p>
<p>He called Nova Scotia Power about it. They didn't give him an answer immediately but then later they admitted that it was an error and his bill will be adjusted. I've had several calls since then from other people in the area who had similar issues, with others reporting it and wondering what's going on.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, does the minister have an explanation as to how this could have happened? Is the onus on the ratepayer to ensure that NSP is accurately charging the individuals?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I guess there are a couple of issues there. First of all, I'm sure his constituent will be happy that the government is taking the efficiency charge off his bill so that will be one less charge that he has to watch. It's just too bad the Progressive Conservatives didn't vote in favour of taking that off as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of elements here. Mr. Speaker, in fairness, I actually think it's a serious issue because I think probably a lot of people actually look at their bill and don't pay as close attention to it. There are two issues. One, the meters are not always read. Sometimes they are estimated and there's actually a way - and I can't remember off the top of my head what it is - there's a mark on the bill that will tell you whether it's a month that it was estimated or whether it was actually read and they do true-ups. I can find out exactly what that mark is. I remember seeing it on my own bill.</p>
<p>Then there is also somebody at Nova Scotia Power who is designated to deal with those kinds of issues and have it come out and read again if there is an issue. I've also heard issues from some residents where there ended up actually being a faulty meter. Those are usually the three most common issues that can result in that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I don't think it's fair to the resident and I'm certainly happy to look at it. If they don't get resolution through the designated person at Nova Scotia Power, I know our office is very happy to make inquiries on that constituent's behalf as well.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Thank you, the minister's answer is very reasonable, I think. I guess the very fact that he used less power and is getting charged more tax on the efficiency thing is something that really would bother him.</p>
<p>You're right; I don't think a lot of people take a look at it maybe as closely as that. The amount charged per kilowatt hour for the Efficiency Nova Scotia program is not clearly listed on the bill and yes, that's going to be coming off at some point.</p>
<p>This inaccuracy on Mr. Garland's bill highlights the importance of reviewing bills as they come in and that's something that you should be talking to all our ratepayers about and our constituents. It's unfortunate that it seems that the onus is on the ratepayers to correct the mistakes of Nova Scotia Power. While I recognize that the government plans to hide the charge entirely, come next year, in the time being that rate should be clearly displayed until that happens.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, has the minister had any conversation with Nova Scotia Power about the transparency of its bills, including whether the Efficiency Nova Scotia calculation rate should be displayed? Anyone who is paying a bill to Nova Scotia Power or any other utility should know exactly what they are paying for and I wonder if the minister will make sure there is transparency in the bills they are paying.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm just reading the two bills very, very quickly, but my initial thing that I notice is that the first bill crosses a period of December 13 to February 14 and there was both an Efficiency Nova Scotia rate increase in that period, before the next bill, and there is also a Nova Scotia Power rate increase of three per cent.</p>
<p>That being said, of course, the member is correct that it goes from basically $6 to $12 for the Efficiency Nova Scotia charge. At the end of the day, he is absolutely correct there is a certain amount of onus that's on customers to look at their bills, whether it's Nova Scotia Power, Sobeys, or wherever else. But when these issues are found, they need to be brought, and I'm perfectly happy if they're brought to my attention or my department's attention because we will look into them.</p>
<p>One of the things that we've done with the new efficiency legislation, since the member asked about that, is that the charges that people pay are audited and published through the board and so forth annually. They will be completely transparent - not only transparent, but they will be audited by independent auditors in a manner that people will know not only what they're paying for that, but will know what they're playing for other fuel types as well. But I'm certainly happy to also look into this one specifically, thank you very much.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Today is the deadline to have studded tires off your vehicles. The weather has been cold later in the season than usual, mechanic shops are backed up due to the weather, and one shop in my area didn't take its first snow tire off until late into April - it was actually the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18 of April. They're now booking a week in advance to get studded tires off cars. So my question is, what steps has the minister taken to ensure driver safety is a top priority?</p>

I've got a little bit of good news, but I'll allow my colleague, who is so diligent on these issues, to answer the question. So I'd like to turn it over to the Minister of Municipal Affairs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#mark.furey"><from>HON. MARK FUREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. Just this Saturday I was in and hard my tires rotated and spoke to the staff. They shared the very same concerns that the member has shared today, acknowledging that the weather itself, the period of winter was extended longer than normal - God knows - and the backup that this has created in those service centres for these tire rotations or tire exchanges.</p>
<p>What I will share with the member opposite, Mr. Speaker, is I've reached out to staff already specific to this issue, cognisant of today's date and those pressures that not only vehicle owners are facing but pressures that service centres are facing, and certainly prepared to extend the date until the first of June to facilitate these circumstances.</p>
<p>There are a couple of necessary steps, both regulatory and through my colleague in the Department of Justice, appropriate to correspond with the law enforcement community to ensure that in the short term, vehicle operators aren't impacted by enforcement. So those are the steps that we're prepared to take.</p></speech>

In the fishing industry, now more than ever, there is a need for innovation and cooperation. Several fishers applied to Ottawa to gain access to undeveloped species such as green crab, hagfish, quahogs, and Irish moss.</p>
<p>These applications were denied, Mr. Speaker, due to the lack of scientific research. Last year, Nova Scotia was willing to partner with Ottawa to help fund this research. My question to the minister is, can the minister give us an update on any progress made on behalf of fishers to fund the research and give them access to undeveloped species?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell"><from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this is a very important topic to the fishing industry in Nova Scotia. I think the problem we've had in the past is that we haven't really approached the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to find out exactly what science they need done. There are always new species in the mix, and we want to make sure that we do the right science to convince them that, yes, it's a good process to go through. We are now in the process of working with DFO to see if we can get that formula in place, because so many times when these things come forward, it's not clear exactly what DFO is looking for.</p>
<p>We're going to try to find out exactly what they're looking for so that we can provide the valuable information that they need to ensure that we can get these species open, help the economy in Nova Scotia, and help the long-term viability of the fishing industry as we move forward.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#sterling.belliveau"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the fishing industry employs thousands of Nova Scotians, many of whom are seasonal employees. Providing harvesters with access to undeveloped species will help the industry diversify and supplement their incomes, which are already under attack with the federal employment insurance reform.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, what action is this Liberal Government taking to limit the impact of these employment insurance reforms and protect the livelihood of people and the fishing industry in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we're very deeply concerned about that change in employment insurance, and it's unfortunate the Conservative Government in Ottawa has made this change. As a result of that, there's going to be some hardships in the communities, and not only in direct harvesting. It's also in the processing, where they're going to lose the workers &#x2026;</p>

          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move third reading of Bill No. 64.</p>
<p>I have only a few comments to make today about the Financial Measures (2014) Bill. We were commenting just earlier about what a very small bill it is. Usually governments put an awful lot of things into the Financial Measures Bills, and it can become a really big omnibus bill. We have been able to enact the legislative requirements for the budget in this Financial Measures (2014) Bill with just two major clauses in it.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of debate here in the House, and perhaps we'll hear a bit more on this third reading, but we feel that the budget as it stood was very well done, and that these two pieces, particularly looking at the HST and the Graduate Retention Rebate, were both very well thought out, well evidenced, and done for the right reasons.</p>
<p>I would like to just mention that we are very well aware of the comments made at the Law Amendments Committee, and we particularly appreciate the fact that our province has that opportunity, which is not afforded everywhere in the country, that there be an opportunity to hear from people who believe there should be amendments to any bill that passes through the House. The emphasis in what we heard at Law Amendments Committee really stressed the go-forward in terms of what changes could be made to support young people both trying to get forward and get their first job and move forward in our province, but also to help people in university with access to university, with the affordability of university and colleges, so we can help young people get the training they need to be successful.</p>
<p>I think it's very important to note that the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education has already begun those discussions, and had in fact begun them since coming to office. We are continuing them. They will be productive, I'm sure, and we have many ideas that people are presenting to us.</p>
<p>With those few comments, I look forward to hearing from the members of the Opposition.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just for a moment want to start by congratulating the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board on her first budget and bringing it to this point where it will inevitably be passed into law this afternoon. I know it's an accomplishment to take note of, and I'm sure all members feel the same way.</p>
<p>Having said that, we've had a lot of debate in the last few days, particularly in Question Period, about the importance of the Ivany report and putting its goals into law. I know all Parties say that they want to see the Ivany report recommendations and goals acted upon. One of those goals - a very important one that I believe all Nova Scotians share - is that we return to a time of appropriate balanced financial management here at the level of the provincial government.</p>
<p>The Ivany report specifically sets a goal of decreasing Nova Scotia's net debt to the size of its economy. The government may think that somehow this budget is consistent with the Ivany report, but the facts are quite the contrary. We know already that the government has presented to this House a budget that has a deficit of $279 million. If you remove the one-time items out of last year's budget that the NDP did, that's actually a worse result than even the NDP had in their last budget, and all Nova Scotians certainly had a lot to say about the way the NDP managed the finances of the province. I can imagine how disappointed they're going to be to see that the Liberals, in their first budget, after saying they would be better financial managers, actually brought in a worse bottom line that resulted in a $279 million deficit. They're spending that much more money than they're going to take in - worse than the NDP.</p>
<p>In fact, where the Ivany report says let's get our debt under control, in this one year the Liberals are going to add $500 million to our already too-high provincial debt and project - using their own numbers - that they will add $1 billion over the life of their government. The Ivany report was very clear, and Nova Scotians have been very clear - we all know in our heads and our hearts that we can't go on like this. With a new government and supposedly new hope that things would get better, they're about to get a lot worse, and this budget paves the way.</p>
<p>Many people say you have to compare your debt to the size of the economy, and that's true, but we also know the economy has flat-lined. It had less than 1 per cent growth last year, 0.3 per cent the year before, so there is no way that the government can say they're taking some initial steps toward implementing the Ivany goal and financial responsibility when we have a flat economy and a debt that is going to go up by $500 million in one year, and $1 billion overall. Clearly we're going in the wrong direction, Mr. Speaker. When the government says they're trying on Ivany, Nova Scotians have to question their competence when it's so clear that they're running in other direction from Mr. Ivany and his report.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the main issue today in this province is jobs and the economy. Where are families going to find a place to work? Where are young people going to find a place to work when they get out of school? Where are people that live in our rural communities in particular, who rely on resource industries, going to find the jobs of the future? There is no plan for jobs in this budget, none.</p>
<p>The Premier says you can't legislate prosperity. Well you know what, Mr. Speaker? With this budget we've learned something: you can legislate stagnation. Because when you drive our taxes up to the highest in the country, when you drive our debt up to record levels, when you impose a gigantic tax increase on the backs of our young graduates, you are legislating the opposite of prosperity. That's what this budget does and that's why it's getting a thumbs down by us and by other Nova Scotians who are still hopeful that someday there will be a government that is competent enough to get our finances under control and get the conditions right to create jobs.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Speaker, the great irony is that the only jobs that are going to be created as a result of this budget are in the Public Service, government jobs. As much as we appreciate people that work for the government, it flies in the face of the statements of the government and of others that I agree with, that is that the government can't create jobs - that our employers large and small, they are the ones that we have to turn to for job creation. But there is nothing for them, and so there is no plan to create real sustainable private sector jobs in companies large and small. There are only 551 new government jobs - or 100, depending on how you count it over there at the Public Service Commission. But in any event, for all those Nova Scotians that were looking for some restraint, the government with a majority coming in, in its first year with a mandate to actually turn the finances around, there is no restraint to be found here. More government jobs are being created and funded with our tax dollars - another example of going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the very Nova Scotians that we are concerned about the most, the very Nova Scotians that the Ivany Report says that we have to find ways to keep them here - our young graduates out of our schools, our universities, our community colleges. The Ivany report says focus on them, and the government did focus on them, Mr. Speaker, but in the exact opposite way that the Ivany report says. Instead of finding ways to keep them here and give them a break so they can start to put down roots in our province, maybe pay off their student loan, save up the down payment for a house, do a proper search for that first job, the government eliminated the Graduate Retention Rebate and imposed on those very young graduates a 275 per cent tax increase.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that's not Ivany, that's the anti-Ivany. That's the problem with a government that just doesn't get it, that isn't competent enough to focus on what really matters, that actually looks at our young graduates, looks at the families today across the province that already are struggling at the end of the month, and finds new ways to tax them when we already had the highest taxes in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the government says, well, we can't give them a break. We can't give them a break because of the deficit. The budget's not balanced. Well that would be fine, except it's in their hands to balance the budget. You know, Mr. Speaker? For once, when someone says to one of us on the Opposition side, well what would you cut? We can say, look at the numbers. They don't even have to do a lot of cutting. If they just held the line on government spending, kept it the same as last year, don't add more, we would have had a surplus today that Nova Scotians could use for meaningful tax relief or meaningful debt relief, or a little of both. But instead they have neither, because government spending is going up over $400 million in this budget. That's why there is a deficit.</p>
<p>For all those Nova Scotians who are wondering why they can't get tax relief, it's not because the government inherited a problem, it's because they're spending their tax money at a whole new level. If they had just decided to keep it the same, we'd be in a much better place today, but they didn't do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what is particularly galling for all those Nova Scotia families that have to balance their own budget is where the government is spending its money. There aren't great new programs that we can complain about the cost of but recognize the benefit of; there aren't new initiatives that will make things better in the future. Some of the biggest percentage increases in this budget are at the head office level of the Departments of Education and Early Childhood Development, Health and Wellness, and so on, where they got double-digit increases while everybody else has to struggle to get by.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I heard that the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board said yesterday that people have to understand that it's really hard to balance the budget; it's really hard to be in government. Well do you know what's really hard - getting to the end of the month at home and trying to decide how you're going to pay the rent, and how you're going to pay your power bill, and how you're going to pay your property taxes, and how you're going to pay all that HST, and how you're going to make sure your kids get looked after. That's hard and there are hundreds of thousands of Nova Scotia families that face those decisions every month. They don't have 500 civil servants backing them up when they try and make it balance. They don't get to go and borrow $500 million to make it work. They don't get to decide to charge another tax to someone else - that's hard.</p>
<p>It is for them, Mr. Speaker, that we stand here and say, if Nova Scotians are being asked to make the hard decisions in their own family budget at the end of the month, then the least the government can do is show the way and be there, too.</p>
<p>But we don't have that - no plan for jobs, brand new levels of debt, brand new taxes. The fact of the matter is that all the problems the government truly did inherit - our debt, our tax levels, our power rates, the out-migration of young people, this budget actually addresses every single one by making them worse and that's the problem, Mr. Speaker. That's why we're voting "no".</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to have one last kick at the can on the Financial Measures (2014) Bill, the bill that accompanies the budget, the enabling legislation for that budget.</p>
<p>This bill, as we know, is a short bill and it only contains a couple of provisions. The most concerning provision to us is the reduction or the elimination of the Graduate Retention Rebate, which we've had a lot of discussion around. I think our position has been pretty clear with respect to that.</p>
<p>It is a provision that will be felt by many people who were relying on this particular rebate to help them reduce debt and cushion the high cost of living, especially when you are starting out, young people who are in that age group of 20 to 29, two-thirds of the recipients of the Graduate Retention Rebate were in that position.</p>
<p>This is a bill that will hurt the very people who we most need to feel an attachment to Nova Scotia and to stay here and contribute to our province. Of course the other part of this bill is to essentially absolve government of any responsibility to start to reduce the HST, which we all recognize is a means of taxation that will contribute to the government's revenue, at a time when government needs revenue.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Speaker, we do have to have an adult conversation about how to have a competitive tax regime in the Province of Nova Scotia. I'm afraid that this government and the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board have avoided that entirely. This measure they're taking today in the Financial Measures (2014) Bill looks as if they're not prepared anytime soon to have that conversation and to make the very tough decisions that need to be made - the tough decisions that the Minister of Finance used to lecture the previous administration and the previous Finance Ministers about all the time here, in lengthy, lengthy, lengthy debates on the Financial Measures Act.</p>
<p>I can recall quite a number of those debates when quite often it was the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board who was the only member on the Opposition side who spoke, and she never spoke briefly, I can assure you, Mr. Speaker. She spoke at length. She had quite a lot of critical comments to make about the direction of the province's finances.</p>
<p>Frankly, Mr. Speaker, there's no difference, there's no change here. This is essentially going in the same direction, by and large, with two differences. One of the differences is that spending in the various departments has not been disciplined, is something that, certainly, we worked very hard to have a very disciplined Public Service capable in budget years of meeting targets and living within their means. It appears that that is not a philosophy that this government subscribes to, and that has serious implications for our province on a go-forward.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we were promised - Nova Scotians were promised and they were led to believe there would be quite a number of benefits from having a Liberal Government. They were led to believe that electricity rates would be lower. They were led to believe that the cost of gasoline in the province would be lower. Students were led to believe that education would be more affordable and tuition would be lower. These aren't things that are imaginary. They are on the record repeatedly as members of the Opposition outside of government saying these things.</p>
<p>If you talk to the residents of the province, they will tell you that they got those messages loud and clear. And now people are feeling, well, who are these people? This isn't the behaviour that we expected based on the rhetoric we heard. Electricity rates aren't any lower. Gasoline costs are higher than they had been. The relief for students with respect to tuition, those things, they didn't expect a $50 million cut to the Graduate Retention Rebate.</p>
<p>The critique and the criticism around increasing the HST could only lead people in the province to think, well if you're that critical of it, then you must be going to do something about it. But apparently not. Apparently that was perhaps what was intended by being critical without going the extra mile and being specific and saying well, we're critical of it and we're going to do something about it, and this is what we're going to do.</p>
<p>I think it was quite clever that those comments were never actually made. It gave the government the out. But I can tell you that many, many Nova Scotians today are recognizing that this Liberal Government is not exactly as advertised, in a whole variety of areas. They simply are not as advertised.</p>
<p>The Financial Measures (2014) Bill is here before us. We've had extensive debate on this. We've had quite a number of presenters come to the Law Amendments Committee and our caucus will not be supporting this bill when it comes to a vote, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise today and speak to this bill. I'll keep my comments today to - we have to, as we're standing in this Chamber and we're making decisions on bills that come before us, we do have to be conscious of the Nova Scotians who will be impacted by the legislation that is passed here. The reality in this province is that families are struggling. Families have to make tough decisions every day as to what they can afford and what they can't afford.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's not easy to govern. I know there are a lot of tough decisions that are required in running a province. You know, when we think about the families and the tough decisions they are making, a cut in the HST puts money back into the pockets of those families that they can then spend to run their households. Sometimes it's money that could be necessary for groceries, and in some cases it's just the money for the extra niceties to provide for their family.</p>
<p>I talked to a family whose kids won't be going to hockey school this year. I'm sure that may resonate with the Speaker and his love of hockey and providing for children. When you think about families having to make those types of decisions, it may not be easy to govern, but it's not easy to raise a family and run a household in this province either. We need to be thinking about those types of people.</p>
<p>I did hear loud and clear last night from the minister about what a difficult job it is, what a monumental task it would be to balance the budget. I don't try to minimize that but I'm sure it probably is a monumental task. It's not a simple task to finance a family either, so in this Chamber we should be looking for ways to make the lives of Nova Scotians better. We should be asking ourselves every day, how can we help the people of Nova Scotia?</p>
<p>We can have a bit of fun back and across the floor about how we may accomplish that but I just worry that we lose sight of that in here. I try not to but I'm sure some members do.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians won't have sympathy for a government that says, well, it's really hard. The job should be hard, and they expect that, but they put us here because they think we can make good decisions on their behalf. They are asking us to make those good decisions in the face of adversity. So when we think about the priorities of a government and we think about what's important to Nova Scotians, I can assure you that a new holiday was not a huge priority to the vast majority of Nova Scotians. They don't really care about another day off; what they care about is providing for their families, being able to pay for what's important to their families.</p>
<p>So here we are; we are getting a good glimpse of the priorities of the government and they are pretty divergent from the priorities of Nova Scotians. We even see - I mean we had a lot of discussion in this Chamber about the cost of running the government and the cost of running departments and trying to focus on how we can control those costs and reduce those costs.</p>
<p>I do just remind the members that that's only part of the equation. We need to find a way to increase the revenue of the province so we can fund more departmental activities. But we always need to think back about - we need to be very conscious of where the money is being spent.</p>
<p>I was concerned back in the Fall when I used to hear statements that we're going to reduce departmental spending by 1 per cent. I have to tell you, I always thought that was a bit of a cop-out, because saying you are going to reduce by a blanket amount is just a statement. How you reduce expenses and how you control expenditures inside a company is line by line, because one department might not be able to do 1 per cent, but another one might be able to do 10 per cent, and you can only do that. So if you kind of minimize (Interruption) I do appreciate the comments of the Minister of Internal Services - maybe his Party will let him stand up and talk on his own one time, but I'd like the floor right now.</p>
<p>The Minister of Internal Services and I had quite a few discussions about one very offensive increased expenditure of the government - a significant increase in the size of the civil service. I echo my colleague's comments about the importance of the work that government does, but I question whether you need 550 more civil servants - and here's where it gets really interesting &#x2026;</p></speech>

If you look at that actual number and compare it to their estimated number, you will see that they are estimating that they will need 550 new FTEs.</p>
<p>The thing that I think will surprise Nova Scotians is when I talked to the government during estimates they say we will never actually fill those 550 positions, and when I ask why, they say you have to account for vacancies and you have to account for this - lots of complicated explanations, shall we say, to a very simple thing. One thing that I have learned is when somebody hides behind complicated explanations, there is probably a reason.</p>
<p>What I find disturbing about the budgeting process is now we have FTEs that have been budgeted for that will never be used, and when you question the minister further on that he says, well, we use that for departments to control expenses. Mr. Speaker, it's a slush fund buried at the departmental level - it is offensive to Nova Scotians and it is offensive to me.</p>
<p>But we're talking about departmental expenses. Now we need to talk about - for the benefit of the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, I'll just let her know that I'm looking at the Budget Estimates and Supplementary Detail, Page 1.14.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, let's talk about how we increase the top line, because that's really what we need to do. We do need new jobs. We don't need fictitious new estimated jobs. We actually need real jobs that people can get up in the morning and go to. Where are we at on that? We hear nothing.</p>
<p>We're speaking today about the HST. Nova Scotians know very well about the HST. They pay the highest taxes in Canada, but we do have a tax review to look forward to. Now, the thing I'm concerned about is the tax review. We already have an indication from the government that we shouldn't expect the tax review to decrease taxes. Mr. Speaker, if we shouldn't expect it to decrease taxes, I think we know what we should expect from the tax review: more taxes piled onto the backs of Nova Scotians to create money to be funnelled into departments, to be spent by people that don't know what they're doing with it, because they don't know how many FTEs they budgeted.</p>
<p>Before I take my chair and let the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board respond, I do want to talk briefly about the (Interruption) I'm so glad that the member for Halifax Chebucto chimed in on this, because I am so sure that he is so delighted to see the highest taxes. I'm sure it's good - as a business owner he would know what an extra vacation day does to businesses. You don't need a crystal ball, Mr. Speaker, to realize the state of this province and the bad decisions that we see being made with our money, the decisions we see being made with the money of Nova Scotians - picked from their pockets with the highest taxes in Canada and distributed through departmental expenses.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll retract the term "picked from their pockets," just in keeping the spirit of collegiality that we have here.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Speaker, before I take my seat, I do feel that it's necessary to talk about the Graduate Retention Rebate. There has been a lot of talk about this and we do hear - I know it's a point of stress for the government. It does seem to hit a nerve when it comes up. The reality is that what has happened is that the trust of young people has been broken, and people who were expecting to benefit from that - whether the government says it does what it was intended to do or not, I don't want to weigh in on that debate today. But what I will say is that the message that it sends to young Nova Scotians is not a good one, and young Nova Scotians - it's too late, maybe - I don't know, maybe I did weigh in. Perhaps it was too late. But the message it sends to young Nova Scotians is not a positive one.</p>
<p>If you're a young Nova Scotian and you're looking at your opportunities in life, and you're looking at where your life could possibly take you, you are definitely looking at places away from Nova Scotia, where they can trust the government to do what it says it's going to do, because we are not seeing that on all accounts.</p>
<p>Maybe on a positive note I will finish up today and say we do have at least three more budgets to look forward to from this government, and maybe in the future we will see a government that has the courage to make the tough decisions, because it's not supposed to be easy. (Interruptions) Mr. Speaker, there is a little bit of education that is required over there, which I'll save for another day.</p>
<p>With those few words, I will say that we can't support this budget, and Nova Scotians won't support this budget, but I appreciate you for your time today. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I only want to say a few words on closing debate for this bill. I know everybody has other bills they want to get to as well, but it's a very important bill. The FMA is the sister bill to the budget, which we voted on about a week ago. It is also the plan for the coming year for the Province of Nova Scotia. It's how we're going to care for the needs and the programs that people rely on, how we're going to ensure that we have summer student programs.</p>
<p>This year, 50 per cent more students will be hired than last year in this province. There are hundreds more students who will be working this summer in small communities where there are very few jobs available; many of them will find positions. That's very important.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we carried through on our commitments in this budget. That was a key thing for us, to look at the campaign commitments and carry through on them. That has been very much reflected particularly in our reinvestment in education, which had $65 million removed from it over the last four years. That's very important. The members of the Opposition have seen it, they know it's in there. There will be a lot of improvements at the classroom level in every case.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak a little bit about the path forward as well, and the need for co-operation. A number of members have spoken, and the critic most recently from the Progressive Conservative Party has spoken. It's important that we try and speak the same language. I know that the honourable member is an accountant, and so am I. You need to look at estimate-to-estimate to get an accurate picture.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if the member is so fond of forecast-to-estimate, I'd like to remind him to look at the last budget of the Progressive Conservative Government under Rodney MacDonald in 2009 - Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member is listening about the last budget of the Progressive Conservative Government in 2009. If you wanted then to compare apples to oranges, you would have had 900 differences in the number of FTEs, 900 in that time. It's not accurate.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#patrick.dunn"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, with this bill that we are looking at is the 160-year long tradition of the bishop as chancellor of St. FX University. A 160-year-long tradition as chancellor, I think, definitely should be respected. What do we have to gain from passing this bill? We will please a few, and ignore the mass of alumni and traditions of this university, 160 years. Is that the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the board participated in a secret ballot to basically remove the bishop as chancellor. You wonder why the board chose to do it this way. Was there a broad consultation? Is there someone with an internal agenda? In fact, a member of the community who donated $1 million to the university knew nothing about this, knew nothing about the internal decision of the board.</p>
<p>Is the bishop really in agreement with this legislation? I really don't think so, Mr. Speaker. Was the bishop appropriately represented? I'm not so sure, Mr. Speaker. He did participate at the committee level. How much? Who knows? I believe they met three times in the past 12 months. The cards were definitely stacked against him. Does he still have the opportunity to be chancellor? Well, perhaps on paper.</p>
<p>The communications officer for St. FX performed very well at the Committee on Private and Local Bills earlier today, and she covered all the bases very well, Mr. Speaker. The bishop, Sisters of St. Martha and Sisters of Notre Dame created this university, and we should at least honour this religious foundation and keep it in the religious order. That was one alternative that they had, to allow the chancellor of this university to be someone from St. Martha or Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a mistake, a movement by a few as opposed to a decision by the broader alumni base. It is ironic how a few people can make such an alarming change in this university. I am sure former alumni across this province, country and globe will be dismayed when they hear the news. In fact, having the opportunity to speak to former alumni in Cape Breton, Guysborough, Antigonish County and Pictou County recently, they knew nothing about this; it has been well hidden. It continues to amaze me how so few can alter the fabric and tradition of this university.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, having said those few words, again I'm dismayed that this bill is before the House and dismayed that the member for Antigonish and the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie have supported this particular bill. Thank you.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#randy.delorey"><from>HON. RANDY DELOREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, since the member opposite has concern about the position on the bill, I'd like to clarify. As the member for Antigonish, I can state for the record that I am a Catholic as well, a practising Catholic, just to put perspective into context, in terms of this bill and how it has moved forward.</p>
<p>I can also say that I am an alumnus of St. Francis Xavier University and I'm also a former faculty member from that institution so I'm well aware of the history behind this particular bill. Just for the benefit of all members of the House and members of the public, this particular change that has come forward, at the request of the institution, to my colleague here, the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie, it was brought forward and asked for by the institution.</p>
<p>Within the institution this particular request for this change was brought forward by students, by the students that the Opposition Parties have argued so often that this government does not hear from and does not listen to. This bill clearly demonstrates that the institution and this government do listen to the students in Nova Scotia. This particular change that was requested stemmed from, most importantly, a concern for a public institution, so without denying or ignoring the history of this great institution, we must, as a government, recognize that this institution is now a public institution, an institution that is the responsibility of the Government of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In that regard we must, as a government, recognize the importance of equity in all our public institutions. That is the primary concern that was brought forward to motivate this change in the governing structure of that institution.</p>
<p>In its current form, the Chancellor of St. Francis Xavier University can never, ever be a woman. That was a very, very concerning fact for students and faculty at St. Francis Xavier University. That's why they brought that request forward. Given that the majority of students who attend St. Francis Xavier University are women, one must consider what signal it sends, the institution to its students and to the broader public, when it is not willing and it maintains an historical position only on the basis of history.</p>
<p>There are many things in history that have changed over time, that have evolved, and not all change is negative; not all change is bad. It is clearly the consensus of the Board of Governors of St. Francis Xavier University, we'll see in a few moments if it is the consensus of this government, that change in this instance is positive; that a public institution needs to represent the broader public and allow an opportunity for all people, no matter their religious background, their gender, their sexual orientation or any other criteria, from being Chancellor of St. Francis Xavier University, going forward.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, what this piece of legislation, if you read through it - as was noted but perhaps not well enough that some members continue to criticize this piece of legislation - it was noted in the first reading by the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie that the institution and this legislation respects and acknowledges the significant contribution of the Catholic Church and the Diocese of Antigonish in the history of this fantastic institution. They've created in this piece of legislation a specific position that will remain accessible and in the purview of the bishop of the Diocese of Antigonish as a member of the board of governors for the institution. That position will always be there in recognition of the founding work that the diocese and the Catholic Church have done in establishing and developing the great institution that we have today.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the institution itself on the ground continues to have an active chaplaincy and it's active and engaged and very, very well respected. Any suggestion that this particular piece of legislation in any way diminishes the pride that the Catholics that continue to attend St. Francis Xavier University or the pride that Catholics in the alumni of St. Francis Xavier University have in the institution, I think, is inappropriate.</p>
<p>I think it's important to note that the only criticism that I've heard about this bill does come from Catholics. It is a little bit disheartening, as a Catholic myself, to hear that, because one of the fundamental tenets of our religion is one of being open and accepting of others. What this piece of legislation does is it opens up the institution, a public institution, while at the same time simultaneously recognizing the important historical contributions of the Catholic Church and the Diocese of Antigonish by maintaining the bishop as a member of the board of governors. And it does not prevent the bishop from being elected to the position of chancellor. It does not prevent any member of the board of governors from that position going forward.</p>
<p>While I respect and appreciate the concerns that have been raised by those who have raised them, I do hope that in considering this piece of legislation in its entirety, in the context in which it was presented, that they do consider supporting this piece of legislation as well. It is very important to demonstrate that our future is not always to be directed and moved based upon our history, that we can change and evolve, and that sometimes change is good. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thought we were going to see a miracle today. When we were in the committee meeting, we had a vote. The first vote was a tie - it was three-three. Then we had a second vote, and it was a four-four tie. The chairman voted, and I was thinking in my mind, what is going to happen? Are we going to see something special happen here? We didn't, because the chairman did vote, as really I expected, with his colleagues. But it was funny, for a few seconds there I was wondering, are we going to see something happen here? Now, it didn't happen, and I respect the member's comments opposite, and I think this is a matter that we'll have to agree to disagree on.</p>
<p>I do want to make some points. I know for any government, when you've brought forward a bill like this, at first glance - often these bills, as we know, get very little attention. They're often about something in somebody's area that really has nothing to do with our own areas and the areas we represent. I can also appreciate that when you have an institution coming to you and this affects legislation that pertains to their institution, that you would trust them, that what they want makes sense, they're coming forward with something they want. It would make sense to agree with it. It would also bolster the case if it was brought to the government with people who are very professional in terms of communications.</p>
<p>I'm going to make some points here that you may not have heard, and I did make some of them over there today. I fully expect the members opposite will be passing this bill but I'm going to put these points on the record so that you are aware of them, because they do conflict with some of the things you have heard.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a few things and I'm going to try to not make it too long because I know - and I could try to hold this bill up in the Legislature and push in to next week but I know it is likely not going to make a difference anyway. I'm conscious of that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the member opposite - one of the big issues that I've heard brought up about this is equity, and while I am here to represent the people of Inverness, I'm also a Catholic. People often say the Catholic Church is behind the times. People have opinions on that. I think of my cousin who I referenced, who is a saint. Now people probably wonder, what the heck is a saint? (Interruption) Somebody said their wife is a saint, he is probably correct - but in all seriousness, these matters come down to faith.</p>
<p>Faith is not something that you can write; in fact, Mr. Speaker, I was at Mass on the weekend - if it wasn't this weekend, I believe it might have been the weekend before - and in the gospel it spoke about Jesus and about the doubt and the disciple who wanted to put his finger in the wounds.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Mary MacKillop is my cousin, I'm very proud of that. I have to go all the way back to Scotland to connect those dots but they're there. When her people were leaving Scotland they ended up in Australia and mine ended up in Canada. Mr. Speaker, this will continue to be debated but my faith as a Catholic tells me, it gives me - a lot of it is about humility and really, why do people leave the church?</p>
<p>You go into a church now on Sunday and there are not a lot of young people there. One of the reasons I think that is - the members opposite say, maybe it's because the church is behind the times, but you know why I think it is? It's because we've lost our humility. We're too busy to say we know what's best, and member opposite, I think you've just done it yourself when you contradicted me there. I don't want to go down that road but I do think that - and it's true of me as it's true of anybody else - I have my own pride and sometimes it gets in the way of my thinking and my decisions, but a person's pride separates them from God, I believe - I almost feel like I should be in a church right now, not in the Legislature.</p>
<p>My intent is not to lecture people but I'm just telling you what I see, and I think that we can come up with a million reasons to remove the bishop as chancellor and as head of St. F.X. but my one reason why I think the bishop should be there is because the bishop is ultimately the representative of the diocese. The diocese started the university.</p>
<p>I think of - and I mentioned it the other day in my speech - I think of St. Mary MacKillop, it was a bishop who excommunicated her for a reason that was not relevant and that excommunication was later lifted. Her faith was tested but she had humility. She didn't leave the church, she didn't stop her work. Her heart was focused on her work, which was helping the people that were forgotten in society, educating women as one thing, Mr. Speaker. So for people to say that the church is not an institution of equity, I say they're wrong, and if you feel otherwise, stand up and say what you believe.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we say this is now a public institution. I was speaking to somebody outside the Chamber today and they were saying that this has happened at other universities - it has happened at Acadia and other universities and nobody is really going to care about this.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if that's the case, then why don't they change the name of the university? If it's no longer going to be a Catholic university, why don't you take the name of the saint off the university? What would that do to the university? I think that would speak volumes about what it would do to the university.</p>
<p>Why don't you take - and I know we're not allowed to use props in here - why don't you take the "X" off the ring because X refers to St. Francis Xavier.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. I do remind the honourable member that he just violated the rule that he just referred to, so I'm obligated to enforce my rules.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Inverness has the floor.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>To me, I mean the X is there because of St. Francis Xavier, and we're really getting to the integrity of what the university is about. I know one of the things that struck me at the end of the presentation today by the group that was in favour of this, that was representing the university, one of the things that was said was that they wanted to keep the best and they didn't want divisions. Mr. Speaker, if you're getting rid of the very integrity of the founding of the university, that is really to me what is the best of the university.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I could speak all day and I don't think it's going to make a lot of difference. There are a couple of things I should put on the record. One of the things said today in the committee was that there are just as many representatives from the church on this board as compared to an institution like Notre Dame, which I referenced the other day in second reading.</p>
<p>I want to make the point that the percentage of the voice that the church holds on the board, I believe it's eight people, it's on a board of well over 20 people, whereas at Notre Dame there are six priests on a board of twelve - totally different. These are important facts, Mr. Speaker, because I believe they refute some of the points that have been made to support this bill.</p>
<p>The bishop is not going to have the same authority any longer. People say, well, the bishop is still going to be the vicar-founder and they've even said the bishop has suggested that. It needs to be put on the record that there was a secret ballot, as my colleague had referenced, because people didn't want the bishop to know that they were voting him off the board.</p>
<p>You can imagine how the bishop felt after that vote. You can imagine how he felt that people sitting around him didn't value his position on the board any longer. I know also with the shame of the previous bishop and we all know he is no longer even a priest, Mr. Speaker, because of his actions, and I won't get into that, but there's probably not a lot of strong feeling of confidence in an environment like that, especially when people around you want you off the board.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I should finish up. There are other points I could mention but if the government insists on putting this forward and insists on supporting it, people will know. It's not going to end here - this will be something that will continue to be discussed. I think it will be discussed more broadly outside of the circles where it has been discussed, because it has been very carefully managed, including coming into this Legislature.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know when I wear my X ring, I'm going to wear it knowing the university and its history and where it has come from, and I don't think that is something that I want to disassociate myself with - it's something I'm proud of. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>If I recognize the member it will be to close the debate.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#lloyd.hines"><from>MR. LLOYD HINES</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague opposite for his thoughtful presentation on the matter. I also want to thank my colleague, the member for Antigonish for his incisive view of what is happening here.</p>
<p>I am also a proud Catholic, Mr. Speaker, and an alumnus of St. F.X. and I am extremely proud of that university. I must admit it wasn't in the last decade that I graduated from there - or even the second last decade - but I will tell you that I have been amply proud of the forward thinking that has occurred at that university for many years - certainly when I was there, and particularly in the last little while.</p>
<p>If you look at the former president - and we're welcoming a new president into the university - he did a masterful job of moving that university forward, both in its efficacy and also its brick-and-mortar portion. The enrolment at that university has continued to grow, and I'm very proud of that institution.</p>
<p>I'm also proud of the progressive nature of this particular legislation that we have before us, Bill No. 50, an Act to Amend and Consolidate the Acts Relating to St. Francis Xavier University. This legislation has not been substantially altered since 1957 - that's 57 years. There were things in the existing legislation that needed to be refreshed - associations with the University College of Cape Breton and Mount St. Bernard College, where the recitals in the previous Act counted those organizations as having board seats - but this is certainly about more than housekeeping.</p>
<p>I would like to direct the House's attention to Clause 4(a) of the legislation. It says, "The objects of the University are to provide students with a post-secondary education that is intellectually stimulating and personally enriching within an atmosphere of inclusiveness for all students, Faculty and staff." I believe that's what this does.</p>
<p>Clause 4(d) says that it is an objective of the university to "respect the Catholic heritage and character that have formed a vital part of the University's history." As has been so very well-articulated by previous speakers, that is something that everybody can be proud of, because it is a public institution. In particular, in deference to the significant and ongoing important role that the Catholic Church will play in this institution, Clause 15(1) says, "In light of the historical and continuing relationship between the Diocese and the University, the Bishop shall occupy the position of the Vicar of the Founder of the University." I think that amply recognizes the antecedents, the great work that was done by the church in founding this particular university.</p>
<p>The proposed changes have been under development for over three years, in consultation with representatives of all key stakeholder groups: students, the clergy, faculty, and alumni. The proposed changes strike an appropriate balance between the honoured and cherished history and traditions of our institution and the 21<sup>st</sup> Century reality in which the university is operating.</p>
<p>Historically, only the bishop could serve in the role of chancellor. Concerns were raised that this discriminated on the basis of marital status, gender, and religion. It was also noted - and this is very important - that the role of chancellor in universities has changed a bit. Chancellors of universities are increasingly involved in high-profile promotion and fundraising for their respective university. This is a role which perhaps doesn't naturally fit with the pastoral and other duties of a bishop.</p>
<p>There's ample evidence before us why this is a sensible and progressive move. The thing to recall and to take away is that the bishop remains a member of the board, and this legislation creates a separate, distinct role that maintains the historic connection and provides future opportunities relevant for today's students. The Vicar of the Founder position has been created in the proposed Act.</p>
<p>To wind up, students, faculty, alumni, priests, and the bishop have been involved and have signed off on the changes. The stakeholders have spoken and are in agreement. I would move to close debate on Bill No. 50.</p></speech>

<p>I believe these amendments play to the significant role grandparents have in a child's life, especially those children whose parents are going through difficult times, and in situations where parents are separating. Grandparents have had a two-step process to making access applications up till now. The legislation does eliminate a step for grandparents who need the court's help to have any contact with their grandchildren. The family court system will continue to address these cases with the best interest of the child in mind, and finally, Mr. Speaker, I believe that this legislation is an important step for our justice system and for grandparents, children, and parents in Nova Scotia, thank you.</p></speech>

<p>So I only ask - no, really. The only thing, when I was reading over the bill, that I would ask the minister to seriously consider - because once again, we're in favour of this, we know that it's going to be a good thing for Nova Scotia - but under Clause 8(1)(a) and (b), I just hope that when you consider your board, that you remember that there are taxpayers who are from Yarmouth right to Neil's Harbour, Cape North, and that maybe they will have their board not just filled with people from this metro area, that they will consider everyone across the province to serve on this board and give all Nova Scotia a chance to have a say.

I know the minister, during his closing on second reading, said he would look at that.</p>
<p>The department did look at it and brought changes forward that equally benefit the province and the municipality in case, in the future, we see the sale of the convention centre.

          <speech by="#karen.casey"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move Bill No. 63 for third reading. I'm only going to make a few comments about this but I feel I need to respond to the amendments that have been presented and to thank the member for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg for bringing those amendments to the floor.</p>
<p>We have talked at the bill briefing, we've had the introduction, we've had second reading, we've had the Fowler report tabled and we've had my response tabled, so I think everybody is very clear on what the bill is. But to the member opposite, one of the amendments spoke to the distance travelled and time on bus and those kinds of things, which are real concerns in every rural community that we have. When those amendments came forward to me, I reviewed them personally and I recognize that those are the kinds of details that will be included in the minister's policy that supports the bill. In the piece of legislation, it is not the place for that detail, but I want to assure the member those details will be part of the minister's policy.</p>
<p>Also, some of the comments that were made about the distance travelled - I did a little bit of checking to confirm. I know that provincially we have guidelines for how long students should be on bus. They are guidelines. We know that boards have their own guidelines within the provincial ones and for the Cape Breton board in particular, I'm sure the member is aware of this, the provincial guideline is 3.6 kilometres. Beyond that, students are to be bused, and the Cape Breton guideline information that I've received is that for Primary to Grade 6 students, it's 1 kilometre, and for Grades 7 to 9, it's 2.5 kilometres. Both of those distances that are articulated by the board as guidelines are well within the provincial guidelines.</p>
<p>The time, of course, has been suggested, and every board tries to live within that one hour of travel time. But as the member would know, sometimes if it takes longer to get from a child's home to the school and there's no other place to go, the board is sometimes pressed with living within that, but it is a guideline and it's something that they strive for.</p>
<p>The other amendment that came forward was to go back and look at the number of schools that had been closed under the previous legislation, the previous process. When we had said in the beginning that this is go-forward, this is a new piece of legislation, we recognized that every community has gone through a difficult time, a very emotional time, and if we were to go back and reopen that, there would be 25 of those communities that would have to go through that same process again.</p>
<p>We recognize that much or all of some of the decisions that have been made over the last 15 or 20 years regarding school closure might not have been the first choice for a community. Those decisions have been made and we're moving forward with a new process which we believe allows for more co-operation, more collaboration, more understanding and more long-range planning.</p>
<p>As I've said before, we hope that no longer will a board spring upon a community that their school will be closing. Mr. Speaker, with those few comments, I will take my seat.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I echo my colleague's comments in that I do support the bill, and I thank the minister for having the initiative to look at the school closure process because I have seen first-hand how flawed the old process was, just over the past few months and attending some of the meetings and watching the school board in action.</p>
<p>I just want to put on the record about the request to go back and look at some of the - I think the language was - the "recent" school closures, that was certainly the intent of it. I know the minister - I would understand the minister's reluctance to go back over a number of years she said there, but I think she said 25 schools. I think on this side, we're concerned about four schools, and we're concerned about schools inside the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board, because there was a time not too long ago when the government said it asked the school boards around the province to stop their school review processes. I believe I'm correct in saying that Chignecto-Central was the only one that didn't. So, for whatever reason, they did not. They continued with their review process.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of the school in my own constituency, Highland Consolidated, the vote to close Highland Consolidated, I believe it was March 18<sup>th</sup> or 19<sup>th</sup>. It was pretty much yesterday in my mind, Mr. Speaker. So I would understand the minister's reluctance to open up things over some period of years, but having seen the way that that board operated - and the very night that the school board was voting to close that school, there were comments made by some of the school board members as they sat around the table that made it absolutely clear that they didn't know what they were talking about, quite frankly. That was very disappointing.</p>
<p>I've said before in this House that I can accept decisions that are made, and quite often when you sit on this side, you simply have to accept decisions that are made. But when you see decisions that are made and come out of a failed process, you know that what built up to that process is broken, it makes it very hard to accept that decision. Sometimes we see the government do things, we may not agree with them, but we do respect that there was a process that happened over there through their caucus, through their Cabinet there is a process that happened. The decision comes and it is what it is. But when you see a school board making a decision that impacts an entire community forever, and you know that they didn't have a process and they just made a decision, it's pretty disheartening.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I know the minister is very well aware of the situation at Highland Consolidated, and the other three or four schools that we're talking about in Chignecto. I feel like she listening, so I appreciate that. I will accept the minister's decision because I will know that she has been thoughtful of what we're saying, so I appreciate that. I am happy that the process is about to change, because the process was broken and I would just say that maybe she might think of some of the decisions that were made, just very recently, under a broken process and say you know what? Those were decisions that were made under a failed process and maybe I should look at them.</p>
<p>So I'll just leave the minister with that, but I will support the minister and I do thank her for bringing this forward.</p></speech>

I'm really appreciative of the fact that we have minimum standards, and I hope we'll have a maximum standard. Again, I appreciate and I'll be looking forward to supporting this bill and I know the minister is listening, so thank you for that.</p>

The request that went out from the minister of the day in 2013 was simply an ask and all boards except one did respect that.</p>
<p>I have stated in this House that I have written to that board chairman asking that they would consider giving those last three schools that additional year to come up with some kind of proposal that might allow the schools in those communities to stay open. I'm waiting to hear from the decision of the board, but I certainly did ask him, the board chairman did say that that would go to the committee the first week of May.</p>
<p>One more point to clarify - the 25 would be schools that would be closing, the decision has already been made, the school has not been closed, they will start closing as of the end of June of 2014. So we're not going back years - from 2008 until now it would be 42, for the next move forward its 25.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, very briefly this bill is legislation as a result of the Dr. Traves' report. We asked for review of the economic development tools used by the Province of Nova Scotia for encouraging economic development initiatives. This board will now be independent of government and will be able to make investment decisions in the best interests of our province. It is given a broad mandate involving sector development, new technologies and a range of other options for growing our economy.</p>
<p>I look forward, once this bill clears this House, to working on naming the initial board for Invest Nova Scotia. I am confident that when members of the House and Nova Scotians see the ladies and gentlemen who will make up the first board, that they will see how serious our government is in ensuring that not only do we have the best people, but they are truly making investment decisions independent of government and in the best interests of Nova Scotians. Merci.</p></speech>

The people of Nova Scotia work hard for their money and they would like to see this money put into a board, a group of people that are non-partisan and have no influence.</p>
<p>It's really not a step forward. Once again, we just cannot agree on this bill. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's not very often that I find myself in agreement with a gentleman who would be known to probably most members of this House, Mr. Ross Haynes. Mr. Haynes has a letter, I think, in today's newspaper. I don't know who would be more surprised, he or me, that we're in agreement. But he made some pretty interesting points about the role of elected officials and the fact that we ultimately are the people who should be accountable and held accountable for decisions with respect to the expenditure of public funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we have made our concerns known about the government's proposal and plan. We essentially see no significant change in this bill, and the Premier himself has said that business will continue as usual.</p>
<p>As well, this is not what the Premier and his Party committed to and told Nova Scotians that would be put in place if they were to form the government. You know, the previous Jobs Fund was set up with an arm's-length group of very experienced and very credible businesspeople led by Mr. Ron MacDonald, who is well known and well respected in the business community around the province. They reviewed applications and made recommendations to a committee of elected officials.</p>
<p>There's essentially no difference. We have a new name here and a different committee. Mr. Speaker, this is a bit of a shell game, and again it's a Liberal Government that is delivering something that is quite significantly different than what was advertised. For that reason, we will not be supporting this bill.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#michel.p.samson"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by the members of the Opposition. The member for Pictou West again says that the Official Opposition will not be supporting this bill because it doesn't give all of the authorities of investments to NSBI - Nova Scotia Business Incorporated.</p>
<p>She would be aware that Dr. Tom Traves explored that very issue in his report. In his report, Dr. Traves said, do not send it to Nova Scotia Business Incorporated. He says it very specifically in his report. So we have an independent report from the former President of Dalhousie University telling us do not send it to NSBI, yet the Official Opposition says, disregard the independent report and do as we say.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we don't believe that's the way we should do business here. We asked for an independent report and we believe we should follow those recommendations. But at the same time, while the Official Opposition says it should all be sent to NSBI, you'll recall that it was the same member for Pictou West during the session that would ask questions of me to justify decisions made by Nova Scotia Business Incorporated with some of the investments that they brought to our government. You can't have it both ways. You can't say you want NSBI to be responsible for all economic development in this province, and then stand in the House and start criticizing NSBI.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, during the session, we even saw one day where the member for Pictou West got up and asked me questions about a certain investment that had been made, and when I asked her which company she was referring to, she refused to answer. She kept going on with her questions and wouldn't name the company, because they didn't want to criticize the company in question. So they were being cute by just asking about the investment without naming the company. Nova Scotians could see right through that and see what the Official Opposition was trying to do, but clearly Nova Scotians supported those investments that were being made.</p>
<p>I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that I'm disappointed - not surprised, but disappointed - to hear the Leader of the NDP suggest that the Invest Nova Scotia Board is no different than the Jobs Fund. She knows that's not the case. The advisory board she refers to was an advisory board whose decisions no one knew of. No one knew what they were telling Executive Council. No one knew if they were saying this was a good investment, this was not a good investment. It was never shared with Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>What we now know after the Auditor General's Report is that on various occasions the advisory board of the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund said no to investments that Executive Council overturned and approved. Now, Executive Council has every right to do that. Executive Council runs the government. They had every right to do that. But by not sharing with Nova Scotians the fact that their own advisory board said no, we believe is not the way to ensure transparency, accountability, and good government for the people for Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Which is why, Mr. Speaker - we have made it very clear, and the Premier has made it very clear and our government has made it very clear - the Invest Nova Scotia Board will have the sole authority for making investment decisions on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia without any interference at all from the government of the day, and we certainly hope any future governments that will be in place, that they do allow this to continue to be an independent process.</p>
<p>More importantly, all decisions of Invest Nova Scotia will be posted online. We are the first government in Canada that has allowed a website that is going to show all of the economic development decisions and investments made on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia. It is now live, people can access it now, it is being updated, and it is being accountable to the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I would say that when we look at Bill No. 67, when we look at the Accountability in Economic Development Assistance Act from the Fall, when we look at the actions of this government, and when we look at the leadership from our Premier, I would say that when it came to the question of being accountable to the people of Nova Scotia when it comes to economic development, when it comes to investing their hard-earned money, when it comes to being transparent, the Premier and this government have delivered.

I want to thank all members of the House for this session and the work they have done on behalf of Nova Scotians; particularly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and the Deputy Speaker. I think it is fair to say all members know this, when you head into a budget session there's a tremendous amount of added stress but this session has been unique in many ways, in my time being here. I know some prior to me had put in long hours before but the fact that we were sitting at 12:01 a.m. and many continuous days we were sitting here, coming back quite late at night, put a great deal of added stress on the staff in this place. The Pages were recognized earlier, the Clerks, all members who work on behalf of the people of this province did a tremendous job.</p>
<p>I particularly want to acknowledge and recognize the Commissionaires who went through what were some difficult days and difficult legislation in this House, acted very professionally and ensured that people's access to this building was continued and allowed to happen in an orderly way, and they did so in an extremely professional manner. I want to thank them. (Applause)</p>
<p>Of course, I want to thank the Sergeant-at-Arms who is here. (Applause) I want to thank him for not kicking anyone out on this side of the House. The Sergeant-at-Arms has been here in many capacities, representing the people of the province and ensuring that the House continues to move along. To him, we appreciate that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, to staff members who work for all of the caucuses, for the work they have done on behalf of each member of our individual caucuses and what they've done on behalf of the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. While, as I think I heard earlier today, we may not always agree with the decisions that each side of the House takes, we do respect the process that goes through that and quite frankly, without the great staff that we have, it would make this job that much more challenging at times. So, on behalf of all of us, to the staff who are here and those who are listening, I want to thank and express my great appreciation for the work that they do. (Applause)</p>
<p>Finally, but surely not last, I want to thank the media. (Interruption) Don't jump, guys, don't jump; whatever you do, don't jump. (Laughter)</p>
