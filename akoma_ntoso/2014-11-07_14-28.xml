KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, mother and daughter Kim and Erica MacKeen from Tatamagouche-Colchester North represented the province at the Interprovincial Equestrian Championships on October 3<sup>rd</sup> in Blainville, Quebec. Kim, an endurance rider for many years, gradually became more involved with dressage; 13-year old Erica, who began riding at age 5, was first interested in jumping but gradually she turned to dressage, like her mother.</p>
<p>Dressage is an intricate equestrian sport which unifies the bond between horse and rider and is also known as horse ballet. Kim placed eighth in her run at the championship while Erica, the youngest competitor in dressage, finished 10<sup>th</sup>. The chance to represent the province at the Interprovincial Equestrian Championships, especially as the first mother and daughter team, was both a unique and gratifying experience for the MacKeens.</p></speech>

<p>Ceremonies will take place in local schools, churches and Nakile Home for Special Care. They have also been invited to services of two Yarmouth schools, Veterans Place, and Yarmouth Wesleyan Church as time permits. They conduct the ceremonies at the Tusket cenotaph, followed by a ceremony at Saint Michael's Church in Wedgeport, and host a banquet at the Legion hall.</p>
<p>They work tirelessly in the community promoting their branch and its members. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their dedication.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#sterling.belliveau">
            <from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from>
            <p>Firewood is the most accessible and affordable renewable energy resource for home heating in much of North America. Its use can help us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because its net carbon dioxide is far below all other fuels. It provides heating security during electrical power failures. Wood and firewood that is cut and used locally means money does not leave the community to pay for oil and gas. To be continued, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p class="hsd_center"><b>HEADS UP, HALIFAX! CAMPAIGN</b></p></speech>
          <speech by="#brendan.o.maguire"><from>MR. BRENDAN MAGUIRE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of the Heads Up, Halifax! campaign. November 5<sup>th</sup> was the Crosswalk Safety Awareness Day in Halifax and volunteers handed out literature at many crosswalks throughout the city. This kicked off HRM's Heads Up, Halifax! campaign to educate people about the importance of crosswalk safety. On September 6<sup>th</sup> an elderly woman was struck in the crosswalk at Williams Lake Road and Herring Cove Road and died from her injuries. Just this week there was another serious pedestrian-vehicle accident on the corner of Dentith Road and Herring Cove Road.</p>
<p>In fact, there have been 151 pedestrian-vehicle injuries in Halifax from January to September 2014. This is up 70 per cent over the same period from last year. The majority of these accidents have occurred in crosswalks. I applaud HRM for introducing their Heads Up, Halifax! campaign in response to this ever-increasing problem in our city - remember, inattention can be fatal; heads up, Halifax. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <heading>STALLARD, DOUG: SERV. - THANK</heading>
          <speech by="#patrick.dunn"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as Remembrance Day draws close once again, I would like to take this time to pay tribute to one of our World War II veterans, Mr. Doug Stallard. Doug was born on February 14, 1922, in New Glasgow where he continues to live. Doug enlisted in the Army and was transferred to the Air Force in 1940. He was trained in Manitoba and Saskatchewan before being deployed overseas in 1941. He was involved in the fighting until 1945 when he was discharged. Like so many of the veterans from his era, he is incredibly humble and believes he did what he needed to do during those years.</p>
<p>Mr. Stallard continues to be a vital part of our community and we are very proud to call him one of our own. I look forward to seeing Doug out at one of the many Remembrance Day services in our area next week and take this time today to sincerely thank him for his service. Thank you.</p></speech>

They were founded in 1969 to assist African Nova Scotian communities develop strategies toward an equitable education system. The Black Educators Association of Nova Scotia has been involved in the establishment and the development of many programs and projects including the bursary fund, math camp, and adult learning programs.

          <speech by="#pam.eyking"><from>MS. PAM EYKING</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the concerns of community members and health care workers as changes in our health care system and services are being made. I understand that decisions need to be made around how our health care dollars can be spent more effectively. These decisions will impact how health care is delivered and managed. Often in rural ridings such as my own, people see these changes as detrimental to small hospitals and rural services. ER closures; doctor, nurse, and tech shortages and recruitment challenges; change in lab services; and access to care are some of the major concerns for my constituents.</p>
<p>Community groups, with their insights into community dynamics, challenges, and strengths need to be included in the decision-making process around short-term and long-term health care plans because ultimately it is the community that will be impacted. I'm pleased that this government will engage in discussions and consultation with community groups such as the Friends of the Northside General, to work toward health care solutions that work for communities. Thank you.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. LARRY HARRISON</from>
            <p>With Remembrance Day coming up, I want to acknowledge the work that the schools in Brookfield do to prepare. The teachers and students have a special time set every year to recognize those who served and protected us in the Armed Services. I have been part of these presentations for years and I'm amazed at the quality of these services. They research particular battles; they research particular veterans in the area, select one or two and give a presentation on them. The school trips every year are geared to areas in Europe where Canadian servicemen fought and died. I'm looking forward to this year's time with the schools on Monday as they remember their history and are thankful for what has been given to them.</p>

          <speech by="#suzanne.lohnes.croft"><from>MS. SUZANNE LOHNES-CROFT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as a young girl, my family made regular donations of gently-used, warm clothing for those who needed it, to the Brunswick Street Mission. The Brunswick Street Mission is an outreach program of Brunswick Street United Church here in Halifax. It seeks to inspire a better quality of life through a ministry of care that addresses physical, emotional, practical and spiritual needs to those experiencing poverty.</p>
<p>In my adult years, I still find myself making regular trips to the mission, like I did yesterday, to drop off clothing. The mission has operated a clothing bank - just one of the many programs it runs - for at least 40 years. It is one of the last organizations in the area that does not sell donated items, giving each item as freely as it was given to them. I feel that this time of year is a good time to think about the mission, to think about those who need warm clothes, or a warm meal, as the winter approaches. Like the people it supports, the mission also needs help and if you're fortunate enough to be able, I ask that you consider the Brunswick Street Mission. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from>
            <p>Remembrance Day holds special significance for my family. My parents both lived through World War II in Holland as young children. To say that the liberation of Holland by Canadian soldiers meant something to them would be an understatement. Even in their early 80s, I still hear new recollections of the events of the war. My mother's family suffered through three months of Canadian artillery shelling late in 1944 as the Canadian army fought to liberate the island they lived on, to secure access to the Port of Antwerp. Recently, I heard of the first Canadian soldier they met. He was a young man covered head to toe in mud who stood up out of a ditch. Her father immediately went up to shake his hand. That winter they had a Canadian soldier living near them who shared food with her family. Our family is grateful beyond words for the sacrifice of Canada to liberate Holland. (Applause)</p>

          <speech by="#joyce.treen"><from>MS. JOYCE TREEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to you today about a special event that happened in my riding last weekend. On Sunday, October 22<sup>nd</sup>, I attended a pre-Remembrance Day ceremony at 12 Wing, Shearwater, paying respects to our Canadian veterans. It was very touching, and a memorial event as the Stadacona Band, along with the pipe and drum band, performed beautifully during the ceremony. It was attended by personnel from 12 Wing, along with distinguished members from our local Royal Canadian Legion, another veterans' association.</p>
<p>It was an honour and a privilege for me to meet one of the veterans from World War II and to have the opportunity to speak to him about his experience. This gathering provided an opportunity for our local veterans to socialize with serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces and special guests. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Colonel Bourgon, Wing Commander, for the invitation to have me join her in such a prestigious ceremony. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

<p>We observe this date so that we may come to understand and appreciate what those who have served Canada stand for and what they have sacrificed for our country and our freedom. May we accept that freedom is not free, nor does it come without risk.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#karen.casey"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On October 18<sup>th</sup> Tri County Ford located in Tatamagouche, Colchester North, celebrated 80 years of business on the North Shore. James MacKeen started the business in 1934 operating from his home and began a long and happy relationship with the Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p>He built the original dealership in 1946 and later sold the business to his son-in-law, Mervin, and his business partner, Ron Creighton. Ron bought Mervin's share of the company in 1990 and in 1995 built the new dealership on the current property. James MacKeen's son, Eric, is the general manager, and over the years the dealership has won numerous awards for customer service and sales based largely on the can-do attitude of the dedicated staff. An important part of the economy of the North Shore, Tri County is also well known for its support in community events.</p>
<p>I was pleased to have the honour of cutting the ribbon of the new building front at the celebration on October 18<sup>th</sup> as they celebrated that 80<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the dealership.</p></speech>

<p>In 1977 he received a visitor from his war days. Ferdinand DeWilde, the Consulate General of Belgium to Canada, remembered Hughie from the time they spent together in Amsterdam.

<p>Hughie was like many veterans, they returned to their families and the lives they had left before the war began, working in fields, in the factories, on the oceans - Hughie raised a large family and made his living as carpenter and a snowplow operator.

From the land of their birth in Holland, the family looked first to Ontario and then to Nova Scotia for plentiful farmland. They found it in southwest Mabou. John and Ted van Zutphen were young boys when they arrived in 1952, but they became pillars of leadership for their community. Their determination, commitment and business acumen have seen their construction company develop into a significant economic contributor for our province.</p>
<p>The van Zutphen family has employed many talented Nova Scotians as engineers, heavy equipment operators, mechanics, labourers and office administrators. The risks they have taken to grow their business have meant our people have not had to leave home to seek employment. They built an extended family with the communities they settled in and we are proud they chose to live here in their Nova Scotian home.

          <speech by="#lloyd.hines"><from>MR. LLOYD HINES</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Fred MacIntyre of Ingonish in Cape Breton, who joined the North Novies in New Glasgow in 1941. Fred served in active service in Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Germany, being released from active service in November 1945 at Halifax. He proudly displayed the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal and clasp, the 1939-45 Star, the Italy Star, the France and Germany Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal.</p>
<p>Like all veterans, Fred would never speak of his war service. His family knew, however, that while staging in Britain, he met and married a British lady and upon demobilization, after serving and surviving throughout Europe, learned that both his wife and their son had been killed by German bombers while he was in Europe. Such is the brutality of war, lest we forget.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding community volunteer from my riding of Clayton Park West. Mary-Evelyn Ternan has recently become the president of the Saint Mary's University Alumni Association. She has a long and proud history with Saint Mary's that began in 1968, the very year that Saint Mary's went co-ed.</p>
<p>After receiving her B.A. in 1969 and a B.Ed. in 1970, Mary-Evelyn began a successful career - a 33-year career, and a rewarding one, as a teacher in Halifax schools. She started at Central Spryfield School, and at the end of her career, she was on the staff at the new Park West School when it opened its doors. She settled the students in for the first few years of that school. I've known children who were in her class and have spoken of her and loved her very much. During her career, she took a sabbatical to earn a Master's in Education in 1988; that was also from her alma mater, Saint Mary's.</p>
<p>She is a personal friend and has been very involved in political life as well. I wish her all the best in this year as president of the Alumni Association of Saint Mary's.</p></speech>

I am pleased to say that as of two weeks ago, over one million mink were processed through the facility at the 340 Co-op and effectively last weekend we were 180,000 ahead of what we have ever seen in record numbers for that industry.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the minister for all the work and the support that he has put into making the summer a little bit more bearable for the people who participate in that industry, and I look forward to attending their AGM on November 13<sup>th</sup> and celebrating the success of an industry that struggled and lived through hard times and hopefully is going to prosper and grow in the future.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a pleasure to rise and speak about Bill No. 6 again today. We talked quite a bit about Bill No. 6 over the last few days. Bill No. 6 is a poor piece of legislation. There is a lot of disappointment on this side of the House with Bill No. 6 and a lot of disappointment amongst Nova Scotians about Bill No. 6, because Nova Scotians are looking to this government to suggest how the government is going to move the province forward. What is this government going to do to address some of the issues that the province is facing? One of the first things a government does is it says, we're not going to do this; we're not going to investigate this revenue stream; we're not interested in exploring new ways to turn the province around.</p>
<p>We don't want to do that. We're going to ban this. Then, Nova Scotians started to say, well, why are we banning this? Why can't we investigate it? The minister says, well, it's only a temporary ban. We are going to repeal it later on. Nova Scotians really don't know what to expect from this government. If you are a business and you're considering where you should operate, what projects you should follow, you look at Bill No. 6 and you say well, this is a government that is pretty unpredictable; I can't even understand this piece of legislation.</p>
<p>We don't want to confuse business. We want to be welcoming business. We want to be working with business and saying how can we work together for the betterment of the province? We're not seeing that with Bill No. 6. Bill No. 6 sends the message that we don't want onshore energy development. I know we have heard from the minister and he has talked about different projects that are going in different parts of the province and he says, well, that's enough. We don't need any more development. We have enough; we have offshore and we are looking at hydro, so we don't want any more - in a province with $15 billion worth of debt, in a province that had a deficit of $680 million last year and has a deficit of $300 million this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the ins and the outs don't balance. If you're going to be a government that stands up and says we are not interested in exploring any more new ins, then how do you make that equation balance? You have to cut the outs. So how is this government going to address the financial situation of this province when it won't consider new ways to generate revenue?</p>
<p>The really sad part of all this is the message that it sends to the rest of Canada, to the rest of the world, that Nova Scotia is a province that is not interested in helping itself. Nova Scotia is a province that won't do its homework. If you look at the Department of Energy's website, on their own website, in the questions and answers, there's a question there. It says, can fracking be done safely? That's the question on the Department of Energy's own website. The answer is that while fracking has been done safely in many instances, there have been examples where it has gone wrong, where the regulations haven't been followed or the exploration hasn't been properly monitored.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I take that to mean that if you have good regulation and you properly monitor things, fracking can be done safely. So this is a province that has no interest in developing proper regulations, has no interest in properly monitoring activities and making sure that things are done safely. Instead, we have a government that says we are not going to look at that.</p>
<p>We're not in a position to be saying we're not going to look at things. We don't have enough money to properly keep our infrastructure in place. We have roads all across the province that need work. This morning a member tabled a petition about a road in his constituency that needs to be rebuilt, redone. He said in his petition that the standard of that road is hurting industry. I think he said Agriculture and Fisheries and Aquaculture use that road, rely on that road, and the road is terrible. The road is damaging our own snowplows, I think he said.</p>
<p>We don't have the money to fix the roads, we don't have the money to properly care for our seniors, and yet we don't want to look for ways to help ourselves. Mr. Speaker, I am getting so worn down by standing up and talking to this government about the bad legislation that they put before this House. They put legislation before this House that doesn't help Nova Scotians, that tries to corner Nova Scotians into supporting things that aren't good for them.</p>
<p>I hope this House, this government, calls Bill No. 60 before this House. I would love to stand up and talk for hours on Bill No. 60, about how Bill No. 60 is bad for Nova Scotians, is bad for our youth, and is a bad piece of legislation. Bill No. 6 is the same thing. What we saw with Bill No. 1 is a government that will take some good things - you know, I'm optimistic. I'm hopeful that the government will properly execute the amalgamation of the health authorities, and maybe that will save money. I support good ideas, and that's a good idea, but in the same bill they include a bunch of other stuff around the unions that should have been separated out and properly debated. They put everything in one bill and say, take this.</p>
<p>Then we have Bill No. 6, where the government hasn't done its homework, hasn't talked to people, hasn't talked to industry, and they try to ram it through with their majority government. Then we see Bill No. 60, which is the culmination. It's the cherry on top. It's a combination of a bunch of things into one bill with proof that the homework hasn't been done on other issues.</p>
<p>So I would love to stand up and talk about Bill No. 60, and I hope I get a chance to do that today, but Bill No. 6 on its own is a bad piece of legislation. The government should be doing its homework. The government should be innovating, trying to come up with new ideas.</p>
<p>I have more to say on Bill No. 6, Mr. Speaker, but given the time right now, I would move to adjourn debate on Bill No. 6, and move into Oral Question Period. Thank you.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. In August of this year, the Minister of Health and Wellness was on a radio station in Bridgewater and he said, "I'm very concerned about the youth of our province that can see the e-cigarette as an entry into an addiction of nicotine and you know nicotine it's very, very difficult once you're addicted to break the addiction."</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the Minister of Health and Wellness explain the logic of cracking down on non-tobacco products while he is turning a blind eye to products he himself has admitted to be very, very difficult to quit once you've become addicted?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time to enlighten the House and Nova Scotians as to what the other two Parties failed to do. I'm tabling a piece of Hansard which has the NDP posing the following question to the Progressive Conservatives:</p>
<p>"I'll table a letter obtained through Freedom of Information in which the Minister of Health Promotion and Protection indicates that he does endorse a ban, the Federal Government indicates it also endorses a ban. If everyone agrees it's such a great idea, why won't the Minister of Health Promotion ban it himself?"</p>
<p>That exchange was in 2008. Both Parties on the other side were aware, knew this was an issue, they both did nothing. This government will have a ban on flavoured tobacco.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, nobody is fooled by the pathetic attempts of the Minister of Health and Wellness to deflect from the failure of his flawed legislation.</p>
<p>Back in December 13<sup>th</sup>, in the <i>New Glasgow News</i>, this minister told the public of Nova Scotia that e-cigarettes should be treated like tobacco. My question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, when is he going to start treating tobacco like tobacco?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#leo.glavine">
          <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite, former Minister of Health and Wellness. I took a look at the strategy they brought forward in 2011, it doesn't mention e-cigarettes; it doesn't mention flavoured tobacco; in fact, even worse, these two ministers never raised flavoured tobacco in four and a half years, in four and a half years (Interruptions)</p>

<p>The honourable Acting Leader of the New Democratic Party on her final supplementary.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I have a news flash for the Minister of Health and Wellness. He is now the person who is responsible for the health and well-being of people in this province and to go back to 2008 is just a cop-out and everybody here knows that.</p>
<p>We know that the Minister of Health and Wellness has some pretty interesting views on the health care system in Nova Scotia. He shared those with us in <i>The</i> <i>Advertiser </i>from Kings County shortly after he became Minister of Health and Wellness. In that article he chastised those who don't take the advice of their doctors, their nurses, and their nutritionists, to take more responsibility for wellness and their own health.</p>
<p>So my question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, why doesn't he take his own advice and start taking advice from the doctors and the nurses and the health care experts and providers in this province and ban flavoured tobacco now?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the former minister for reminding me, and all Nova Scotians, of how committed I am to the wellness of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The member opposite knows very well, as hard as we have taken the line on e-cigarettes, which is the best in Canada by the way, that won't happen until May 31<sup>st</sup> of next year, and by May 31<sup>st</sup> of next year our legislation will also include a ban on flavoured tobacco. And to finish, the Third Party has taken this as their flavour of the day.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, it's a lively Friday morning here in the House of Assembly. My question is for the Deputy Premier.</p>
<p>We now know that a dangerous offender has escaped from the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility in Dartmouth. This is at least the fifth escape in the last few years. On a previous occasion, the Liberal Justice Critic, now the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism said: "This most recent incident does nothing to inspire confidence that the system has improved." And went on to say: "There are security protocols that need to be reconsidered at this point and one would think the government would undertake whatever measures are at its disposal."</p>
<p>So my question to the Deputy Premier is, what security protocols have been improved in the last year to prevent this from happening under the Liberal Government's watch?</p></speech>

          <from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from>

I really hope that everybody in the House is listening and I hope that, because this is televised, the public is all listening.</p>
<p>I'm angry and I'm appalled that an offender has been released in error from our correctional facility. Something this severe should never be allowed to happen. The important thing right now is for people to understand this has happened - a press release has just been issued with the photo and information about the offender. We need to make sure the word gets out and police are investigating.</p></speech>

          <p>, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Minister of Justice for that answer and it's important that those things be clear, but my question was this: the Liberal Justice Critic, last time around, said it's important at that point that security protocols be improved, and all Nova Scotians are going to want to know how this happened under that minister's watch and I ask her, what improvements in the security protocols have been made under her watch to prevent this thing from happening in the first place?</p>

        <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>My new question is for the Deputy Premier. We now know, Mr. Speaker, this week that the call for bids on offshore exploration development has come up with a big zero. That's despite the fact that only two years ago we had bids totalling $2 billion for the right to explore and develop our offshore resources. Clearly the closed for business sign that the government has put up across our whole province with their ban on onshore gas is costing Nova Scotians in offshore opportunities now.</p>
<p>Will the Deputy Premier admit the obvious, that their policy of banning onshore development is now hurting our offshore as well?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#andrew.younger">
          <from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
          <p>Obviously I'm disappointed that there were no bids. As he would be aware, companies have indicated that it's because they felt it was a gas play and there are already 15 SDLs available. It's interesting to me that he thinks that we're closed for business, since Bear Head announced Friday that they were doubling production and the size of their project. Yesterday they announced that they are actually adding another 30 per cent to their application to the size of their project. Deep Panuke just the other day did a $450 million capital raise for projects here in Nova Scotia, and just this past week we had energy investors from around the world talking about what a great place Nova Scotia is to invest in energy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>The minister can't have it both ways. He's either disappointed or he's thrilled with what's going on. I don't know which it is. He said both.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, warm words aside, the bids were zero dollars. That is the problem. When he was an Opposition Critic, he had a lot to say about this very scenario. He said in this House, when we had previous bids of zero under the NDP, "What is your department doing either independently or in co-operation with the board to try and ensure that the parcels that are nominated are actually parcels that the industry is interested in bidding on?"</p>
<p>In other words, he wanted the NDP to do their job and make sure these bids attracted real dollars. Did he do his job, and if so, why did he fail so badly in this case?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, It's a good question. In fact, these parcels were established for bid before we were in government, so the first ones (Interruption)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an important question. It's a very important question, because exactly what I asked the previous government to do is a process that we already began for the first call for bids that we're involved in establishing the parcels for, and the nomination for those parcels closes on December 1<sup>st</sup> of this year.</p>
<p>I'm doing exactly what I called on the NDP to do previously. I am disappointed that there are zero bids on this, absolutely, like all Nova Scotians, but we are absolutely not closed for business. The recent investments in our offshore and onshore petroleum in the past few days alone prove that.</p></speech>

As the minister and her government are well aware, and all of us for that matter, there was a $52 million investment announced a week or so ago to help those most in need really, when we think about that.

          <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. Ever since coming into office as Minister of Community Services and Housing Nova Scotia, we have been quite proactive in establishing new and exciting partnerships with municipal governments, private sector and non-profit. There are new builds going up all over Nova Scotia, from one end of the province to the other, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity, different municipalities. The private sector has come to the table and actually engaged government in looking at housing. We currently house over 18,000 in the Province of Nova Scotia and I'm quite excited about the new builds, including the big one in HRM, which will be Bloomfield, which is absolutely on time and on track for opening in 2017.</p>

          <p>I thank the minister for her answer. I would, just further to that, ask - as far as I know we haven't anything slated for the area of Hants West that I represent and the numbers, actually, are quite staggering, how many there are waiting for affordable housing, unfortunately - is part of this $52 million investment also inclusive of rental supplements, I guess is the term that's used nowadays, for those on low income?</p>

        <speech by="#joanne.bernard">
          <from>MS. BERNARD</from>
          <p>Absolutely, in fact, $9.4 million of the $52 million that was announced last week will go directly to rent supplements, and what that will do will move approximately 500 people, or one-quarter of the wait-list, off the wait-list for affordable housing, so people who are low income or on income assistance who currently receive a shelter rate will have their rent supplemented, and that will be rolled out by December 1<sup>st</sup>. That is the fastest, most effective way to move people off a wait-list and get them into safe housing. That will be ongoing over the next couple of months, but we'll be starting December 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

In that report, the Chief Electoral Officer made recommendations to the House of Assembly regarding new legislative changes. Chief among them is a call for fixed-date elections.

CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, last week the College of Dental Hygienists called on the provincial government to create an oral health strategy to help promote oral health care. They are not alone in that call; the Nova Scotia Dental Association has been calling on the government of the day for action for a few years. Both represent a group of people that are experts in their fields. By encouraging first-tooth, first-visit practice, and allowing dental hygienists to operate and deliver services in community clinics, we could prevent hundreds of costly, unnecessary surgeries children undergo each year.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, has the minister spoken with representatives of these two groups and has he adopted their call for action?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the former Minister of Health raises a great question today. We know that unfortunately during the time of the NDP's time in office, with dental care, they pushed to get dental care over a wider part of our youth population. If they had actually consulted, there would have been greater direction towards the very area that the dental hygienists are now identifying, having provided a great report to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>When the House adjourns - whenever - then I will be meeting with that group. I think they're making some excellent points that can improve dental care in Nova Scotia.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>When the House adjourns, indeed. Chronic cavities can lead to early childhood caries, ECC, which may result in painful surgery for children. This is entirely preventable. Together, both organizations have concrete and relatively straightforward requests from the government to help better with the oral health of young children.</p>
<p>These hospital stays are preventable, painful and costly to both the parents and to the children. It is time Nova Scotians received more education and services to meet oral health care needs.</p>
<p>When can Nova Scotians expect movement from this government on the recommendations made by the Nova Scotia Dental Association and the College of Dental Hygienists?</p></speech>

We had to provide the IWK with another child dental surgeon, an anesthesiologist to support the program, especially when a lot of that serious work can be prevented by interventions early on. I have met with the Dental Association; I will meet with the hygienists after the House adjourns.

          <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. We were, in fact, all quite shocked to hear about a number of different allegations in the workplace. I would like to let Nova Scotians know that if they do feel that they are not being treated properly in their workplace, they can contact our Labour Standards line and we'll walk them through what the situation is.

Yesterday, we heard the minister speak about a number of initiatives the Public Service Commission is planning to implement. They plan to attract young people to the civil service while instituting a hiring freeze and a 1 per cent reduction in all departments. The cost of a new February holiday will impact departments a significant amount.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, how much will the holiday pay for civil servants cost Nova Scotia taxpayers?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#labi.kousoulis"><from>HON. LABI KOUSOULIS</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the member from across for the question. Nova Scotia has the least amount of holidays in Canada, and the provinces that have the most, Alberta and Saskatchewan, actually have the most booming economies in Canada. As well, in the Province of Nova Scotia, there is no hiring freeze. I don't know why the Opposition keeps thinking there is one.</p>
<p>As I said yesterday, the Public Service Commission has just recently, in the last few months, hired multiple new graduates from both university and college.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, they also have fracking in Alberta, so they can afford an extra holiday.</p>
<p>That wasn't my question; my question was the cost to the taxpayers. Small businesses are worried about the impact this holiday will have on them. They know exactly where the money will come from; it will come from their bottom line.</p>
<p>The government has to be honest about this as well. In September the Finance and Treasury Board Minister said departments were ordered to cut a further 1 per cent. She said in the coming year there would have to be some serious cuts and changes. My question, again, to the minister is, what services or programs will be cut as a result of the February holiday expenses?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#labi.kousoulis"><from>MR. KOUSOULIS</from><p>Mr. Speaker, if the Opposition knew the definition of fracking they would know we have that here, too, in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>There will be no services cut in the Province of Nova Scotia. We actually delayed the February holiday one year to allow small businesses to adjust for it. I've spoken with many small businesses and they welcome the holiday, they say that it will be good to have a break through the long winter.

<p class="hsd_center"><b>TIR: Winter Works Dispatchers - Downsizing</b></p></speech>
        <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal.</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that there are discussions beginning regarding the downsizing of winter work dispatchers who provide a great service during the winter months. Can the minister please confirm if the Department of TIR is, in fact, considering cutting winter works dispatchers?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, absolutely, positively not, in no way, shape, or form are we cutting anything. I know what the member is referring to. We have a serious issue with communications with respect to our winter maintenance for the most part, among other things the transportation that came out many times last year during a very difficult season. We have a dispatch and a calling system that simply isn't working for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>What we're doing is we're looking at a clear centre that is 24/7, that operates with professional people who take these calls, who know how to reroute traffic, who know how to make dispatch calls, who know how to reach out to those on the ground who are plowing our streets and making sure we're getting home safely. This is a good move, it's about efficiency, there's also a $400,000 cost saving and there will be no layoffs, no jobs impacted in any way, shape, or form.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#karla.macfarlane">
          <from>MS. MACFARLANE</from>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. I do have a letter here, which I will table because it is my understanding through this letter that 30 winter work dispatch bases will be downsized to 14, and as many as 48 positions could be affected. If this is true, can the minister please confirm if the new central dispatch operation, how many jobs it would create and actually how many job losses would be taken out of rural Nova Scotia?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we don't have dispatch depots. Dispatch is a function inside the current network of depots that we have, so this is a system that has become obsolete that we really have to create efficiency and effectiveness for the people of Nova Scotia. There aren't any job losses whatsoever. It affects 19 FTEs which will be entirely through attrition. There also will be 10 new employment positions there, so there's no hiring freeze in the Public Service right now, we're putting people to work and we're making sure we're doing good things for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>This is a question of efficiency - in addition to the $400,000 cost savings we're going to have a better dispatch so we can get the word out to Nova Scotians when the winter conditions hit our province.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse"><from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development.</p>
<p>A recent story in <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> tells the story of three women who made complaints about inappropriate behaviour towards them by the principal at the school where they work - and I will table that. The women say that the principal continues to work at the school and there doesn't appear to have been any repercussions for the principal's actions. Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the minister is, what process is in place to deal with allegations of sexual harassment in Nova Scotia schools and, in light of this story, does the minister feel this process is adequate?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#karen.casey"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you to the member for the question. The allegations obviously are serious. Any allegations are serious, and what's important is that there's a process in place so that those allegations can be investigated.</p>
<p>We do have a provincial code of conduct which covers all our staff and our students in our schools. Each board has their own code of conduct and we also have regional education officers who are in contact constantly with the board activities so anything that is untoward or that may need an investigation has a process it can go through.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse"><from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for her answer. One of the women who made a complaint said she is disturbed as much by the school board's response as she was by the incident of harassment.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, what action is the minister taking to create an environment where people in our school system have confidence their concerns about sexual harassment will be taken seriously and dealt with in an appropriate fashion?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#karen.casey">
          <from>MS. CASEY</from>
          <p>Mr. Speaker, again I would like to reassure all those people working in our school environment, whether it is our teachers or our principals or our students or our volunteers or any other staff who are there, if they feel they have been harassed in any way that there's a process to follow; there is a chain of command for them to go through. If, in fact, they feel they have not been satisfied with the response they get, there is also another contact for them.</p>

          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Community Services. The new February holiday will not only cost small business owners a significant amount of money but it will cost taxpayers as well. This is a cost we still do not know the extent of. People providing essential services across the province will need to work that day. People's needs do not stop just because the government has legislated a holiday.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister confirm that the new February holiday will not affect the level of staffing on provincial social workers and will she estimate what the extra costs associated with this staffing will be?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#joanne.bernard"><from>HON. JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>I can assure the member across the floor that the level of professionals who are in the Department of Community Services will not be affected by this holiday and he knows as well as I do that the work these social workers do every day protecting the most vulnerable in Nova Scotia is hard work and there's a large burnout sector within that level of front-line care in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>A February holiday will be a welcome addition and has been a welcome addition, based on comments from my staff about the February holiday.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell">
            <from>MR. ORRELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, no one in this House is disputing the important work that social workers do but it's also important that no one goes without services on those days. My question to the minister is, how will the minister make up the losses from her department as a result of this holiday? What services or programs may be impacted?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#joanne.bernard">
            <from>MS. BERNARD</from>
            <p>I just want to assure the member across the floor that services in the Department of Community Services don't stop because of a Saturday, a Sunday or a holiday. There is emergency care that happens 24/7, 365 days in this department and there will be no impact on those services so that the most vulnerable in our society will not see any interruption in service whatsoever.</p>

          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. The minister's briefing notes describe Phase 4 of Highway No. 101 and explain that land constraints through the Town of Windsor, along with the karst topography of the area, suggest that much of the construction will be a narrow median with a barrier.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, can the minister tell this House when the final design work for Phase 4 on Highway No. 101 through the Town of Windsor will be complete and whether the narrow median barrier will be considered?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>I would like to thank the member for the question. This is a conversation I've had many, many times with the member for Hants West about Highway No. 101, the Windsor corridor of the highway.</p>
<p>Basically first and foremost with respect to the barriers, it's truly an alignment issue. We don't have the space within that area, based on some of the challenges with geography, to put up the Jersey barrier. That's something that the member asked for many times and if we could do it and if it was that simple, it would be done by now.</p>
<p>We are looking at some of the short-term measures we can do. In terms of the long-term plan for Highway No. 101, we are working towards that. My understanding is that the final design isn't quite done at this point, based on those challenges with respect to the alignment, but we'll certainly work on that, and we'll get the member an update as soon as we can.</p></speech>

            <p>I'd like to thank the minister for that answer. Last December 24<sup>th</sup>, I attended a funeral of a Kings North constituent who died on this stretch of highway in a head-on collision, and with the winter now rapidly approaching, can the minister tell us if any of these short-term measures will be put in place before the onset of this winter?</p>

Obviously the TIR folks on the ground are looking at that, again, in conjunction with the many conversations we had here, so we'll certainly work towards that, and whatever we can get in place for the winter season along the Highway No. 101 stretch, we'll certainly do.</p>

            <from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from>
            <p>My question too, is for the Minister of TIR. Route 203 is a vital link for residents in southwestern Nova Scotia, and is in serious need of repaving. Last session, the minister said, "We certainly have made no commitment to make that a gravel road. We will do our best to do what the people want." I can table that. My question to the minister is, can he give us an update on the status of repaving this stretch of road?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>I thank the honourable member for the question. The reality is that we haven't ruled anything out officially. Based on the response from the members from all sides of the House, we are doing a very organic consultation with respect to the route. The reality is that it's an extremely, extremely expensive project. I think the number is in the range of about 40 kilometres, and it's very, very low volume, particularly in the middle of that section, so from our own statistics and our own engineering process, it doesn't fit paving.</p>
<p>That's without question, but we're still looking at the ways that we can somehow rehabilitate this road. We know it's important to the member. It's certainly important to the Minister of Natural Resources, and it's important to that region, so we're going to do our best to fix it up to make sure it's safe and passable for the residents in that area.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#sterling.belliveau"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>This road needs to be repaved and not left as just gravel, as it affects many residents. In the last session the minister said, "There are a number of MLAs who are affected by that road so we will listen, we'll consult, we'll get positive feedback and we'll make our decision from there."</p>
<p>My final question to the minister is, when does he plan on starting the public consultation on this particular road?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>The reality is, we know we need a plan for this road. It's certainly in great decay. Again, based on the metrics that we used, that we applied, that the previous government applied when that member was in Cabinet, these are the rules of the game, Mr. Speaker. This is what we apply to our processes. We don't want unsafe roads. If we're looking at strictly process and procedure here, that route would be a gravel road, based on our metrics, but obviously from the public's perspective, that's not acceptable at this point, so we're going to continue to have those conversations.</p>
<p>Obviously, as we continue to work toward our 2015 Local Roads' Capital Plan, we're going to take all those things into consideration. We're going to look at all the roads, and as usual, we are going to do our very best and make sure Nova Scotians are safe.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. In a previous Question Period in this session, I asked the Minister of Health and Wellness if he would come to the Northside General in Cape Breton and speak with health care workers about the closures of the ER, closures of the lab, and the state of the hospital in general. The minister committed to a meeting after this House sits. With the House getting close to drawing to a close, I wonder if the minister can update me on a specific date when he may come to the Northside General.</p>

I have plans to go to Cape Breton next week, looking at Thursday and Friday, possibly, of next week. It is primarily a fact-finding mission, as a big part of it. I've been in constant contact with the member for Victoria-The Lakes on the issues that concern her constituents, as well as the member who is from that area where the hospital is located. I know we'll have a very important trip to the area.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the answer, minister. The people of the Northside are very concerned about rumors around the closure of the Northside General and turning it into a nursing home. The minister just talked about the importance of the constituents in that area of the hospital, and I wonder if the minister will commit to having a public meeting and giving an update to the community on exactly where the plans are for the Northside General, the emergency room, the lab, and if it's slated to be closed or not.</p>

We will meet with certainly the clinical stakeholders at Northside, community people for sure. I know there is a lot of concern that has arisen there, not unlike some other hospitals that are about 40, 45 beds where some changes have been made, but what I can assure the member opposite and what he can quote in the media back home is there are no plans for closing Northside General Hospital.</p>

          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise again and speak to this bill. This bill is really a symptom of the issue that we have with this government. This government continues to put bad legislation before this House, tries to use their majority to ram it through with late hours, sit until 12:00 midnight, sitting all night trying to push bills through this House so they can fix them later.</p>
<p>We already have Bill No. 6 here. The minister has already acknowledged in the media that he's going to adjust this bill. He's putting a ban in place here and he's going to adjust it later.</p>
<p>Then we see Bill No. 60, which the Minister of Health and Wellness admitted to this House is a flawed bill and he said he will fix it later. Well, maybe we can stay here until midnight tonight debating Bill No. 60 so the government can use their majority and try to push it through so they can fix it later. We're going to see the same thing with Bill No. 6. We see it with every bill this government puts forth. We have Bill No. 51 before this House - same thing, we're going to fix it later, we're going to clean it up later.</p>
<p>When we put legislation through it sends a message about what this province, what this government, is all about. With Bill No. 6, the message is very clear. The message is very clear to business, the message is very clear to the rest of Canada, that this is a government that will stumble along, make mistakes, try to fix them later, but they will not stop. They will not stop and listen to Nova Scotians. They will not stop and stop in their tracks and say this is a mistake, we're going to get this right the first time. They have no interest in getting things right the first time, they are only interested in jamming things through this House and sending a message to industry that this is the way this government operates.</p>
<p>The minister can stand up and say that everything is great in the Department of Energy, everything is great with oil and gas exploration, we have all this offshore business, isn't everything wonderful? So let's not try to attract any more business to Nova Scotia because we have just enough.</p>
<p>Then what we find out, actually, Mr. Speaker, zero bids for zero dollars on the most recent block put up for bid. I wonder why - could it be a signal that companies are nervous about this government? They don't know what to expect. They are making decisions on how to allocate their capital, which projects to take forward, and there's a big question mark over any projects tied to this jurisdiction, a very big question mark - a ton of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if they pick up Bill No. 6, a one-page bill that closes the door on new ideas, closes the door on 1,500 possible jobs - we lost 9,000 jobs in this province - 1,500 jobs, the doors closed, not interested in looking at it - or are we? Who knows?</p>
<p>We're going to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing. We're going to prohibit it, but nobody knows what it is. I hope that somebody from the government side will stand up today and tell us how wonderful this bill is because they're not saying anything, Mr. Speaker. We've talked to this bill - I don't know how many different ways I can say it. (Interruption)</p></speech>

I hope somebody over there will stand up - when I take my place maybe somebody over there will stand up and say why this is a wonderful bill.</p>
<p>I think somebody will stand up and say this is a wonderful bill - is it going to happen today, Mr. Speaker? Do you think somebody might stand up and say, we're with the Minister of Energy on this one, for these reasons? Nobody stands up and talks to us.

          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Thank you. I'm just going to get to the good stuff, Mr. Speaker. Let me spend my last 10 minutes talking about the issues with Bill No. 6 and the message it sends. Bill No. 6 sends the message that we don't want onshore energy development in this province. There's no other message that could possibly be perceived from this bill, other than we don't want it.</p>
<p>Now why are we sending that message, Mr. Speaker? Are we sending that message because we have enough development in the offshore and we don't have time to focus on the onshore? Why are we sending a message that we don't want any more onshore energy investment? We have companies here exploring for coalbed methane and they're showing promising results, and now they need to finance those operations. If you are a company involved in onshore exploration in the Province of Nova Scotia and you go to possible investors and you say folks, I've got a great project here, it's in Nova Scotia, the first thing your possible investor is going to do is he's going to hand up a piece of paper and say, hold on, excuse me, isn't that the government that prohibits onshore development? How would you like to have that conversation take that U-turn on you, Mr. Speaker?</p>
<p>Do you think it's not harming investment in onshore exploration in Nova Scotia? It's a fool's game to think that you're not harming investment in onshore Nova Scotia, because you absolutely are; it's impossible to say otherwise. The Energy Department's own website says this decision will not impact investments. How in the world could the Department of Energy think that they have the authority to understand what might have happened, what a company might have been looking at doing? All of sudden the department says, well, we know that nobody was planning on doing investment here and so therefore it's not impacted. That's just silly.</p>
<p>That's the first thing Bill No. 6 does - it sends a message that we don't want onshore energy investment in this province. We don't want it. Why? Do we not need it? With $15 billion of debt, with roads that can't be fixed, with hospitals that can't staff emergency rooms, with seniors who need some financial assistance and need some help - we don't need to raise any more money? We're fine, we're good where we are? (Interruption)</p>
<p>We're hearing lots from the government side now and I really hope that when I take my place they stand up and speak to this bill. I hope that they have the courage to stand up and go on the record and tell me why they think this bill is great, because they're not saying too much about it.</p>
<p>The second thing Bill No. 6 does - Bill No. 6 ignores the sustainable development recommendations from the Wheeler report - absolutely ignores them. The Wheeler commission went around, they held meetings all around the province, they listened to Nova Scotians, they put their time and energy into developing a report which they gave to the minister who, after three days, decided he didn't need the report -it didn't matter what the report said, he's going to ban it.</p>
<p>The panellists from the Wheeler commission are coming out and saying, well, hold on a second, that's not what we said; that's not what our recommendation was. But it matters not to this government what anyone on the Wheeler commission says, it matters not what Nova Scotians say, it only matters what they want to do. What they want to do and they want to force this through and we're going to live with the ramifications of this. Nova Scotians have to live with the impact of Bill No. 6, Bill No. 60, Bill No. 51 - we can go on and on about the things that go on through this House and get pushed through and, meanwhile, what's happening to the lives of ordinary Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Is life getting better for ordinary Nova Scotians? Mr. Speaker, I wonder what you're seeing as you travel around and talk to people. People are struggling in this province and our government is saying we're not interested in looking at new ways of doing things; we're not interested in new opportunities; we are just fine where we are and we don't want to raise and revenues from our own accord.</p>
<p>Where would we be without the federal transfer payments we receive? Where would we be? One of the government members was telling me the other day that our debt to GDP is on par with that of Greece. What happened to Greece? If we didn't have the federal transfer payments coming in, where would we be? (Interruption) We can talk about whether that's a true statement about Greece or whether it's not a true statement, but the fact of the matter is this is not a rich province. We can haggle over details, but we are not a wealthy province. We are a province that is struggling. And where would we be if not for our neighbors in other provinces contributing to the transfer payment system and sending money to us?</p>
<p>We can say that we're not Greece or we're not whatever, but that doesn't make us better; it doesn't change our circumstances. What we need is an idea to change our circumstances. We need a government that says, okay, we accept the situation, but this is what we're going to do to change it. We don't see anything happening to better our circumstances, especially not with Bill No. 6.</p>
<p>Where is the wisdom? Where is the wisdom in saying, we have a thriving economy and we don't need to look at new ideas? I think that's what's happening here. We hear the minister talking about different projects, and I even hear some members from the back hollering out about $2 billion investments in the offshore and all this type of stuff. So are we fine?</p>
<p>I would love to take those members with me to talk to Nova Scotians about why everything is just great in this province and we don't need to even consider any new ideas. We don't even need to think about it. We get the Wheeler report, and within three days we say no, we're good, thank you very much, we don't need to look at any new ways, we're good right here where we are.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not feeling good where we're at. I'm pretty concerned about where this province is. As much as it thrills me and honours me to know that the members opposite are reading my blog that I post, I just hope they take a little bit of guidance from it. Maybe they might find a little nugget of something in there that they want to pursue.</p>
<p>I was saying last night that if you look at every great company, somewhere in there a decision was made early on by a courageous person to take that company forward. I would love to see a courageous decision from this government, because so far what we're seeing is that this government will take legislation from other areas and try to ram it through this House without thinking about the impact on Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>With those few words, I will take my place. Thank you.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to again rise to address Bill No. 6, which I think is a very faulty bill. When I think about what we've done this past year in this Legislature, I believe that five or maybe 10 years from now, when we look back or when the pundits look back, they will see that the two most significant pieces of business to come through this House will have been the bill to amalgamate the district health authorities and this bill.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate, but I believe this bill is very significant for the future of our province. If I think about the two bills, I think, well, you had a mandate to do the district health authorities bill, the government did it in significant opposition - significant support too, but a controversial bill. You showed a great deal of courage to do that bill, I believe, and as you know, we supported that bill. That was in our mandate to do it. How that will all turn out for the amalgamation of the district health authorities remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But I believe this bill is a very short-sighted bill that will be seen in the future to have been a bill that lacked courage and did not take the province in the direction it needed to go, for all the reasons that have already been stated.</p>
<p>If I think about issues that I have with this bill, for one thing, it's a very short bill. A one-page bill over something this significant to our province is kind of mindboggling to me. I compare it in my mind to the bill to amalgamate the Maritime Provinces Harness Racing Commission Act. That was a two-page bill, double the amount of content that this bill had. I realize they are different things, and there are some constituents for whom the Maritime Provinces Harness Racing Commission Act is very significant, but to me this is a much more significant bill.</p>
<p>As we've already stated, there are a number of problems with the bill that have satisfied neither side of this debate on hydraulic fracturing in the province. What does it mean - high-volume has not been defined. Does that mean that medium-volume and low-volume hydraulic fracturing are permitted? The minister has not clarified that, has not clarified the meaning of high-volume. I understand that will supposedly be forthcoming. Another very, very significant issue with this bill is that it does not clarify issues such as sandstone. Is sandstone fracturing permitted? This is specific to shale. Who knew, but apparently there is hydraulic fracturing in sandstone.</p>
<p>Again, I would say this is a hastily conceived bill over an extraordinary subject to our province. I believe it is incumbent upon us as a province to take our role in the Canadian economy. We see the provinces that have embraced this new technology have succeeded.</p>
<p>Now, I believe we have many important industries in Nova Scotia that will, I hope, do well in the future, but this is a significant one in that it has the ability, to quote the Ivany report - the term, I know the Ivany report didn't quote this, but the term - this has a possibility to be a game-changer, this onshore hydraulic fracturing. I believe it's something that we as a province need to take a much more significant look at than a one-page bill with a moratorium.</p>
<p>We need in this province where we have so many people going out West to work in this industry. Every day, planeloads of people - and not just our young people; as I know many of you know, we have people who are in their 60s taking the red-eye out to Alberta and Saskatchewan to work. It's a very significant change in our province. I believe for those reasons it's something that we need to have a much more sustained looked at than a one-page bill.</p>
<p>I believe that this bill will have a chilling effect on industry. It sends a message about Nova Scotia to the industry across Canada, the resource-based industry, which is a very unfortunate message. I know that it's easy to say, well, this is just specific to one sector and that doesn't apply or matter for the other sectors. That's one way of looking at that.</p>
<p>But I know that in the farm community, even though I'm a vegetable farmer and a summer savory farmer, if something happens that affects mink farmers or dairy farmers, I'm aware of it. I think that's just the same way as in the resource industry sectors. The messages that government sends are heard far broader than just the specific sector, and the closed-for-business message that this bill sends to industry across Canada has to be considered. I know that it's not possible to define that, but you have to wonder about that when you look at the bid situation for offshore that just happened. Is that industry sending a signal?</p>
<p>One of the things that I think you have to appreciate - in my business, Farmer John's Herbs, we've had the opportunity to deal with these very big companies like - and I don't know if I should mention them, but - the huge grocery chains. I only ever interacted at a very, very low level in that chain, but significant - the buyers - and even in international chains in this country and the buyers in that. I had the opportunity to even go into the head office of Walmart in Toronto, for example.</p>
<p>When you go in to deal with those people at that level, you have to appreciate just how much pressure they're under. There they are; they want you to make this simple, straightforward and quick. One of those people in that position would be dealing with 70, 80 or 90 emails a day, all of them important. Maybe a couple hundred text messages a day, all of them important. There would be voicemail messages every day. The amount of stress and pressure they are under in the retail grocery sector is just kind of mind-boggling.</p>
<p>I would suggest to you that that exists in the resource sector, too, that those individuals across the country, who are making these decisions on where they should invest their money, are all under this kind of pressure, which is really an unbelievable amount of pressure in those high-level positions in these resource sector companies. That is why I say that small signals have a big effect on them. That's why I believe it's very unfortunate that this bill has the term "moratorium" in it. It sends a very negative signal.</p>
<p>These individuals who are doing this type of investment just don't have time to fool around with jurisdictions that don't want to do business with them. They take that signal and they go off in another direction. You may appreciate that in a country like Canada, for a resource-based company, there are opportunities in many different places. For them to decide well, we'll go and work - if they have the signal that they are not welcome in Nova Scotia, they are taking that signal.</p>
<p>I believe there is a very significant negative part of this bill that is sending the signal to the resource sector industry across the nation that we are closed for business. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned there are, I believe, very big gaps in what this should say. If you think about - as I mentioned previously - the environmental side of this, those who would have no hydraulic fracturing in the province are not happy with this either as there are big gaps in what this legislation permits and doesn't permit.</p>
<p>As I said, I believe the fact that it's a moratorium on hydraulic fracking will have a chilling effect on investment in the province, even though I know the minister has indicated that there will be types of hydraulic fracking that will be permitted. I understand coal bed hydraulic fracking is one of them.</p>
<p>I just think that this is a very, very unfortunate bill. I believe it will be the signature bill. Along with the DHAs Act, this was the signature bill of this sitting of the Legislature, probably this past year; a bill that is closing down our province for investment in the resource sector generally, I think, not only in the oil and gas sector; a bill that is telling our hard-working citizens who are going out West that you had better start thinking about moving your family out there because nothing is happening here any time soon.</p>
<p>It is a bill that is telling our young people who are studying pipefitting and petroleum engineering and all those things, well you had better start thinking about going out West. That whole trend has been a very disturbing trend and it has even reached into my neighbourhood. I just think of a week and a half ago when I was here for the Canadian Parliamentary Association and the Speaker of the House in Saskatchewan said to me, you know what John? We don't mind when we have the head of a family coming out to Saskatchewan to work because we know that after about a year of that they're going to get tired of that and the wife is going to say, are you married to me or what? She is going to say they are going to make a decision as a family to move out there.</p>
<p>We see that happening. People can only tolerate this long-distance work setup for so long, some of them, anyway; some people have tolerated it for a remarkably long time but a lot of people can tolerate it for only a certain amount of time, when the stress on the family becomes too large and they make that decision to move right out West. This is what we are seeing.</p>
<p>It's this industry that is pulling them out there, hydraulic fracturing. It is an opportunity. I mean, go figure, according to the Wheeler report we have the opportunity to do this in Nova Scotia. It is predicted that there is - and I realize this is uncertain, but with a moratorium we'll likely never know - it is predicted that in one of the basins there's 69 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It is an opportunity that is there waiting for this government to go forward with.</p>
<p>I say it's still not too late for this government to change its mind on this. I think that just as the government clearly showed a lot of courage in the Health Authorities Act that went forward against considerable opposition, but I believe pursued what, in fact, was the right thing to do, I think you can do it again on this bill too. I would encourage you to think about that. It is something that would take courage to go forward but simply just adopting the Wheeler commission recommendation on Page 5 to go slow would be the right thing to do, to go forward slowly.</p>
<p>I heard the minister mention in the House about lawsuits in Alberta and I want to talk about lawsuits. There are apparently 15 million Americans who live within one mile of a natural gas well, a fracked well, and in America that has triggered in, 2012, 1,000 complaints. If you think about that, that's fairly significant and I don't want to minimize that. If you have an industry it's very possible that there are participants, as there are in every industry, there are participants who don't follow the rules; it's very possible there are companies that are not good corporate citizens.</p>
<p>There may well be, it's highly likely, in fact I would say there are a certain amount of these lawsuits that are entirely legitimate for companies that did not follow the rules. There's also another category of a situation where there's simply an accident which triggers a lawsuit or something that happened accidently or, in fact, an accident. There would probably be a certain number of these that would be, as my friend in Alberta said, the politics of envy where someone thinks I'm not participating in the wealth coming from this but maybe I can say that I got - maybe the cow died and I can say I think it's because of this and take the oil and gas company to court.</p>
<p>I know from my time on the board of directors of the Kings Mutual Insurance Company that there are many lawsuits happening all the time for many reasons, and for a government to suggest that the reason they will not permit hydraulic fracturing is because of lawsuits in Alberta, I don't believe is a credible argument.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger">
            <from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
            <p>I never said that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. LOHR</from><p>I thought you did say that, sorry.</p>
<p>I realize the minster is replying back to me, but in fact that's what I thought I heard and if that was not correct, I apologize to the minister.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest to the minister that I have a constituent in Kings North who has a lawsuit right now, this government - and we brought this issue to the floor - is pursuing against my constituent. I don't think that the Province of Alberta would come and look at the department of social services and think, well, they're doing a lawsuit, so that tells us something about our policy. I would hope that the fact that there are lawsuits in other jurisdictions does not necessarily inform this government's policy on this issue.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, as I would say from a - if we look at the oil and gas industry that we have in Nova Scotia right now the oil delivery, the furnace oil delivery truck is a very familiar sight in our province. I can tell you that all of the above-ground effects that the Wheeler commission suggests could happen with fracking probably are happening right now with the oil delivery guy. I had a constituent in Kings North who had a full barrel of oil in her basement and had the oil delivery guy come on a routine stop and put in double the amount of fuel needed in that tank and that all filled her basement. That triggered - fortunately it was not on the books of Kings Mutual but that triggered a good $500,000 worth of damage and I'm sure her insurance company did something called subrogation, where they would take that issue to court and get the oil delivery liability insurance to pay for that.</p>
<p>All the time there are lawsuits happening, and that's just our society's way of sorting out differences. As I said, apparently in 2012 with 15 million Americans living within one mile of a fracked natural gas well, there were 1,000 complaints. At the same time, in 2014, apparently across the United States there were 300,000 civil lawsuits. We know that in that country there's a lot of litigation happening all the time and actually the ratio for 15 million to 1,000 is less than probably the ratio of nearly 400,000 lawsuits in a country of 350 million. I would suggest it is just about on par with the average there on that. The fact that there are lawsuits happening is, I believe, not a reason. I understand the minister just said that, but that's not a reason for us to not look at this.</p>
<p>The Wheeler report, which says go forward slowly, lists a number of different hazards with hydraulic fracturing. I think it's instructive to talk about what these hazards are. I don't believe that in the public mind, the public has these hazards really accurately understood. The term "fracturing" refers to what happens down underground, 1,000 metres or more underground.</p>
<p>This is one area where, in fact, legislation would be very useful - to define how shallow or how deep hydraulic fracturing could happen. I understand that has been an issue in Alberta, where sometimes hydraulic fracturing has happened in very, very shallow circumstances. That would be one area where I would hope the minister would provide guidance to the industry here. If we think about - I know in our area, if you have a well that is more than 600 feet deep, you went pretty deep. In our area, we can tap into the aquifer, which is a fantastic aquifer in the Annapolis Valley with very, very substantial and very useful water within 200 feet. We can tap into that.</p>
<p>In many cases, the fracking is happening as far down as 10,000 metres, which is 30,000 feet, in Saskatchewan and Alberta. But certainly we would want to see that at, I would say, nothing less than 1,000 metres, which is 3,000 feet, which is substantially down below the level of the water table.</p>
<p>What the Wheeler report lists as the risks associated with fracking that are underground - there are two risks. Both are listed as rare, and I think that with over 100,000 wells fracked in Canada, to my knowledge, no incidents, maybe we could even say exceedingly rare that the well bore would leak or that there would be, in the horizontal aspect of the fracture, a leak up through. Both of these are listed as exceedingly rare and, certainly with well integrity, are relatively easily to deal with.</p>
<p>However, the Wheeler commission report goes on to list 16 or 17 different circumstances that can happen above ground, all of them listed as certain to happen. Even though the public, I think in their imagination will believe that this is all underground, the issues are actually above ground. Not to be minimized, I believe (Interruptions) No, I'm not arguing that. Not to be minimized, I believe that all of these things need to be the subject of good regulation, which is part of going forward slowly as the Wheeler commission has said, not a moratorium - or as the Wheeler commission said, a political device. I called it a moratorium.</p>
<p>I believe that we need to go forward slowly. We have the opportunity in this province to cherry-pick the legislation around the country - in fact across North America - and look at best practices and have the best legislation possible that is applicable to our circumstances. Maybe the geology of Saskatchewan or Alberta is not the same, I presume, as the geology of Nova Scotia. I'm quite positive it isn't actually. Maybe we're more similar to the geology of some of the New England States.</p>
<p>In fact, I had the opportunity a number of years ago of actually visiting a Saskatchewan potash mine. We went down below ground 1,000 feet, travelled horizontally for a couple of miles to the face of a potash mine. It was one of the most riveting tours I ever did. After we were out of that, I said, I think I should write them a letter and say, don't tour anybody down there, it's not safe. It was fascinating, but as I know this House knows, Saskatchewan has a huge area that is an ancient seafloor down 1,000 feet. It's very salty. It's under that that this oil and shale that they are able to export is.</p>
<p>So as I was saying, there are a number of effects listed that are above-ground effects. I believe that all of these, including the below-ground effects and the above-ground effects, need to be the subject of legislation. But in fact, when you look at the above-ground effects, by and large, they are the same above-ground effects that would happen with our diesel fuel industry, our furnace oil industry, all of the gas industry certainly, I'm sure that most of them would be similar to the compressed natural gas industry - all of the other things that we accept.</p>
<p>What are those above-ground effects? They are increased traffic in rural areas damaging the roads when maybe the infrastructure to allow an industry like that to come in is not adequate. That's certainly happened. There's friction because of that increased traffic. Local people don't like that increased traffic. That's an issue that has to be dealt with. There are social issues where suddenly there's newfound wealth in someone's hand and not in another. That is an issue.</p>
<p>There is the whole issue of the storage and containment and treatment of the fracking waste water. I do believe that there are ways of dealing with that. Certainly it can be dealt with better than it has been. This should not just be left in a tailings pond for years. We can have better regulations than we've had, the way that we've dealt with it up until now. I believe that there are ways that we can go forward with that and that needs to be studied, but that is all part of that go-forward-slowly equation that we need to be thinking about as a province.</p>
<p>The Wheeler report addresses it again. Below-ground, one of the issues, one of the things people fear, is that their well water will be impacted by natural gas. The Wheeler report states that this is not a legitimate fear. We know from the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of wells in North America now that have natural gas naturally occurring within them that have nothing to do with any oil and gas industry effect, that it just happens.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to see a really interesting video of one of those water wells that has the effect of being able to have a match lit to it, you just have to look at Josh Fox's video, because that effect was present at that well before there was ever any hydraulic fracturing in that community. When he was challenged on that, he said he was aware of that, but it wasn't relevant. How that wasn't relevant is a mystery to me, because that was the compelling point of triggering public fear, but in fact that was naturally-occurring gas in that area. There are apparently hundreds of thousands of places across North America where this occurs, so it was not related to the hydraulic fracturing that had occurred in that area. It was a very unfortunate piece of misinformation that was very well used by the documentary maker and it was really unfortunate.</p>
<p>One of the comments the minister had made in passing was that the Wheeler report mentioned effects on agriculture. I studied the Wheeler report quite carefully to see those effects. There were comments made by presenters to the - one of them, I believe, by a woodlot owner - and previously in the House, I drilled down into the statistics of agriculture in Pennsylvania and North Dakota between 2007 and 2012. I was able to show that in nearly every significant agricultural statistic, those two states had seen an increase to the positive, including total acres of farms, gross sales and land value. Land value in North Dakota had doubled between 2007 and 2012.</p>
<p>The agricultural economy tracks a little bit differently than the regular economy. If you think about what happened in 2008 in the United States, there was a huge decrease in property values. I don't even think that you could say that by 2012, it had fully recovered. For agricultural land to have doubled in value in a state in that time, shows clearly that whatever happened in that state, there was no detrimental effect to the agriculture industry that could be attributed to hydraulic fracturing in the state.</p>
<p>We could have looked at other states that did not have that. Some of them, not all of them, had positive growth and those two states did. I speculated at the time that probably if farmers have a little bit more money in their pocket, one of the things they do is they invest in the productive assists of the farm. That would be one of the explanations that little bit more money in the rural economies would trigger farmers to grow a little bit more crop.</p>
<p>Another factor that happened was simply the rise in the value of some of the grains in that 2007 to 2012 period across the globe. One of the things that we know in the agriculture community is that while it's quite academic for us if bread goes from $2.49 to $2.99, the price in the grocery store, in fact, in that time frame, the Arab Spring was probably triggered by the increase in the cost of wheat and grains across the globe. That was probably a factor in all of those states - the rebound - and I think that if I had been able to draw up that data, you could have said the same thing for Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p>
<p>Certainly we saw that here in Nova Scotia down in the Annapolis Valley that the increase in the price of soya beans actually had a factor in land prices increasing in the Annapolis Valley. Those are the effects that you can have but I say that to show that despite the fact that the Wheeler report makes a passing reference, where someone made a comment, I do not believe that the USDA Agriculture statistics bear that out that, in fact, there was a negative impact on agriculture in Pennsylvania and in North Dakota.</p>
<p>That's not to say that, again going back to the Wheeler report's analysis of surface effects that there weren't some companies that are simply bad actors that shouldn't be there that didn't do things. There certainly are local effects, or there aren't accidents or there aren't things that happen. That's just life. Stuff like that does happen and those things can be dealt with through the judicial system and there is recognition of that.</p>
<p>We accept those types of risks all the time. Anytime you get on the highway you are accepting a certain amount of risk that you could be in an accident and you could have a legal effect, or when you get on an airplane you are accepting the fact that there could be somebody who could make a mistake putting fuel in the tank and maybe your airplane is going to run out of fuel.</p>
<p>Industry is always struggling to try to provide a higher level of safety and that is where government and regulations come in, and not the government saying no to a sector like this, which I think is extremely unfortunate. It is the role of government to provide the regulatory framework that provides a clear path forward for these industries to go ahead. That is why I think this is such an unfortunate bill because it slams a door on it, sends a signal to resource industries across Canada about the attitude of the government here in Nova Scotia and is not the right way forward.</p>
<p>It's the role of government to do the hard work - as I will say I see that you are doing in the Health Authorities Act - to do that hard work to try and get it right and to go forward. As I said, I believe this will end up being one of the two hallmark bills of this sitting that will be remembered and it is very unfortunate that a one-page, hastily conceived bill will be that bill.</p>
<p>I talked previously about my friends across Canada. One of the things that I have had the privilege of doing is being involved in an international agriculture association, which was set up in 1950 in the U.K. by Lord Nuffield, who was William Morris, maker of the Morris Car. He was the Henry Ford of England. He believed that communism in 1950 was going to take over the world. He was vastly wealthy and created a huge number of endowments. If you Google that word Nuffield, you won't find our Canadian Nuffield agriculture association simply because it is buried in so many hits of so many different things in the U.K. and around the world.</p>
<p>One of the things he did was create the opportunity, in the beginning, for people from the Commonwealth to go to the U.K. and study farming. One of the early adopters, who I know the member for Kings West would know, Fred Walsh, who I believe was a Nuffield Scholar in 1961 - and actually, he was the reason that I did this program, too. Fred was the instigator for triggering me to do it in 1997-98.</p>
<p>In the course of doing that international study, which I did in the U.K. and France and Germany and Holland, what I never expected was the ongoing relationship I would have with farmers across Canada who are participants in this charity, this agricultural scholarship. One of the results of that was that I came to know different farmers across the country on a personal basis, and not necessarily exactly in my sector either. We always tend to know the people in our own sector better. But that has been a privilege.</p>
<p>I mention that because I was able to call my friends across the prairies about fracking in their provinces, and was there any agricultural impact in their province? I want to just again briefly mention my three farmers who I did call. One was in southern Ontario, and he had a used gas well on his farm - he actually had a couple. They were from the 1950s, and they did not provide an economic amount of natural gas, and they actually were - in fact, one of them was abandoned. He said to me, John, we had the liability so we thought we might as well have the benefit. So even though there was a very small amount of natural gas coming out of those wells, he was able to heat - since the 1950s or 1960s, when they set it up, until this day they've been able to heat two homes, two barns, and a shed every winter, and run their grain dryer in the summer.</p>
<p>It's easy to conceive that that would be, I'm sure, in the $30,000 or $40,000 worth of fuel every year from a gas well that no longer provided an economic amount of gas. So if and when we ever go forward with this hydraulic fracturing, I believe that the opportunity to have the landowner acquire the well after it no longer provides an economic amount of gas is something we should consider, or we should try and make provision for that, because it can be enormously valuable if these wells continue to provide gas.</p>
<p>One of the issues that Jack had in Blenheim, southern Ontario, was that their well had not produced as much. It was slowly declining, and they had to have it rejuvenated in a process that sounded a lot like fracturing to me, but they did successfully do that a couple of years ago. His area has a lot of these natural gas wells. He said there are other landowners who have access to them, too. I don't know how common it is, but certainly agriculture and natural gas in southern Ontario co-exist very nicely. He's farming some of the most valuable land in Canada.</p>
<p>One of the things he told me, he said, John, land has never given back in terms of what you could productively make off it. It has never been enough to pay for the land, but everyone who has ever bought it was able to sell it for more than they paid for it, and they always made money on it. This is in southern Ontario, again, in some of the most productive land in Canada.</p>
<p>I called my friend in Saskatchewan, who told me, when I did call him - this was shortly after Thanksgiving; actually, I think it was Thanksgiving night - they were just having their supper after having driven a combine all day. He was working for his neighbour, who had a 30,000-acre farm. He said that as far as he knew there was no negative impact from hydraulic fracturing in the farm community, and this from a farmer who is now retired. Ian McFadden is his name, very well-known in Saskatchewan. Again, when we had the CPA here, the Saskatchewan members, I said, I am a friend of Ian McFadden, and the members of the Assembly of Saskatchewan knew this guy. He's very well-known and very well-connected in the agricultural community in Saskatchewan, and would know what was going on in that province.</p>
<p>Finally I talked to my buddy from Alberta, who I did not realize was actually farming on a very intensely fracked piece of ground. He had a vegetable farm. He had 1,000 acres of vegetable land in Innisfail, Alberta, and I believe he told me he had 15 wells on that farm, which each take up about four acres. So his farm, the land that he was farming, was completely hydraulically fracked underneath. He didn't tell me the actual numbers of what he got for income, but I can tell you it was a very nice income stream. He said he was making anywhere from $900 to $2,500 an acre in royalty, you can imagine if you multiply that by 60, so he was making anywhere from a low of - if you gave me that range, then I wouldn't doubt that it was close to $100,000 a year income stream on this 1,000-acre farm. A very, very significant income stream for him.</p>
<p>I said, Rod, is there any impact? He said, well, they run pipelines under the ground and those become de facto rights-of-way, you can't build over top of them. He had some issues with these small pipes underneath his soil, meaning he could not build a barn in a certain area. But on a 1,000-acre farm, I'm sure you can appreciate there are places to find to build &#x2026;</p></speech>

            <from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
            <p>How many 1,000-acre farms are there in Nova Scotia?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. LOHR</from><p>There are quite a few. In response to the minister's question, I will tell the minister that we have, in Nova Scotia, which I realize spreads out over more than just Nova Scotia, in fact, the largest fruit farm in the world would be the Bragg Lumber operation which I believe covers 50,000 acres and is in fact the largest fruit farm in the world.</p>
<p>We do have a significant amount of agriculture in Nova Scotia and I don't have the statistics on how many 1,000-acre farms there are, but I can tell you in Alberta there are many farms that are larger. Nevertheless, my friend Rod Bradshaw's farm would count as a completely hydraulically fracked farm. He did tell me there were a couple of other effects associated with that - one was that these guys made excellent roads so he had very good roads on his farm and, obviously, the income stream.</p>
<p>I asked Rod about the general effect in the neighbourhood and he was the one who first mentioned to me what he called the politics of envy, where there seemed to be in that area some lawsuits just triggered by envy. Going back to my days with Kings Mutual Insurance I can tell you there is an astounding number of ways, mysterious ways that a cow can die and it seemed like every time we had a board meeting we were discussing strange new ways cows died. There would always be the possibility of someone trying to associate something negative that happened on their farm with the fact that there was hydraulic fracking in the area, which would be subject to debate.</p>
<p>One other thing that we know is that big oil companies don't fare well in jury situations, so lots of times they do payouts and it can't be taken as a sign that they saw that as a sign that they were guilty, it's just that they're playing the odds on that and figuring a payout is going to cost "x", defending is going to cost "x-plus 2" and our odds of winning are not even 50-50, so that's kind of the way these big oil companies look at these lawsuits.</p>
<p>Those are some of the effects in agriculture, the idea that the Wheeler report references agriculture is true, but it is simply a statement that is made by a presenter and is not presented in fact, not drilled down to in terms of rigorous research. I realize I didn't provide that either; I provided anecdotal research and simply looked at the raw statistics of two states, I realize that doesn't actually qualify for rigorous research, but I will say I think it is a little more in-depth than the anecdotal statements that are made in the Wheeler report. The whole area is something that would need to be subject to a little bit more rigorous research at that. I think it would be.</p>
<p>I think of the constituent I met who said, John, Nova Scotia can't regulate anything and we should just not even have anything to do with defending the moratorium that your government is presenting here. I don't believe there's actually - I think there's evidence to the contrary. I think we regulate many things very successfully as a government, but there is a crisis of public confidence in the government. I think that's true. If you think about the way we regulate the handling of garbage in this province, we are world class at regulating the way recyclables and garbage is handled. We can be justly very proud of that.</p>
<p>There are many other areas that this government regulates very effectively, and the idea that we are incapable of regulating something - I believe this constituent's statement is a fallacy and should not be taken as how things are doing. The reason I say that is, in my opinion, the government is baling out on regulating this industry. This is an easy way out, to put a moratorium on it and say, forget about it. It's just a huge mistake.</p>
<p>This industry is something that we desperately need in our province. It would be a game-changer if it went forward. It's not certain that it will go forward even if we provide the regulatory framework. That is all dependent upon what happens in the drilling phase, but the fact that it is potentially there, the fact that other provinces can see that Nova Scotia has the potential to try this and is baling out on it sends a negative statement across Canada about us as a government.</p>
<p>We see that British Columbia, and Alberta, and Saskatchewan have successfully done this, provided ongoing regulatory framework; that is something that we, as a Legislature, should be doing. The minister is, I believe, entirely misguided in this very short bill. It should be a bill providing a path forward that both satisfies the environmental concerns and provides a straightforward path forward for industry.</p>
<p>I believe, as the Wheeler report says, that we need to go slow. We have the opportunity to have world-class legislation in this, and we're bypassing that, and that's very, very unfortunate. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. LOHR</from><p>I do have. Where do I want to go from here? When I presented those agricultural statistics from Pennsylvania and from North Dakota, there was a little bit of disappointment that I hadn't mentioned cabbage, and I do have a couple of cabbage statistics from Pennsylvania, so I'll give you those right now: increase in production from 2007 to 2010 - I can't provide you with 2012 - but in that time frame from 2007 to 2012, cabbage production actually increased in Pennsylvania. So cabbage was (Interruption) Were you going to say something, Mr. Speaker? I heard someone say order - I'm sorry, that wasn't you. Even my buddy behind me is upset with this bill, if you look at his dire expression, so I know that (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the fact that we have the opportunity to have world-class legislation and I just wanted to talk briefly about legislation in other jurisdictions. I know this government is very fond of saying, you can find it on the website, but if you were to go to the websites of Saskatchewan and Alberta, you would find very extensive legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, and that legislation provides a framework for how the industry can go forward.</p>
<p>In fact, Saskatchewan is in the process right now of rewriting their legislation to what is called, results-based environmental legislation. It's not entirely clear to me what that means, but my point is that other jurisdictions in North America are grappling with how to provide a framework to put this legislation in effect. I think it's very clear that hydraulic fracturing has made an immense difference in North America.</p>
<p>I can tell you one difference it has made for the agricultural industry. Last year, in the Canadian prairies they had a record wheat crop, and one of the issues they had was that they were not able to get that wheat crop to market because the Canadian rails were not available because 20,000 - the amount of oil and gas being transported on the rail system in North America had just mushroomed.</p>
<p>One of the effects that we see of the whole fracking industry in North America is the fact that right now, we have declining oil and gas prices. Right now, if you think about what is happening in the globe, we should be looking at $150 to $200 a barrel oil by rights. Were it not for the change in the supply of unconventional oil and gas right now, I think it would be easy to say that we would be sitting in a situation with close to $200 a barrel gas with what is happening with ISIS in the Levant and the Middle East and what is happening in an area that we have traditionally relied on for oil and gas.</p>
<p>North America is nearly self-sufficient now. There has been a huge change. So rather than having $150 a barrel oil and gas right now, we have $70 a barrel oil and gas. If you look at what's happening in the Ukraine now, one of the dominant suppliers of oil and gas in the world is Russia. Were it not for the fact that we had our own domestic supply through this unconventional source, we would be at a turmoil in those countries - it is very unfortunate that that's going on there, but that turmoil would have pushed our prices through the roof.</p>
<p>Another thing that's happening - and again, this unconventional oil and gas and fracking has given us the opportunity to have natural gas. It is my belief that if we see in the future further development of natural gas, it is possible with the shutting down of coal plants or converting to natural gas that we could even get our salmon industry back, our salmon in our rivers. It's the sulphur content in the coal plants, in that coal, that has been giving us acid rain, and it's very clear that acid rain is the reason we no longer have salmon runs in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The possibility that natural gas will be there - and it's already happening in America. If we were to have natural gas here, the opportunity to use that in our coal-fired power plants would be very beneficial to the environment. Natural gas is a very, very clean-burning fuel. Many of you have been in hockey arenas throughout the province; often in those hockey arenas, you'll have a Zamboni powered by propane, which is a very close relative to natural gas. That unit burns so clean and if adjusted properly, which is a key factor, it burns so clean that you can run it in an arena full of people and have very little negative effect. Now if it's not adjusted properly, everyone will get a headache before too long.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity that natural gas gives us, which is an opportunity from fracking to get this unconventional gas, which is what is predicted to be here in Nova Scotia. We already see that industry in Nova Scotia, including our hospitals, are converting to compressed natural gas. So the interest in natural gas is huge.</p>
<p>The reason that interest is there is because of hydraulic fracturing, because that has provided North America with a very inexpensive source of natural gas. In fact, we see that the port facilities that were being built in North America to import compressed natural gas are now being set up to reverse that flow so we'll be able to export compressed natural gas. We went from having very little natural gas in North America, probably in 2006 or 2007, to now having the lowest prices in the globe for natural gas. We're having businesses like Michelin and Hostess Frito-Lay and our hospital and Acadia University in my area switching to compressed natural gas because of these very low prices, which is a benefit of hydraulic fracturing.</p>
<p>In fact, when I had a tour of the Acadia boiler plant that at that moment was being converted to - they already had part of it. As you can imagine in that big plant, they don't have just one big unit. They have, I think, three units so that they have a little bit of redundancy built in, so if there was a breakdown, the two units could cover for the one that wasn't working. They already had a couple of these units converted over to natural gas, and they discovered that even running them, they are 3 per cent more efficient, simply because natural gas doesn't put the same amount of soot in the air that the bunker C did, which was what they were running before, and that soot would cake the inside of that boiler unit and they would have to clean it out periodically. They estimated that alone was worth 3 per cent, let alone the maintenance.</p>
<p>The benefits of natural gas are huge. Our province is already in the process of switching to natural gas. We have the opportunity, if we were to go forward with hydraulic fracturing, if we were to change our mind on this, if the government were to take another look at this, we would have the opportunity to have our own made-in-Nova Scotia natural gas. It would mean that we could probably convert our coal plant to natural gas if we had enough. It would mean a cleaner environment. It would mean businesses like Acadia, Michelin and Pepsi - or Hostess Frito-Lay, which is Pepsi-Co, you understand - would be able to continue on with a low-cost fuel.</p>
<p>I hope that it means someday we will be able to have a pipeline in the Annapolis Valley. I think that one of the issues we have - and you could take this Wheeler report and overlay the issues right over top of the compressed natural gas industry and other than the two risks that are subsurface, you could probably take almost all those other risks and put them on compressed natural gas, other than the waste water risk.</p>
<p>What is the risk of having these trucks on the road? I understand something like the Acadia plant has three compressed natural gas trucks a day hooking up and delivering compressed natural gas, so there are risks there, but we accept that. We need to go forward with this made-in-Nova Scotia industry, as the Wheeler report says, to go slow - not just wash our hands of it as a government, but to provide the regulatory framework to be able to go forward in a way that makes sense, to go slow, to establish whether in fact we do have that resource, to be able to have the community engagement to be able to get the social licence, and to be able to get the buy-in so that we could have this industry in our area.</p>
<p>We have so many constituents in each one of our constituencies who are already participating in this natural gas and hydraulic fracturing out West. I think of my constituent who I met a couple of mornings ago, named Rory, who had been working out West, and he was actually working in the waste water business in Alberta. He was telling me about the regulations that they follow out there, fairly elaborate comprehensive regulations. I think that is something that we, as a province, could be doing too.</p>
<p>Another thing that I wanted to address, Mr. Speaker, was the fact that we as a caucus had - and I'm sure that you had - received a number of people who had given information back, just like my friend Rory who gave me a verbal, there have been a number of Nova Scotians who believe that this is not the right direction. I realize that this is an ongoing debate in the province, and like I said, I think we need to move the social licence for this forward in a go-slow manner. Clearly this is a very anti-business bill that sends a very unfortunate signal.</p>
<p>Again, I'm going until - I have four more minutes? That's what I have? I have to think about what I want to sum up with - I better sum up. I don't know how I can sum up 56 minutes. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>I will sum up by saying that I believe it is the role of government not to just abandon the debate, but I believe the moratorium does that. It just puts a halt to the debate. I don't believe it is the role of the government to do that. I think it is the role of government to do things like the Wheeler report where we went around the province and we got a set of recommendations.</p>
<p>To go forward, I think it's the role of government to engage the public, to have the debate, to look at all of the issues and to go forward. I think that this bill sends a very, very unfortunate signal again across Canada. I think the opportunity is there for us to have world-class regulations, and we're not taking that opportunity. I think that we could be taking more time on this bill. I know we had an amendment to push the debate six months down the road and I spoke to that. I do believe that was the right thing to do. I think that this bill needs to be much better thought out to sort out the issues that those against the bill from both sides have with the bill.</p>
<p>These are reasons why this bill is not a good bill for this Legislature to pass. There needs to more time put in for all the definitions. It has been very clearly pointed out that the minister has not really provided the answers. The definitions in the bill need to be there. Most of the bills that we see before the House do have definitions. I know the minister has said that those will show up in the regulations, but when there are such glaring deficiencies in the bill, in a one-page bill, I think that this bill is clearly not the right bill for this province. This unfortunately will be a bill that will be remembered. It is a watershed moment in our province, I think, and by that I mean that after this bill, everything will be different until we have a government that is pro-business on all those things.</p>
