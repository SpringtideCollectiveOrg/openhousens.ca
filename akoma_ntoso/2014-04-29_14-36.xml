          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Yesterday members of the Law Amendments Committee heard from a large number of young Nova Scotians who object to the elimination of the Graduate Retention Rebate. I think one young Nova Scotian, Robert Parker, put it best when he said, "Given the disappointing results since the Ivany report came out, even those of us who are most committed to living and working in Nova Scotia are thinking about whether it makes sense to stay, and for how long."</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the Premier, at a time when our province needs more young people than ever, why is his government disappointing them instead of making it easier for them to stay?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think what most of the presenters said yesterday is that the program, the GRR program, did not do what it was intended to do. What they were actually concerned about was the fact that all that money was not put back into reducing tuition or rebate programs.</p>
<p>What we have heard loud and clear from university graduates, community college graduates, graduates from high school, is that they need a job, something to attach them to the workforce. What we have done is targeted job creation opportunities for the people of this province and young Nova Scotians, to get an opportunity to work and raise their families in this province. Like every government, we will continue to work on the affordability of post-secondary education.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in fact what we heard over and over again last night from our young, best and brightest, is that they feel betrayed by this government which cancelled the Graduate Retention Rebate program with nothing to take its place. In fact, they are looking for jobs.</p>
<p>We have a report, the Ivany report, that makes many recommendations on how to turn the economy around but this government in its first budget turned its back on the Ivany report and has nothing in place to get going on creating the jobs that we all so desperately want, particularly our young, best and brightest, so no wonder they are disappointed, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the Premier, where in the Ivany report does it say to find new ways to disappoint young Nova Scotians and send them away?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, that is one of the most pathetic questions I've ever heard in this House. This government will continue to work with the business community across this province to provide good opportunities for university and community college graduates to stay and work in this province.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what is pathetic is that a whole group of young Nova Scotians, our best and brightest, had to come down to Province House and demand action from a government that has two sessions of this House under its belt, and six months, and a road map to success from the Ivany report, that sits back and does nothing but disappoint them and listen to them tell the government that they are betrayed by a government that cancels their one hope of a job here, that gives young Nova Scotians the highest tax increase in our province's history. That is what is pathetic.</p>
<p>I'll ask the Premier this, the title of the Ivany report is <i>Now or Never,</i> so how long will young Nova Scotians have to wait before they actually do something positive for them, instead of take things away?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what we have done is invested in young Nova Scotians. We've broadened the apprenticeship opportunities in this province. For decades people have been telling us we had to do something about apprenticeship opportunities in this province. In six months we delivered for the people of this province. Young Nova Scotians who want to do research have had to leave this province and go to Ontario and other parts of Canada. We've delivered for those university graduates.</p>
<p>One of the things the Ivany report said was we need to engage the private sector - this government is engaging the private sector to create job opportunities for those university and community college graduates here at home.</p></speech>

<p>As we've seen in Alberta, despite repeated assurances that amalgamating their former nine health regions into one would save millions in administrative costs, those savings have not materialized and costs have skyrocketed. Last week the Minister of Health and Wellness said the cost of amalgamating Nova Scotia's nine DHAs would be "minimal".</p>
<p>My question for the Premier is, would the Premier explain what areas the department has identified that will add to this minimal cost of amalgamation?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I think what has been said prior to the last election, during the last election, and since the last election, is what we're going to be doing is taking the savings out of administration and drive into front-line health care. What we're going to take instead of an administrative-focused health care system, we're going to make sure it's focused on patients.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my office has obtained, through the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and I'll table it, a briefing note regarding amalgamation costs. The Department of Health and Wellness has identified a whole slew of early costs associated with DHA amalgamation - consultant costs, staff costs, travel costs, information technology and systems change costs, including SAP requirements - and we know that could end up being a bit expensive - polling and communication costs, new board costs, and severance costs. These are the early costs.</p>
<p>Now that we know the department knows there will be a lot of costs for DHA amalgamation, why won't the Premier tell Nova Scotians how much his reorganization of health care is really going to cost?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm sure the honourable member would know that would be advice to the minister. Unlike the former government, we will take the best possible advice and ensure the decisions we make are in the best interests of all Nova Scotians and we will ensure that our health care system is focused on patients and not administration.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, if the Premier would check he would see that health care administrative costs went down by 2 per cent under the previous administration. His plan is going to add to the administrative costs of health care in the province. The Minister of Health and Wellness has repeatedly said that he could not provide an estimate of the cost of the DHA amalgamation because estimates have not yet been developed, but that same briefing note says there are estimates for all the categories that I have outlined today and the briefing note indicates the financial component has been approved.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, unless the Premier is prepared to tell this House that he has given the Minister of Health and Wellness a blank cheque for DHA amalgamation, I again ask the Premier, what are the estimated costs for the health board amalgamation?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. It turns out that Nova Scotia's manufacturing exports fell again last month and are now down almost 9 per cent over the past year - and I will table that for the benefit of the House. That is the worst performance in all of Canada. The Ivany report specifically says we should focus on manufacturing jobs because those are good jobs. They hear the Premier saying that's not his problem, that's up to the private sector.</p>
<p>I will ask the Premier, in light of this abysmal performance in such an important area of our economy, what more evidence does he need to take some action instead of being hands-off when it comes to the Ivany report recommendations?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think if he actually continued to read the Ivany report, what it says is those decisions should not be made by Cabinet; they should be made by an arm's-length board of business leaders. That's why we've created Invest Nova Scotia and that is why we're expanding the opportunity for NSBI to respond to that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our government will continue to deliver, to ensure that not only the manufacturing sector but every small business in this province gets an opportunity to hire highly-qualified, trained individuals in this province.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, here are some decisions that have been made by the Cabinet under the new government: we pay the highest taxes in the country, the young graduates got the biggest tax increase - 275 per cent - in our province's history; they're going to drive our provincial debt up by another $0.5 billion this year and $1 billion in total under their mandate using their own budget numbers. Those are decisions made by the Cabinet that they take ownership of but when it comes to implementing the Ivany report, a road map to turn our economy around, they are hands-off and say no, that's for somebody else to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that's not good enough. No wonder so many young Nova Scotians came here last night to say they feel betrayed by this government. So I'll ask the Premier, when will he listen to the very young Nova Scotians who want to see a real plan, like the Ivany report, in place in this House to turn the economy around and create jobs?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">

          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we had a whole group of young Nova Scotians here looking for leadership from this government to turn the economy around, to follow the Ivany report, to do what it takes to get our economy in a better place, through less regulation and lower taxes and real opportunities. What they got for all the listening the government claims is a 275 per cent increase in their income tax if they stay in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the Ivany report does it say to find new ways to send young Nova Scotia graduates away but that's what they got from this government, Mr. Speaker. There is a reason that the Ivany report is called <i>Now or Never</i>. One young Nova Scotian was very clear last night that what they hear from this government is that when they asked for hope, the answer they got from the Liberal Government is "never".</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the Premier, why has he chosen "never" when so many young Nova Scotians need help now?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we'll continue to work with Nova Scotians to provide them the opportunities here at home.

The economy in Nova Scotia has been stalled for years and we obviously need a jump start. Statistics Canada released its regional data that shows a three-month moving average for labour force characteristics. In Cape Breton over the last five years, as of March 2014, population has decreased by 5,900; labour force has decreased by 2,800. The current unemployment rate is 16.3 per cent and there are currently 9,400 unemployed people in Cape Breton. I will table that document.</p>
<p>Is the minister aware of the increased unemployment in Cape Breton and perhaps the minister can share with the members of this House what steps the Liberal Government has taken to address this alarming show of stats for the Cape Breton region specifically?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, one of the things that should be clear to the member opposite is that we are putting together a plan that helps create the playing field for business to succeed. Government doesn't create jobs; we've been very clear on that. The private sector creates jobs. Our job is to make it possible for businesses, including small and medium-size businesses here in Nova Scotia, to succeed. Thank you.</p>

          <speech by="#6a90d53e-7f2d-4189-b7bd-c98709dcee16"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Unfortunately, Cape Breton Island is not the only area in Nova Scotia suffering from high unemployment rates. Over the same period of time, southern Nova Scotia has seen a decrease by 4,800. Full-time employment has decreased by 5,700, the labour force has decreased by 5,100, and the population has decreased by 4,500. The unemployment rate is 14.3 per cent, and there are 7,700 people who are unemployed.</p>
<p>Is the minister aware of these recently-released stats, and if so, what steps is the minister taking to address the unemployment rate and decreased population, specifically in southern Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

MACFARLANE</from><p>Youth in Nova Scotia are struggling, and just last night in the Law Amendments Committee I listened to over 40 very articulate and inspiring students who are struggling. Jobs are not here for them, and on top of that, graduates have just received the biggest tax increase they will probably ever see. Over the past five years, our young people between the ages of 15 and 24 have seen their population decrease by 7,200, full-time employment decrease by 4,000, and part-time employment decrease by 3,000. The unemployment rate for this age group across the province is 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Why hasn't the minister done anything to spur on the labour force for young people, where one in five are unemployed?</p></speech>

REGAN</from><p>I don't know where the member opposite has been, but we've had a number of announcements recently that speak directly to young people. For example, our special operating agency - the bill that is in fact before this House - is one of the things that we are doing to help young Nova Scotians train quicker than they have in the past, have a more effective system, and find good jobs here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We have the Graduate to Opportunities program, which my colleague the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism will be unveiling shortly, and to which we have alluded repeatedly. We have also created a Graduate Scholarship program, which we announced last week, and which was an initiative that was put forward by Students Nova Scotia and supported by CONSUP, the organization that all the university presidents participate in.</p>
<p>There are a variety of different things that we have done for young Nova Scotians to try to make sure that they get the jobs that they are entitled to, Mr. Speaker, and I would point out that in 2008 we saw young males in particular take a huge drop in employment. Those young men are some of the people that we are going to be focusing our efforts on in the coming years, because they are not in the workforce, and we think that's a shame.</p></speech>

The Canadian Institute for Health Information, or CIHI, has noted that health care administrative cost ratios have been declining in Nova Scotia, from 6.3 per cent in 2008-09 to an estimated 4.59 per cent in 2013. That's a 2 per cent decrease in four years that the cost of Nova Scotia's health administration has been reduced, in fact, to the levels of other provinces in the country.</p>
<p>According to the briefing note that I tabled earlier, we now know that the Health and Wellness Department has identified that DHA amalgamation costs will include everything from hiring consultants to polling and severance, and those costs will be anything but minimal.</p>
<p>My question for the Minister of Health and Wellness is, why are the minister and the Premier avoiding letting the public know what these costs are going to be?</p></speech>

MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that is very good to know, but there are a slew of other costs associated with this amalgamation - it's here in this briefing note in black and white. The Minister of Health and Wellness has been attempting to downplay the cost of consolidating health boards suggesting it will be minimal. However, according to the minister's own briefing note: "There will be costs incurred in transition year and the first years of implementation." That's "years", plural - with an "s".</p>
<p>My question through you to the minister is, how many years will Nova Scotia see administrative costs increase due to the DHA amalgamation?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we are taking a very thoughtful and strategically planned move into the one or two health boards, the IWK and the provincial board. We don't plan to do it all in one year. We're going to respect a lot of the good number of the leaders in our health care system and allow attrition to assist us, which will be a big part of moving towards a smaller number of administrators throughout the province. So whether it will be two or three years to accomplish that, that's up to the transition and advisory group who have now started their work under the very capable direction and leadership of former CEO Pat Lee.</p>

MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Alberta, New Brunswick, and now Nova Scotia's own experience under the last Liberal Government has shown that the costs of health administration rise under health care reorganization schemes. According to an article in the Edmonton Journal from January 2011: "The first full fiscal year with that new health authority in charge saw administration costs rise to $390 million, an increase of $46 million - or 13 per cent - over one year."</p>
<p>My last question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, when will the minister finally reveal what the estimated cost of amalgamating the boards will be, and for how many years will Nova Scotia be paying the bill for this with health care dollars?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to respond to that question. I know that probably by September we'll have a better idea of what it may cost and the time period. We've allowed Pat Lee to provide a great deal of work over the next four months on giving us the final structure. One thing I know for sure is that when we finish the process, we will have a leaner and more responsive administrative team that puts the emphasis on leadership and quality patient care first and foremost.</p>

          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, people in southwestern Nova Scotia are very unhappy with the service provided by Eastlink Communications, their broadband service. On a good day their service is probably somewhere near dial-up, and yet they're paying full price for their broadband fees. Today I introduced two petitions with about 700 signatures of people who are disappointed with this service.</p>
<p>My question to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism is, since this service was partially funded by government, what actions can the department take to bring these residents into the current century?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#53fc39ac-a3be-4439-b810-cf2a8cd8b016"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. This is a subject that we had the opportunity to discuss with some of his colleagues in the Official Opposition during estimates. The fact was the broadband initiative for Nova Scotia was announced in 2006 - I believe he may have been part of the government of the day - and it was an ambitious announcement at the time and an ambitious goal.</p>
<p>We are now the third government that has been dealing with this issue and we're disappointed by the fact that there still remain a number of people both in southwestern Nova Scotia and in the Valley area who do not have connectivity or, as the member is pointing out, the level of service is not what anyone would describe as being high speed.</p>
<p>What I can tell the member is that the contract with Eastlink expires at the end of December of this year. We have been in communication with the company to express our disappointment that there are still too many Nova Scotians without high-speed service in the area in question and we are starting to hear more about service issues for those who are connected. I can assure the member that there are continued discussions taking place and we do hope that Eastlink will be bringing a proposal forward to resolve this.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>We know there are a lot of logistics involved in this one as well but in 2014, to say that you have broadband service, you have the connection, you have the wireless system there but you're only connecting at speeds somewhere close to dial-up - it's really not acceptable.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury to the residents along that corridor of the No. 3 Highway that goes from Pubnico Head, through East Pubnico, through Woods Harbour, into Shag Harbour and on to Barrington, there is cable. Maybe not of a service that can provide Internet but at least the wires are going by there. We know of at least two fibre connections that go through that area as well, so why can they not piggy-back off that?</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, really if the contract is coming due and they might put another RFP out or negotiate with Eastlink, I'm just wondering which way is he going with this one? If they're not going to be able to provide the service that is acceptable to Nova Scotians, will he put that out for another RFP?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#53fc39ac-a3be-4439-b810-cf2a8cd8b016"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Well it would be premature to judge what's going to happen, in light of the fact that the contract does continue until the end of December of this year. But in the meantime, our government certainly has not been waiting for that day. I've had the opportunity to hold a number of meetings on this subject, to try to encourage a resolution and try to ensure that people have high-speed service, regardless of where they live in the province.</p>
<p>The member is probably also aware that the federal government recently announced funding would be coming to increase the speed up to 5 BPS I think is the term, but five is the number. I know that many Nova Scotians are not achieving that now so we wait to see exactly how the federal government is going to provide such funding and we'll certainly be there as a partner if such funding is made available, to try to ensure that not only we address the connectivity issues, which are still outstanding, but as well that we make sure that Nova Scotians are getting the quality high speed they need in order to maintain our province's competitive edge in that regard. Merci.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Je remercie le ministre pour sa r&#xE9;ponse, mais en m&#xEA;me temps, I think what we need to understand is that these people are unable to do the work that they really need to do. If you're putting remittances in with CRA, if you're doing some basic Internet, like sending a picture to a friend or even cruising on Facebook, they really can't do it. We know what Facebook does to the rest of us; it is our way to keep connected to the area.</p>
<p>I know the member for Yarmouth, the Minister of Natural Resources - there are people in his constituency like the Pinkneys Point area, around Melbourne and into Comeau's Hill who are having the same kind of connection problem. I know we really need to work hard to ensure that they are brought into the current century.</p>
<p>Hearing all the answers that the minister has given, maybe I'll just give him another opportunity to give a little synopsis on how this is going to unroll because again, there are lots of moving pieces, lots of people who are involved in it. Is it just working with Eastlink or is it going to be a program that's going to be rolled out to other players?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#53fc39ac-a3be-4439-b810-cf2a8cd8b016"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Merci M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, et merci &#xE0; mon coll&#xE8;gue. C'est sans question : avoir acc&#xE8;s &#xE0; l'Internet &#xE0; haute vitesse, selon moi - je l'ai dit &#xE0; plusieurs reprises ici &#xE0; la Maison - c'est la m&#xEA;me chose qu'avoir acc&#xE8;s &#xE0; l'&#xE9;lectricit&#xE9;. C'est une n&#xE9;cessit&#xE9;, ce n'est pas un privil&#xE8;ge, mais c'est quelque chose &#xE0; quoi tous les gens en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse ont le droit.</p>
<p>Puisqu'ils s'attendent &#xE0; avoir ce service-l&#xE0;, Mr. Speaker, what I can tell the honourable member - it's always great to see the use of both official languages here in the House (Applause) - it's a fact that we will be working closely with the federal government.</p>
<p>I guess as I told the member's colleagues during the Budget Estimates, there are discussions taking place. I'm not at liberty to share those discussions on the floor of the House, but I want to assure the member and all colleagues that we take this matter very seriously. We are encouraging Eastlink to come up with a solution to this, and we are hopeful that this is going to happen.</p>
<p>Those discussions will continue to take place, and the minute we're in a position to provide more information I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that we will make all members and all Nova Scotians aware of how exactly we are going to address this issue. Merci.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. Last night approximately 40 Nova Scotian students and young graduates appeared at Law Amendments Committee to tell us how the government and the Premier had betrayed them. To demonstrate this betrayal the Dalhousie Student Union presented a lengthy list of broken promises the Liberals had made, which I will table.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, prior to the election, the Premier and members of his Cabinet made it very clear they were going to make university more affordable and improve programs that could help retain graduates in Nova Scotia. Instead, what has the Premier done in his first budget? He has cut $50 million that supported students and graduates, money that has not been reinvested.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a far cry from comments made by the Premier on November 23, 2011, when he was in Opposition, "We should be doing everything we can to encourage our young people to learn and work in Nova Scotia."</p>
<p>My question for the Premier is, how is taking $50 million away from students and grads and not reinvesting it in programs that would encourage them to learn and work in Nova Scotia, doing everything he can?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the honourable member that not one student actually was receiving any of that money. Students have told us loudly and clearly that they want an opportunity to work in this province. What we've done is targeted towards job creation, to provide those young people with a job in this province so they can stay here, work, and raise their families.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's unfortunate that the Premier didn't have an opportunity to hear the students first-hand last night, because student leaders spoke of their frustration that the Liberal Government had used their expressed desire for improvements to the Graduate Retention Rebate as an excuse to eliminate the program - this is not what students had been asking for.</p>
<p>Once again, this is not the Liberal Government they were promised just six months ago. On October 5, 2009, the current Health and Wellness Minister said that we always had the ability to improve and move forward with a retention program that I think can be much more based on accessibility and in lowering tuition rates.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier is, in cutting the Graduate Retention Rebate and not reinvesting most of that money back into programs for students, where is the program the Minister of Health and Wellness spoke about in Opposition that would be based in accessibility and in lowering tuition rates?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, one of the things that the Leader of the New Democratic Party is not telling Nova Scotians is that all of the information, all of the history of this program, shows it wasn't working. She suggested we should continue to plow money into programs that aren't working. What we've clearly said is that this is about job creation. We need to provide opportunities for young university, community college, and high school students to get a job here in this province. We are targeting towards working with small-business owners to ensure that happens; we've invested in research opportunities.</p>
<p>While they were in government, young Nova Scotians were leaving this province to do research in other parts of Canada. We've said that's not good enough; let's invest in research and give them an opportunity here. We continue to do some of the work that I know the member for Cape Breton Centre was working on when he was Minister of Labour and Advanced Education, which was ensuring that more apprentice opportunities are here in Nova Scotia - that's what we're investing in. It's about creating a job in this province so that young Nova Scotians can stay and work at home.</p></speech>

            <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, probably the most common theme from last night was that the Premier and government members, who said they were on the side of students when they were in Opposition, are ignoring the concerns that students have now that they are in government. My question for the Premier isn't actually my own question, it's a question that was first asked by the member for Bedford when she was in Opposition, "Why is it okay to be on the side of students when you are in Opposition and then ignore them when you go into government?"</p>

I agree with her. It's why we put investment in job opportunities in this province for young Nova Scotians. But there's no question, there's more work to be done and this government will continue to work with student leaders, university presidents, and people across this province to ensure we can make sure university is affordable for all young Nova Scotians.</p>

            <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you this afternoon is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. A couple of weeks ago we learned that the palliative care patients were spending their final days in a rodent-infested ward. Last week we found out that the cardiovascular intensive care unit is dealing with a scabies outbreak. Patients and families are at their most vulnerable when they enter a health care system, yet they continue to be subjected to second-rate conditions. My question to the minister is, what does he say to the Nova Scotians who are looking for health care but are finding mice and mites?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, those are conditions that are unacceptable in terms of the total requirements of good, quality patient care. With respect to their environment, we do know - all Nova Scotians know - that the Centennial Building is in a very deteriorated condition. What I can assure the member for Argyle-Barrington is that both those situations now are well under control and the one guarantee that I know, and he as a former minister knows, is that there is no second-rate care at the QEII.</p>

          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I didn't say the care was second rate, I definitely said the conditions were second rate. For a long time we've been dealing with issues, especially with the Centennial Building. This was a bit of a disturbing trend though and I think the communication issue that was underlying is one that will continue to be important for the minister because I believe he needs to know things are happening when they are happening, not a couple of days late, which I think is what happened in both of these instances right now.</p>
<p>How is the minister going to stay on top of these issues because it's he and his department that can make these changes to make patients' lives more bearable, when they're in a facility like the Centennial Building?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, one of the approaches that is being taken immediately at the QEII is taking a look at all of the units in terms of their physical environment while they also do some staff assessment. This will be an ongoing challenge to make sure that a deteriorating environment is looked after as fully as possible to make sure that people's stay, long or short, does not have to deal with the issues that we have had in the last couple of weeks.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>It seems like it was just yesterday, but it was quite some time ago when we were having problems in the transition unit in that same building, where it did get closed down and the patients got transferred to other units in the system. I'm wondering, is there an opportunity to re-look at the way we're providing care, especially when it comes to the Centennial Building, so that outbreaks like rodents and mice and scabies will not continue to plague our system, and to allow surgeries and procedures to be done in our health care system? We can't allow these things to happen, so that our system doesn't continue to get bogged down with those kinds of issues.</p>
<p>Maybe the minister can talk quickly about how we are going to move on from this. How can we identify other places for these individuals to go to get the life-changing services that they need from our health care system?</p></speech>

<p>In a video produced for the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, the newly-elected Leader of the Liberal Party said in 2008, "We have the second highest gas taxes in the country. The only thing &#x2026;" we have any "&#x2026; control over at all, is the tax we charge on a litre of gas."

I want to thank him for the question. It's a very serious issue that many Nova Scotians are feeling the cost of the rise of gasoline in this province. It's why, when I meet with the Premiers of Atlantic Canada in May, I've committed to talking about decoupling the tax so that we do not charge the HST on top of the motive fuel tax here in Atlantic Canada. I'm looking forward to having that conversation on behalf of Nova Scotians.</p>

On Friday the Premier suggested in <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> that the only way to move forward with changes to gas pricing in Nova Scotia is to go at it with the other Maritime Provinces - the answer the Premier just gave. But, Mr. Speaker, once again I'll remind the Premier that when he was in Opposition he said that the only thing we have any control over at all - that's our province that he was talking about - is the gas tax charge on a litre of gas. This is just another example that the Premier was saying one thing prior to the election and doing something else when he is in government.</p>

We know their position in Opposition; it's a little different now in government. Even the Premier's own Finance and Treasury Board Minister doesn't agree with him. She said in the same article that I just tabled that it would be really irresponsible to start rebating taxes or changing our tax system in a way that would just put us deeper in the hole.</p>
<p>I know with those concerns from the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, it was on the Premier's position, I believe it may be his first position or the second one or maybe the new one that he has now, Mr. Speaker.

          <speech by="#9eb5d12a-69bf-4e1b-a8d2-022f2ff48f25"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Minister of Health and Wellness. I can't say that it will be a nice question but it's a very serious question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating lung disease affecting thousands of people across the country. As the disease progresses, individuals have a very low quality of life and suffer each day. A new drug approved by Health Canada is Esbriet, which can improve lungs and extend the lives of those affected. However, it is not covered in Nova Scotia and it does cost $40,000 a year.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister consider extending provincial Pharmacare coverage to this new drug?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what I can tell the member opposite is that in the next few weeks it is one of those briefings and reviews that we will be taking a look at in the department. I am very familiar, having met national representatives who have provided background on the devastating impacts of this disease. It's an area that we will be getting more information, especially around the new treatment that is available.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#9eb5d12a-69bf-4e1b-a8d2-022f2ff48f25"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for that answer. Individuals and their families are reaching out to their government because this drug offers them hope. Environmental exposure to contaminants like coal dust, silica and asbestos are believed to be the leading causes of this disease - and I'll table the document to that effect.</p>
<p>As the minister knows, exposure to these materials is something many Nova Scotians have endured while working in industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining and because of our special circumstances, the province should immediately look into the coverage of Esbriet. Will the minister commit to looking at Esbriet coverage based on these special circumstances of the individuals of our province?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for that question. These people have developed this lung condition through no fault of theirs, very often induced by the workplace conditions that they laboured in, and I think it's an important issue for us to review in the coming weeks and get some idea of the number of Nova Scotians who are impacted and also review with some other jurisdictions how they've gone about dealing with this new treatment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#9eb5d12a-69bf-4e1b-a8d2-022f2ff48f25"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, again, thank you to the minister. Over time the shortness of breath patients experience begins to deprive vital organs of the necessary oxygen needed to survive. Without a lung transplant, life expectancy ranges from only two to five years - and I'll table a document to that effect. Like many of these serious diseases, time is not a friend to these people.</p>
<p>My final question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, what advice can the minister give families of patients who are suffering from this disease who haven't got a lot of time to advocate and wait for this drug to help their loved one?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Sydney River-Mira- Louisbourg for bringing this to the floor of the Legislature. It is indeed a disease with a debilitating outlook for these patients as time goes along, and it is one we'll need to give consideration to in very short order. Once again, I thank the member for bringing the question to the floor.</p>

Last night we began to hear about a landlord who is trying to evict residents from the Troy Trailer Court as early as June 11<sup>th</sup>. From what I understand, the landlord cannot do that unless residents have not paid their rent or if there are issues of poor behaviour.</p>
<p>Residents must be given 12 months' notice, and that only comes after an order is approved by a residential tenancies officer. Will the minister confirm if that is correct?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. MARK FUREY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague across the floor for the question. I certainly want to recognize the anxiety and upheaval that these circumstances are presenting to the residents in this community. The purpose of the Residential Tenancies Act is to provide efficient and cost-effective means for dispute resolution. The Act specifically outlines what's required of landlords in their dealings with tenants and the options available to landlords - and the circumstances that my colleague has presented are, in fact, accurate.</p>

            <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, it is reassuring to know for the people who are living there that there is some protection for them. As I understand, residents can file an application to ensure they get the required 12 months. Can the minister explain if that is necessary for all residents to file that application, or if at least one resident files that application will that take care of everybody in the area in question?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know from discussion with staff that individual tenants have had contact with our access centre in Port Hawkesbury, as well as our provincial contact centre. They are being provided the instruction consistent with the legislation in the act to file individual applications for purposes of moving this matter forward.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the residents deserve more respect, I believe, from their landlord. I don't believe this is any way to treat people, to just come out and try to evict people in only a short time of six weeks. Will the minister confirm for those residents today, as he has his past two answers, will the minister confirm that he will use the laws found in the Residential Tenancies Act to protect them for at least the next 12 months so that they have proper time to make arrangements for a new home?</p>

            <p>Again, I thank my colleague for the question. The points being made are very appropriate and I think the bottom line here is that to give legal eviction notices to close these land-lease communities, or any community where there is a tenancy-landlord agreement, the landlord would be required to make that application through the process. I can assure my colleague in Opposition and the residents of this land-lease community that we will apply the legislation as it was intended, to protect the best interest of those homeowners and tenants.</p>

          <speech by="#5db3f08e-219e-4ab3-a082-7bcc7ed081b1"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>My question is for the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, the Premier. Mr. Speaker, the community of Eskasoni was in distress back in 2008 after a series of youth suicides. With the assistance of the federal and provincial governments at the time, a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week crisis line was established. In 2012 the province took over the larger share of that funding when the federal government backed out.</p>
<p>A recent Department of Health and Wellness briefing note obtained under the freedom of information request - and I'll table that in a second, Mr. Speaker - shows that the current Liberal Government will provide no further funding to sustain the Eskasoni hotline. So I want to know, through you to the Premier, will the Premier please explain why his government is removing support from this vital service?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>I want to thank the honourable member for the question. I had the great privilege of being in Eskasoni a few months ago and saw the tremendous work that the community is doing. I felt optimistic, quite frankly, when I left with the fact that so many young people are hopeful for the future, being trained, looking at chances to create their own businesses, create opportunities in that province.</p>
<p>The crisis hotline was part of the conversation that we had with the chief and council; part of that discussion was ensuring that as the crisis hotline, which is actually distributed across the entire province, could be become part of what the Aboriginal community in the province could continually work towards and build into.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5db3f08e-219e-4ab3-a082-7bcc7ed081b1"><from>MR. CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, while I somewhat respect the answer, it didn't go a mile near the question. The fact is that your government is not going to support this crisis line. This crisis line is very unique, as the member for Victoria-the-Lakes who represents it could rightfully say. In this case the government plans to use a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
<p>This is very important to our First Nation people to have such a crisis line where they can talk to their peers, especially in their own language, and that is very, very important because it is much broader than what the original version had contemplated. As bad as suicides are and were, it expanded into many aspects of communal life within that First Nation community. I want to reiterate and ask the Premier again, why doesn't his government see the value of that line and why won't he invest in it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>We absolutely see the value in that service, it's why we are ensuring that the crisis hotline across the province deals with the issues the member brought forward around language and in the culture, Mr. Speaker. We want to ensure that all Aboriginal communities will be covered by a broad-based program across the province. We're continuing that conversation with leaders, with chiefs in every Aboriginal community in this province, to ensure that they feel they're receiving the services from their government that they deserve.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the Minister of Health and Wellness, who I know has met with a number of the chiefs on this very issue as recently as today. Let's be clear, this government is going to continue to invest to ensure that Aboriginal communities and every community across this province get access to a hotline, to ensure that we will be there for any Nova Scotian who feels in need of support.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, first I'd like to thank the House for the privilege of presenting this bill. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize Jeremy Akerman and the Association of XMLAS. This association had its first annual meeting on December 21, 2013. At this time, the association agreed to seek incorporation by an Act of the Legislature.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Akerman and was advised that the association currently has 104 active members, with 20 or 30 more waiting to join. I would encourage everybody in this House to be involved in that when their day comes.</p>
<p>This association has already been engaged in discussions about democratic processes with several groups, including the Springtide Collective, schools, Girl Guide groups, and Elections Nova Scotia. I believe that you even had the opportunity just recently to engage in some interesting dialogue with the association over a meal last weekend, Mr. Speaker, so congratulations to you.</p>

After this experience, this honour, I think a lot of people have a lot to continue to offer our communities. We have a wealth of information from our experiences here and as we move on to the other parts of our careers, of our lives, I think we would want to continue serving our communities, talking about democracy, talking about the things that are important to us here today, and will be important to us 20 years hence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for 160 years the chancellor at St. F.X. has been the bishop. Of what significance is that? Well I believe it was in 1827 that the penal laws were finally repealed in this province and the following year Father William MacLeod, the pioneer of higher education in the diocese of Antigonish, wrote a letter to Bishop Plessis with the idea of starting a school. That school became St. F.X.</p></speech>

            <from>AN HON. MEMBER</from>
            <p>Where did it start?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4d1fe702-74c5-4f85-8807-4d4ee51c02a2"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>I'm coming to that. But prior to that, and prior to that development, going back to 1758 when the penal laws were in effect, Catholics could not sit in this Legislature; they could not vote; they could not purchase land and their children couldn't be educated in their faith. So what standing did these people have in society before that was changed? If they did violate any of those measures, they could have their goods confiscated. On a second offence they could face punishment of banishment and on a third offence they could receive punishment of death.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, St. F.X. began in the heart of Father William MacLeod and it was through the charity of the faithful believers, people from Antigonish, from Guysborough, from Pictou, from Richmond, from Inverness, and I could probably name people from just about every corner of this province, it was these people who gave their donations and gave their sons and daughters to the church who chose to become the priests and sisters, who would form the faculty and staff that created St. F.X.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that was all under the guidance and support of the nine bishops who have served in that time as chancellors of St. F.X. This bill removes the bishop as chancellor and sends a clear message about where the Board of Governors wants St. F.X. to go. It wants St. F.X. to go away from its roots, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>I am opposed to this legislation and I ask you to join me, to withhold its passage until there is broad consultation with the St. F.X. community. I would ask that the members opposite listen to this speech because there has not been broad consultation. I think the members opposite will want to take that into account before they try to pass it in this sitting of the Legislature.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism correctly pointed out, St. F.X. actually started - the first classes were in Grand Narrows and in East Bay - and eventually it was moved to Arichat because Isle Madame was at the time the See of the Diocese and when it was moved to Antigonish the university was moved to Antigonish.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm very curious to see how the government responds to this speech because not a lot of people know about this and as people are starting to find out about it, they are questioning it. So my aim today is to present some of those facts in the Legislature so the members can hear about it and obviously have Opposition members here who have constituents affected by this as well, and they will have a chance to vote on this as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I will begin: faith and reason are not opposed. Some people would say that science and religion can never meet to discover the truth. Not so. The very motto of St. F.X., "Whatsoever Things Are True", which comes from a verse of Philippians, reflects a commitment to the intellectual and spiritual development of its students. Whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the dignity of every human person compels the church to begin health and education and provide those services to the masses. Prior to that, education only belonged to the elites. It could also be said that education was sometimes used by the elites to maintain power over the rest of society for the generation of personal wealth.</p>
<p>We can see in a speech that I delivered here in the last sitting, in the Fall, on the Gaelic College and how education was used. We all know what happened with the issue with the Gaelic College: the board changed their mind on that, because they had to. There was a public outcry, and it came in part by way of a speech delivered in this Legislature.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would just finish on that. Education was used through the Statutes of Iona in 1609 to force Gaelic leaders in Scotland to send their sons, their future heirs, to England to be educated there, and distanced from their people and their culture. This action was designed to undermine and destroy the Gaelic language and culture, amongst other measures, which led to the immigration of these peoples to many of our constituencies here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Today, because the church took an active role in bringing health care and education to the masses, there are 117,000 Catholic schools, universities, and hospitals throughout the world. In Nova Scotia, when we look - and we just had a budget here - at the Departments of Health and Wellness and Education and Early Childhood Development consisting of 60 per cent of the budget, it's very obvious what value the church played in those institutions, providing those services to people, albeit doing their works through charitable donations. It was great value for the province achieved through that.</p>
<p>One could say, get with the times - we don't need the bishop or the leadership that founded St. F.X., but to that I say, vision and principles, especially those that founded St. F.X., never go out of style. What is the point of tradition at St. F.X.? Well, I think of one of its most prized achievements: the Antigonish Movement, championed by a couple of priests, Father Jimmy Tompkins and Father Moses Coady. The idea was to help the common man and woman to participate in the economy by removing the control of the established elites. More money stayed in the pockets of these people, and they built a better future.</p>
<p>Why were priests doing this work? Because they were at St. F.X., a school that provided them with the knowledge and freedom to focus on whatsoever things are true. Father Coady was quoted one time, Mr. Speaker - and I can only imagine he was probably questioned about why he, as a priest, would have anything to do with this type of activity - but he was quoted as saying, "We consider it good pedagogy and good psychology to begin with the economic phase &#x2026; that we may the more readily attain the spiritual and cultural toward which all our efforts are directed."</p>
<p>Good things were happening at St. F.X. because of that spiritual power. The faithful person would say that they were happening with the direction taken by the bishop and chancellor at the time who sent Father Tompkins to Canso, the very type of place where the co-operative movement was needed most. I'm sure the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie knows that story and the good works that took place out of Canso, that helped to develop that area.</p>
<p>The same bishop responded with the blessing of an extension department and the eventual creation of the Coady Institute, which teaches people from around the world these same principles today. If we did not have the faith of the people with the structure of the church, you would never have had Father Jimmy Tompkins or Father Moses Coady, and you may never have had the Antigonish Movement.</p>
<p>What about the charity that built St. F.X.? Mr. Speaker, we think about the working class, who sometimes paid their children's tuition in food to the university. Donations were made by the working poor with the encouragement of their spiritual leaders. We think that most people in eastern Nova Scotia were probably only coming to the first generation today where they are actually able to pass on some dollar wealth to their children, some inheritances to their children, to their heirs. Before that, these people were from very humble means, but they were still making donations over the past to St. F.X What about the charity in the form of the vow of poverty taken by the men and women who became the priests and sisters who became the professors and staff of St. F.X., dedicating their life to this institution and its principles?</p>
<p>What is driving the introduction of this legislation requested by the board of governors at St. F.X.? We can only surmise that if we are talking about Coady or Tompkins, it is okay, but if we are talking about the principles of the church that created those causes, no, they don't want that anymore. Yet it was this church that created St. F.X., the institution that graduated the first Catholic woman in North America in 1897. This happened largely because of the influence of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Speaking of Notre Dame, what does that most prestigious university have for its governance model? It is certainly not going in the same direction. Their model honours its founders with six of its 12 fellows being priests. So what is the board of governors doing? Drop the Catholic identity, drop the integrity, drop the motto from the university's logo, which happened in 1998, drop the bishop as chancellor in 2014 - Mr. Speaker, you might as well drop the name St. F. X., St. Francis Xavier because the X spirit that started this storied institution is no longer there. Maybe we should call it the X-University. That way it would be more relevant to a broader group of students.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is more than about a disgraced bishop who was caught in possession of child pornography. Sadly, it appears the act of this one bishop has managed to shape the minds of the board of governors more than the many great men and women who made the same vows and who made St. F. X.; perhaps the board has lost its faith. When people lose faith they look for reasons to abandon it. St. Francis Xavier had faith and I don't know - and I see a member giving me the thumbs up and showing his ring - but I don't know if a lot of people know the story of St. Francis Xavier but he is considered to be the greatest missionary since the time of the apostles.</p>
<p>Most of his missionary work took place during the 1540s throughout India, Japan and China. Oftentimes these saints faced great challenges to their faith, much like the people of the diocese of Antigonish have faced in recent years, but a faith tested is strong and true. I think of a distant cousin of mine who I am most proud of. We would have to go back to Scotland to trace that lineage but she lived in Australia in the 1800s and in 2010 she was made a saint. I recall proudly reading a resolution about that in this Legislature at the time. She is now Saint Mary MacKillop and her life is dedicated to the education of the poor.</p>
<p>I think it's important that we bring to light these kinds of things because so often we hear so many things that are negative about the church and its role in our society today. Her life was dedicated to the education of the poor. She and the spiritual order she began cared for neglected children, for girls in danger, the aged, poor and incurably ill. Her order worked with the people who were forgotten. They followed farmers, railway workers and miners into the developing outback of Australia, sharing the same hardships while educating their children.</p>
<p>Her faith was tested when she was excommunicated for insubordination after maintaining her resolve to continue her work, despite the efforts of others in the church who sought revenge on her order for reporting the abuse of children by a priest. Sound familiar? But she did not lose her faith and in the end her schools reopened and her important work continued.</p>
<p>Contrast the humility of the men and women who gave up their lives with a vow of poverty, the people who became the priests and the sisters who built St. F. X., with those now who wish to have their personal legacies attached to the university, to place their names on buildings and claim the prestige from those we now forget, and in law, forget with the passage of this bill, with the removal of the bishop, the spiritual head of the university, as chancellor. Yes, donations are important and so is humility and it will certainly be worth a lot more in the next world.</p>
<p>The education of so many St. F. X. students happened because of the charity of the highly-educated clergy. This and the work of the Sisters of St. Martha and the donations of local Catholics of modest means, subsidized the educational experience of those who wear and still wear the X ring.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I was on the Internet not long ago and I discovered that I actually went to the Schwartz School of Business. I went to St. F.X., that's the university I went to. No disrespect to Mr. Schwartz, and his donations are obviously appreciated by the university, but I went to St. F.X.</p>
<p>One could say that this is progress and that schools of higher learning can no longer be run on charity but, Mr. Speaker, do we have to sell out the very founders of the university? Do we have to sell out for whom the university was started and for what purpose it was started?</p>
<p>There has obviously been an effort to change St. F.X. Apparently some who have claimed to be touched by the X spirit have never truly been touched by it. Maybe it was lost in the values of prestige, a sense of an intellectual entitlement, or perhaps a more combative disagreement with the Church on some matter where personal pride won out. If those so bent on changing St. F.X. would open their hearts to the principles which founded the university - the Christian principles of charity, respect for the human person, and seeking to know the truth - those people would begin to see the Church as a valuable leadership component of St. F.X. To understand that the principles and principals who created the X spirit are an inherent part of the school's identity and the bishop should always hold the leadership position of the board of governors at St. F.X.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we have a new president at St. F.X., Dr. Kent MacDonald. I think this is an opportunity for the president to take this matter on and it's an opportunity for alumni at St. F.X. to get involved now that they are starting to learn about this turn of events, because it certainly wasn't something that was communicated broadly, it certainly wasn't something that was presented in the <i>Alumni News</i>, and it certainly doesn't appear to be something that the board of governors is especially proud of. Otherwise, there would have been consultation.</p>
<p>With that, may I recommend that this Legislature withhold passage of this bill until there is broad consultation with the St. F.X. community. Surely after 160 years, taking the time to ask Xaverians if they feel it is best for their school to stand arm in arm with those who founded it is the right thing to do, and it has become our responsibility in this Legislature. Let Xaverians decide the direction of their university before this Legislature changes it for them.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#c51d6556-5a76-4dd0-8625-3b6f71e9c75b"><from>MR. LLOYD HINES</from><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the member opposite for his thoughtful comments and great historical perspective on this venerable institution. I have to say that I agree with much of the things he said, but not all.</p>
<p>If you read the bill, then it clearly does not prohibit the bishop of the Diocese of Antigonish from becoming the chancellor of the university. However, in a progressive institution, Mr. Speaker, it does provide the opportunity for somebody other than the bishop to become the chancellor, which opens that possibility up to a huge number of the graduates of that university who are female.</p>
<p>In terms of consultation, this recommendation came from the students who are members of the community and who sit on the board of governors because they recognized that particular weakness in their process. The bishop can still be chancellor, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>In terms of justice, justice is about providing equity. This bill provides that equity, Mr. Speaker. The students' rights are supressed in the current situation and this will help change the fact that the chancellor will always be male under the current situation.</p>
<p>I want to speak for a minute about the chaplaincy at this university. As a graduate, and I'm sure the member opposite as a graduate would understand the tremendously important role that has in the life of the university. The chaplaincy is very active, is engaged in all the campus community, Mr. Speaker. As a matter of fact, in the legislation in Clause 4(d), one of the codicils sets out that an objective of the university is to "respect the Catholic heritage and character that have formed a vital part of the University's history." I see no diminishment of that particular objective in this proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The board will elect the chancellor. However, the bill goes a little bit further, Mr. Speaker, and in Clause 15(1) it says, "In light of the historical and continuing relationship between the Diocese and the University, the Bishop shall occupy the position of the Vicar of the Founder of the University." The founder of the university, and the member opposite did such a great job of explaining the roots that make this university strong. This legislation will continue to make it strong into the future.</p>

<p>During second reading, during a number of presentations in Law Amendments Committee, throughout this process, we've been definitely calling this the bait-and-switch bill - one that the Premier and the Liberal Party during the last election promised to take the efficiency charge off the bills of Nova Scotians. I hear the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism saying they did. What the people didn't expect, though, was that it was just for a short period of time - for a few months, until it gets added again when Nova Scotia Power asks for a rate increase because the bill allowed Nova Scotia Power to recoup those charges from the rate base.</p>
<p>In the end what this does is, it goes from a place where we know how much we're spending on efficiency programs - which of course are important and ones that will continue to reduce our energy footprint in Nova Scotia, will continue to save Nova Scotians money but, at the same time - it's a little bit half-hearted in how it addresses this - it does dump it back on that ratepayer in the long run.</p>
<p>Throughout this whole process, it has been a somewhat complicated one because there were a number of things that were added to the announcement. Of course that was the issue of Nova Scotia Power funding low-income upgrades to Nova Scotians, which are kind of part of it but kind of not. They were sort of dumped together in the same one to make it all sound that much better.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I've heard many times from the minister saying that it will save Nova Scotians far more money. What I'm going to have to say is that we're going to have to watch it. He is going to have to prove it, of course, to Nova Scotians because it's not only the Opposition that has been saying that it is a bit of a bait and switch but it's also smoke and mirrors, we can't forget about that one; I think it has been called as well. At the end of the day we're going to want to see the true (Interruption) - a shell game, many words. (Interruption) No, it wasn't a flip-flop; I never called it a flip-flop. I think if the member for Clare-Digby wants to speak to it, I think it's great. He can get up and speak to it as well because he's going to be hearing from his constituents who are going to say listen, my power bills are still too high.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that is the issue. We can save four bucks here and three bucks there but do you know what? At the end of the day, the bills that we see in our constituency offices are far higher than what a regular person pays. A lot of the times there are low-income Nova Scotians who really have a tough time making ends meet and show up to our offices with $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 bills and don't know where to turn in order to address them.</p>
<p>A regular household these days, when they are looking at electric heat, when they are looking at their electricity charges, are seeing bills in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A regular Nova Scotian, a middle-earner in this province is finding it very difficult to pay the power bill. We've seen increases, continued increases over the last number of years, and what we continue to hear is that there will continue to be increases.</p>
<p>I know Nova Scotia Power has made it public that they will not be asking for an increase coming next year but the fuel charges are continuing to rise, gas prices are continuing to rise and doing business in Nova Scotia, as well as around the world, continues to increase as well.</p>
<p>The added piece to this that maybe isn't in the bill, but one that concerns the Opposition, is how Emera right now is looking at saving dollars by looking at the linesmen, the linespeople, the electrical utility workers, the inspectors. How they're trying to either privatize or change - privatize is the wrong word, but to change it from one kind of service to another in order to save money. (Interruption) To be able to contract it out. Thank you to the good member to my left, for Cape Breton Centre. I'm sure he'll have a few words to say too.</p>
<p>You know this all fits together in the rates that we're paying each and every day. If we're going to throw it upon the workers to save money, in order to make up those fuel adjustments and the things that the minister talks about, how can we know that our electrical utility will be there for us? I mean we just talked about it in Question Period, Internet service being as important as electricity today, which is true, but are we going to be taking electricity services and letting them degrade over time because the service people are no longer there keeping them up?</p>
<p>We already know that our storms are getting a little bit stronger, the winds are getting a little stronger, and don't forget salt fog and all the other things that affect our electrical system. (Interruption) Apparently it's real, go figure. As much as we make fun of it, it is a real issue in Nova Scotia. We live next to the coastline and a lot of the electrical insulators, the wire systems, all of them are affected by the weather and just the regular everyday wear and tear from the salt water, the salt air, and I guess the salt fog.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, again this is a bill that we don't agree with. We don't agree with it because we feel that it's a half-measure in its promise to Nova Scotians that the Liberal Party said that they will be removing the tax forever and that is not the case. With those short few words, I want to thank the minister for bringing it forward but saying we don't agree with this bill.</p></speech>

You know it is always interesting when we say stuff during the campaign and bring them forward here and when it finally happens - I realize in the Fall session the minister said he didn't want to have unattended consequences and he'd be waiting for this.</p>
<p>The other difficult side of this, Mr. Speaker, through you, is that while our role in Opposition is not to just simply oppose - it's in such an odd way that you are put in the Westminster system. We do not want government to fail for the sake of failing because, who does that impact? That impacts our constituents too, so sometimes it is a conundrum you find yourself in that you end up talking about these bills. In talking, part of you wants to be wrong; part of you wants to be sure that the bill does the right things and I don't think they do and that's the reality of it.</p>
<p>I don't want to mix up apples and oranges because as part of the response from the Progressive Conservative Energy Critic, he talked about what's going on with the employees, the possible issues that may face the employees at Nova Scotia Power. The problem with the people who work on the line and so on - since the privatization of Nova Scotia Power, they've seen their workforce greatly diminish over these past 20-some-odd years, Mr. Speaker. This is something that one has to really try to grasp because the utility is given a special place in Nova Scotia and they are allowed a certain return and so on.</p>
<p>One would hope that with that responsibility, they would see that they do have a responsibility to all Nova Scotians, and all Nova Scotians would go beyond just the ratepayers. I think that they should keep and pay an adequate size workforce - pay them reasonable monies, give them reasonable benefits, and that's what we would look for. But as the previous speaker stated, there is a fear - and I think it's real, it's not an imagined fear - that the utility is looking at outsourcing many of its services. Sure as shooting, Mr. Speaker, the first areas that are hurt - and we all know it, and I'm not picking on anybody, but we know it, right - is rural Nova Scotia, where there once was a time when we knew in rural Nova Scotia that there would be depots, I guess would be the best way to look at it, and there would be people working into it.</p>
<p>I don't mean to pick on the member for the Canso area, but he knows that the fact is - I'll use his area as an example - that because of some of the remoteness of the area, that if they have to get some clearance from Halifax and get a crew from Halifax to go all the way along there, that is more than just an inconvenience to his residents and his constituents. With the loss of electricity, there are many perils connected - pardon the pun - to that. The fact is that those are the issues.</p>
<p>I would hope that with this bill, Nova Scotia Power understands the responsibility they have to Nova Scotians when it comes to not just the power rates and the electricity they provide, whether it's to industry or individual homes, but what they have to the overall fabric of this province is that they do have business in rural areas, they do have businesses in areas that are not easily accessible. But they are in receipt of some favourable legislation from time to time in this House, and they should think themselves lucky for that. They should be finding a way, when it comes to helping Nova Scotians, that the service they get from their energy provider is the best it can be, and that Nova Scotians should be proud of the largest energy provider here.</p>
<p>Soon they'll be partnering through their parent company, Emera - very soon we'll see actual work being done on the subsea cable coming from Newfoundland and Labrador to Point Aconi and that area, and probably moving on. So what is Nova Scotia Power giving back to its ratepayers? We feel that there's times that we should - that they should be brought more to account of what they're doing. I think when we look at Bill No. 41 and what was going on, especially with Efficiency Nova Scotia and what the - and I'll change my tack here a little bit, Mr. Speaker - about what they've done for Efficiency Nova Scotia - and we've talked to people about some of the efficiency models and the actual work done on people's homes and so on and what they were able to accomplish through Efficiency Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I would hope, as I said earlier, because it's not our desire to see a bill go in a bad direction or whatever - I mean, it's all right to critique it, but we don't want Nova Scotians to be harmed by anything, and I would hope that's the way, when we criticize or critique a bill, that that's what we're thinking of. We're not thinking primarily of they brought it forward, we're against it. I don't think that's why the people of this province sent us to this House.</p>
<p>I would hope that at the end of the day this bill, as it stands now, I hope I'm proven wrong, that it is the best that Nova Scotians do realize some of these energy efficiencies and this is the best way to deliver it, but I'm not convinced of it. I think as I said earlier, the things you do - it's not done with malice, it's done with very good intent, but you find out it's just not workable. Nova Scotia Power's perspective on the world is a lot different, and their perspective on the province from time to time is a lot different than what your government's may be.</p>
<p>The wants and the needs of Nova Scotia Power aren't necessarily the wants and the needs of Nova Scotians, so I would hope that the minister - I know the minister understands that and I think he agrees with me. This will be borne out in time.</p>
<p>Our government, the previous government, I can go back to a time in the 1970s where you think that talking about Nova Scotia Power - you think Nova Scotia Power is an issue that's inflammatory in this Chamber today, I can remember a time when it garnered a guy, who was representing the riding I'm in, to walk across the floor and persuade someone with his five fingers clutched as a fist. So it's nothing new to have disagreements over Nova Scotia Power - and it brings out a lot of interest in everybody.</p>
<p>It's April 29<sup>th</sup> today, and we're still seeing people going up and down Granville and Hollis with scarves on, so it means that energy consumption in our homes is probably greater than normal - it's probably at a time where it should be early March-type consumptions that we are probably consuming this time of year. That will be interesting to look at.</p>
<p>One would like to see Bill No. 41 alleviate that, but the reality is, and the minister knows this, and there's no magic wand here, there's no magic, this is going to be it - there will be another bill, another government, another generation and I'm sure they'll still be talking about how we're doing these things. I just hope that when we finally get to it that this bill has not hurt the situation. I believe we'll be voting against it, but it's a strange thing, it's like you vote against it and you hope for it. That's the reality of it; that's what we do in here.</p>
<p>We have a uniqueness here and it's a balance, we're dealing with a monopoly. We're dealing with a monopoly that was once owned directly by the people of Nova Scotia. I suppose if we ever tried to open that can of worms, it would be an interesting one - much like putting the toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<p>I can also remember, in the world of evolution, in the 1970s again, where were we? The striking thing that was bringing down governments was the cost of fuel on the international market. That was the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was much the reason that new mines were opened in Cape Breton. We started burning Cape Breton coal again, that was just the reality of it. Nobody was around then to really talk about the effects of it. At that reality it was one or the other. It was either import Bunker C offshore or burn our own coal. There is a whole lesson to be talked about there - while doing that, did we ever really give ourselves the proper return on that and so on? But so be it; that was then.</p>
<p>You cannot live life, you cannot do negotiations, you can't do any of those things in the rear-view mirror, I'd say. We've got to go forward. This bill, while I can't say it's a terrible bill, but I can't support it because I know it doesn't do what the government had said it would do during the election. Therefore, with a few more words that I was going to say about this bill - and maybe the minister will have a few more to say before he sits down - I will take my place and thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#5d4cd4b5-5ca2-425c-82a5-49a49892eee6"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm just going to make a few comments. My colleagues across the floor had some comments related to the bill and some of the broader issues too. I think the broader issues are important and I think the out-sourcing issue in particular is as much a strain on the families of people who don't know whether they are going to be out-sourced or not, as it is on anything else, and we'll see where that goes. I have my own opinions on where it might go, but they're probably, on that particular issue, as good as anybody else's opinion in here and my understanding is in the next few months we might have some certainty on when, if, and how much - all that sort of thing happens.</p>
<p>It's worth noting - the member for Cape Breton Centre brought up Canso and talked about depots. Of course there weren't any Nova Scotia Power depots because Canso has its own utility. I only mention that because I think it's a common misconception in the province that the whole province is Nova Scotia Power when, in fact, Canso and Berwick and a number of others actually have their own municipal utilities. Interestingly enough in, I believe, all of those cases, they pay less in those municipal utilities than you pay for power as a Nova Scotia Power customer.</p>
<p>Now, there are some reasons for that in some cases, but it is also an example in Berwick where they've made use of the renewable-to-retail. This debate in some respects reminds me of the debate we had in the Fall session when we brought forward the legislation on renewable-to-retail. One of the things that was said at the time by - I think it might have been the member for Argyle-Barrington who said we'll see what happens, whether anybody signs up, and of course, already, without the regulations in place, there are companies coming forward and municipalities coming forward, looking to take advantage of that bill. So here we are, four months later and yes, what we predicted would happen, with interest being shown, is happening.</p>
<p>I know that with the electricity stuff, it can take some time. It's why we - the member for Cape Breton Centre talked about going back to the 1970s. I was born in the 1970s so I don't remember that, the oil crisis, but what I will say is that (Interruptions) We have many decades represented in the Legislature. What I will say about that is that we can go back even further and look at before Nova Scotia Power was a company owned by the government, it was a whole bunch of private utilities, at one time, and it has gone through a number of different versions of this: Nova Scotia Light and Power, of course; the Bowater Assets; the hydro dams were built for the purpose of being run by the mill down there and so forth. There is a lot of unique history here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>To answer the member for Cape Breton Centre's question about power usage recently with the cold weather, well, he's absolutely right. They had to bring back an unused unit in Lingan two days ago. In fact, they had to bring down power at a number of our interruptable users this week for that very reason, because they suddenly had to fire up one of the units that has been down all winter at Lingan because power usage was so low, because it got so cold at the end of April, totally unpredicted.</p>
<p>We can't predict weather, weather has changed and so our usage patterns - all you need to do is look around not only Halifax but a number of other cities to see that many homes and apartment buildings and condominiums are now being built with air conditioning loads. Well, we never had high summer loads before and now we're starting to even out that load where things like solar energy may become more valuable. Those are all the sorts of issues that are being looked at as part of the electricity review. There's already a lot of interest so we'll have more to say on that later.</p>
<p>On this specific issue, we came into government and there were changes that needed to be made regardless of who came in. The HST issue was a $4.7 million annual weight around the necks of ratepayers in this province. The structure of the corporation had to be changed. We talk about unintended consequences and there was one that I don't think anybody intended when the original Efficiency Nova Scotia Corporation was introduced. We have restructured it, ratepayers will now not be paying for that amount of money - never, they will never see that charge.</p>
<p>We took low-income programs and Nova Scotia Power is now paying the electricity programs for low income, which will mean that every single low-income home in this province will be upgraded over a maximum of 10 years, so maybe it will get done faster, but in 10 years, at a maximum of 10 years, every low-income electrically heated home in this province will be upgraded at no charge to those homeowners. The province is matching that on the non-electric side, to ensure that every non-electric heated home in this province is fully upgraded. Those retrofits and upgrades will start this summer. In fact, the program details are already being rolled out.</p>
<p>We also looked at the need to move in a direction that is supported by stakeholders. One of the things that we committed to during the election was not only to get the tax off bills, which will happen on January 1<sup>st</sup>, but also to work with stakeholders on the mechanism and the things that they needed addressed, and we did. You heard stakeholders coming here and speak in the media and say that this is even better than what was committed because of the things that it does, the competition it creates.</p>
<p>We had the letter from the Suzuki Foundation, the Pembina Institute, Ecology Action Centre, and numerous others that talked about how this goes even further and in better ways than what we had committed to and creates a long-term, strong program for efficiency in this province. That is what we committed that we would do and we will.</p>
<p>This bill is one portion of the overall efficiency program that we promised to deliver on. Mr. Speaker, this part of the bill, this bill is about whether you want to see power rates go down on January 1, 2015, or you don't and that is a very simple choice. On January 1, 2015, Nova Scotians will look and decide who felt that power rates should go down and who thought they should increase. The reality is the proposal going to the board if this bill didn't pass, was for a rate increase by Efficiency Nova Scotia for next year. So there's the choice.</p>
<p>Tonight's bill is a very simple choice: it's do you think rates should go down on January 1<sup>st</sup>, or do you think they should go up? Thank you very much.</p></speech>

<p>There is no question, Mr. Speaker, there are opportunities in the skilled trades here and we want our sons and daughters to take advantage of them, and that's why we're making changes to the Apprenticeship and Trades Qualifications Act and the Community Colleges Act. These amendments lay the groundwork to establish a new industry-led agency for apprenticeship. This is a direct response to a recommendation made by industry experts that will give them more authority and decision-making power across the entire apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Cape Breton Centre for his part in moving this bill along to its fruition since - I know he's crying over there, but despite that I do want to commend him for his part in making this bill a reality.</p>
<p>The result, Mr. Speaker, will be a system that is more responsive to the people it's intended to serve - employers and apprentices. It will also encourage employer participation which will provide more opportunities for apprentices and help them complete their training, and it will work to attract more people to careers in the skilled trades.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, changes to the Community Colleges Act will ensure students are getting the training they need to prepare for these and other jobs across the province. Included in this year's budget was $2.6 million to support this work, expand apprenticeship technological training, and create new supports for employers. Under this legislation we will now be able to issue cease and desist orders in cases where someone is working in a trade without the required certification, or as a non-registered apprentice, and this will help to ensure a fair playing field for our employers and a safe work environment for all.</p>
<p>We will now also have the ability to assign apprenticeship agreements to employers in other jurisdictions, making it easier for apprentices to have out-of-province training recognized and they'll be able to complete their program without interruption. Mr. Speaker, a successful apprenticeship system means more jobs for our daughters and sons, and it means bringing our young workers home and making home the best place to work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to move third reading of Bill No. 45. Thank you.</p></speech>

First of all, I would just like to speak briefly to the amendment to Bill No. 51. I noticed that amendment is very similar to Bill No. 29 that I introduced in the last session. I would like to thank the minister for the support for that amendment. I notice in that amendment that it is with consent of the minister that the village may sell or lease property at less than market value to a non-profit organization, that the village commission is considered to be carrying on an activity that is beneficial to the village.</p>
<p>That was the intent of Bill No. 29, Mr. Speaker, that villages have the opportunity to donate land to organizations and this comes out of an incident which happened in Kings County where the Village of New Minas wanted to donate land to Habitat for Humanity and eventually discovered that they were unable to do that due to a missing part of the Municipal Government Act, something that if they had been a town they would have been able to do but as a village they were unable to address.</p>
<p>Habitat for Humanity does terrific work. The house that Habitat for Humanity wanted to build was built; it was built on land donated by the Town of Kentville in the Municipality of Kings County. The unfortunate part of that is that the family that Habitat for Humanity was building the house for in New Minas was not able to travel, did not have the opportunity - the house being further away, they were not able to access that to work because they did not have transportation.</p>
<p>The bill addresses something that is important to organizations like Habitat for Humanity that they can access land from villages. As you know we have some 21 or 22 villages in the province and it's something that is important for them to have. As far as the remainder of the bill, the ability to meet in camera, this comes out of a big lack in a village's ability to operate. It's very important that they have this ability and I would like to commend the minister on bringing that forward.</p>
<p>I noticed that there was - and I'm sure the minister is familiar with this - the Village Legislation Discussion Paper, revised September 22, 2012, from the Association of Nova Scotia Villages, there were 14 proposals in that paper, number 11 of which was this in camera.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying that I support, or that the minister should support, all 14 of those proposals, but I think that the minister needs to look at them and think about some of those, certainly some of the things that the villages need to do.</p>
<p>We are living in a time when municipal governance and municipalities and all that is a big issue now in towns, with towns going through the process of amalgamation and municipal amalgamation. What is the importance of villages? Well, I would like to suggest to you that villages are important, that they are very effective and efficient, in many cases run largely by volunteers, and are able to be very effective. Maybe we are headed for amalgamation of villages and towns and municipalities, but the sunset on villages, I am certain, will take a long time and villages will continue to exist in our province for quite some time.</p>
<p>It is important that we, as a government, give them the tools that they need to function effectively, and this bill gives them some of the tools that they need to function effectively. With that, I would like to conclude my remarks on Bill No. 51.</p></speech>

KEITH IRVING</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to Bill No. 51 and specifically to the amendments that were brought forward on Bill No. 51. As the honourable member across spoke about, the village commissions, through legislation, are required to lease or sell or donate land to non-profit organizations at fair market value. There are situations where this is a disadvantage for a village looking to work with a non-profit group. The member opposite raised the issue in my constituency of New Minas, where this became an issue.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out, in my experience on two municipal councils, that the issues of affordable housing are paramount in communities, particularly small communities in Nova Scotia. Councils are always looking for ways to assist in the development of affordable housing, and there are very, very few tools for municipalities, towns, villages to actually contribute to creating affordable housing. They have solely the ability to legislate land-use planning, but the other tool they have is through the donation of municipal land or assets. It is really organizations like Habitat for Humanity that will benefit from the ability for all municipalities and municipal units, including villages, to be able to donate land to non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>I happened to attend the cutting of the ribbon for the Habitat for Humanity opening of a duplex in Wolfville. It is a very moving experience to see two single moms with their young kids standing beside them and to be proudly accepting the keys and proudly announcing to the community that they are delighted; they never thought that they would have an opportunity to have a mortgage. I thought that was a very profound statement, and it's really a testament to the great work of Habitat for Humanity.</p>
<p>These changes will have a positive impact for not-for-profit groups that are looking to acquire land for projects that will benefit their community. With the amendments to this bill, we are increasing the ability for villages to respond to the needs of non-profit organizations and their community members.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to wholeheartedly thank the member for Kings North for bringing this amendment forward and also thank the minister for his work on this bill. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>I'm not going to speak much today. I've had many opportunities in the Legislature to talk about u-vints, but as the members know, I introduced a similar bill six times when I was in Opposition. It gives me a great deal of pleasure today to see the bill coming here to third reading and about to become law.</p>
<p>With the passage of this bill, Mr. Speaker, we will be able to go forward and actually write the regulations that will accompany the bill. We're going to include more consultation with the industry as we do that. We want to make sure that the regulations are going to be our own Nova Scotia regulations - we're not using any other model to do so, and therefore it will require some consultation.</p>
<p>I appreciated the comments on second reading that came from members of the Opposition in support of this bill. I think that it's a change in our province whose time has come. The public were ahead of us on this for the last number of years, and as I say, I'm very pleased to see third reading of Bill No. 52. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e823bcda-8e9b-4fde-a6bc-c84c2ae48f5c"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>I would like to speak against this bill for several reasons. First of all, I think that we have in our province a grape industry and a winery industry that is just starting to really get going, and I question the impact that u-vints will have on that winery industry. What will happen is that the brewing that is done in the u-vints will result in a $3 bottle of wine, and at that low price I'm afraid it will impact the grape and wine industry, the wineries that we have in the province.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the concentrate that is put in those u-vints comes from very low-cost producing parts of the world, in countries like Mexico or Chile. The fact of the matter is that the world is awash with grape juice, and there is overproduction everywhere at the moment. In fact, in France there have been 700-year-old vineyards that have been torn out, and the reason is because of the growth of local wine.</p>
<p>What the minister is doing is creating a stream of grape juice turned into wine in our province, which is essentially offshore grapes, offshore production. I think it will impact our local wineries, and I would encourage the minister, when you're looking at the pricing on these products, that you look at and consult with the wineries.</p>
<p>The second reason I'd like to speak against it is that we have a long history of taxation of alcohol, and again, I would question the fact that we would bring a stream of alcohol into the province that is brewed in this way which does not attract that same level of taxation. I would question the fairness of that to our - and I know nobody would, it's hard to defend big corporations, but the big corporations that do produce alcohol and put it in the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation have a right to be in a fair playing field. I would question the fairness of that, that another stream of alcohol is being brought into the province at very low cost, and is not attracting the same level of taxation that the big brewers, the big wine companies, are in the regime that they are living in.</p>
<p>The third thing I would question is, again, the fairness of this legislation in regard to the hotel, restaurant, and bar industry, where they are required to buy alcohol from the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation at full price and attempt to sell it for a profit. Now, it may be that there is no limit to the amount of alcohol that can be consumed in the province, and possibly this will have no impact on their sales, but again, I would question the fairness of having such a low-cost product come into our hard-working restaurant and bars. I know from having relatives involved in that industry and having observed it, one of the most competitive and difficult industries to stay on top of is the restaurant business. One of the key factors in their success is alcohol sales and to have such low-cost product available in the province is something that I would question the wisdom of. I would ask the minister again to consider that issue.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say that I know the minister may be aware there was a book written recently called <i>Drink -</i> and I don't know the name of the author, but it was a lady who was a successful executive - about the perils of alcoholism. Again, I would question the sensibility of having such a low-cost stream of alcohol brought into the province, from social issues. I know the minister has said that she does not believe that is an issue, but I question that.</p>
<p>On those multiple issues, I think that this legislation needs to be carefully thought about. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#331409ea-d1b7-4360-84de-bcaf1d09e73d"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to make a few brief comments. I know, especially after the comments from the minister on third reading of Bill No. 52, she had mentioned that there will be continued consultation as the regulations are created for this piece of legislation. I would hope and I would encourage - and I look hopefully to support from this recommendation from the Minister of Health and Wellness - that the minister look at consultation with those professionals who have worked their whole career in public health, and similar to some of the comments from the previous speaker, that there is an impact on society when there is access to a lower-cost alcohol.</p>
<p>I know my Leader spoke at length at second reading around the socially responsible pricing of alcohol. This is something, nationally, that jurisdictions from one end of this country to the other look at and take action on. Mr. Speaker, we know for example that here in our own capital city, over the last number of years, where bar owners, for example, have come together to try to curb some of the issues we've had, especially around violence after hours or when the bars close here in Halifax, and that there is a relation to the price of alcohol.</p>
<p>I know many of the bars here in Halifax had $1.00 drinks, for example, and we know - it is documented - there have been issues in the province. Now don't get me wrong, Mr. Speaker, when I was going to Saint Mary's here in Halifax, those cheap prices were great, but as you realize the importance of having a good pricing of alcohol, there are ramifications if they are too low.</p>
<p>All I'm asking from the minister is that if consultation is going to continue, that there is an opportunity for those who work within public health, who have concerns around pricing of alcohol here in the province, that they are given another opportunity to have some input to the regulations that will be created after Bill No. 52 is passed through the Legislature.

          <speech by="#58b01541-6697-4dbd-830c-6cec0d4c4825"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the other members who have spoken. I wanted to make a few comments about what we've heard here from the Opposition. First of all, in our original consultation we did have input from the wine industry. Nova Scotia's wine industry is in no way threatened by the access to u-vint operations. They are outselling everything they make. The entire production is sold. There isn't enough to export at this point because it's all absorbed and sold here in Nova Scotia. People are appreciating the wine industry.</p>
<p>I've had the opportunity to speak at some length with the Minister of Agriculture who is very anxious to see more grapes planted, to see an expansion of the industry and the farm side of this industry and the local wineries that are particularly in the Annapolis Valley. We see no conflict whatsoever with the expansion of u-vint operations that are available now in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We certainly will watch that but right now I can assure Nova Scotians that the wine industry is thriving and growing and the demand for good quality Nova Scotia wines is increasing. They are working very closely and in consultation with the NSLC, which I am the minister for, in terms of having very good placement in the stores and all we can do to support our local wine industry.</p>
<p>In fact, Nova Scotia wines outsold a number of wine countries like France and Chile as well this year - I'm sure it was Chile - it was something like the fifth largest jurisdiction for sales of wine and that was our own Nova Scotia wine. As the member would know, certain brands and names of wines sell out completely and we can't get them as the year progresses.</p>
<p>I have no qualms and no worries about the impact on our local wines. I do feel that we had good consultation with the wine industry, and that there was some input received. I appreciate that you've raised that as a concern, as a person from the Valley and also a farmer. I'm sure you're very well aware of that, but I want to assure you that the discussions have taken place with the industry and with the Minister of Agriculture.</p>
<p>On the taxation of alcohol, I would say that the previous way the wine kit stores operated, there was no tax paid on the sale of the kits because the kits are considered a food product, so they are exempt from tax. As it stands now, there will be tax paid on the service, as the wine and beer is brewed on-site and there's a tax on that. So there's additional tax revenue to the province as a result of the expansion of the service. I think that's important and, more importantly, the extension of more people working in the industry, more people are employed paying taxes - an expansion of the industry is good on that small business entrepreneurial level. We will be supporting that as it goes forward. It's already been pretty phenomenal.</p>
<p>In talking about the licensees, it's important to note that NSLC in the last year has offered a 10 per cent discount to licensees on both wine and spirits - not on beer - but we were the first jurisdiction in Canada to do that, and that was a big concession to recognizing the stress that a lot of restaurateurs and bars and licensed establishments are under. We understand there has been a lot of pressure on those businesses and it was a way to try a pilot that would perhaps help them - that should be noted here today that we have recognized those pressures.</p>
<p>I don't see a u-vint operation, where you don't get access or you don't get to bottle and have your wine for many weeks, you've got to leave it in the store, I don't really see that's going to be an impediment or in any way competitive to going out to dinner and having a glass of wine while you're at dinner. I want to recognize that NSLC did take a step which cuts into the revenue that comes to the province, but it was a step to recognize the importance of the food and beverage industry. So that was also done.</p>
<p>In response to the member for Sackville-Cobequid, I just want to say that as we go forward we will certainly be monitoring. I will commit that we will evaluate the success of the u-vint operation as it goes forward, like any other bill and any other activity that government undertakes. If something were to be identified later that was problematic, we could certainly review it then. I will reiterate that I don't see this as a harmful activity.</p>
<p>I'd also take a little bit of exception to the price that was quoted by the member from the Annapolis Valley - the member for Kings North. The reason I say that is I don't think there's anywhere that you would get a $3 bottle of wine through this process. It's inexpensive, but it is not that inexpensive. I don't know where you got the figure of $3. I've heard, I think, something like $8 perhaps per bottle. That's quite a difference; it's more than 100 per cent more than what you said. So I just want to say that would be unbelievably inexpensive, which is not the case. Bear in mind that the individuals themselves actually make this wine - they take the effort, their time, and their supplies to make and bottle and prepare the wine, so it isn't as though you're buying a ready-made product like that at that price.</p>
<p>I've said before, it's a hobby and I think that any of us would note that the people of Nova Scotia have led the way on this. We've had a couple of courageous people in the industry who have stood up and asked us to review the processes in Nova Scotia, and I think this is a very good day for entrepreneurs in Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p></speech>

TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise tonight and talk about this important issue of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia. There has been a lot of talk about Lyme disease in this Chamber over the years and even over this session. Talk is important because it brings attention to something that is important to Nova Scotians, but what Nova Scotians really want from this Chamber is action.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe, but there are those among us who feel like Lyme disease is not an issue in this province. There are members in this Chamber who feel that Lyme disease is not an important issue that warrants discussion in this Chamber. I am not one of them. The members of the PC caucus are not amongst those members who feel that there is nothing to worry about here. There's nothing to see, move along, some members would say - but not us over here.</p>
<p>Maybe members in here who would say, there is legislation in place already, there is nothing more we can do. To them I say, not so. Any legislation that may be on the books is clearly not working. So I ask, why are we so reluctant to look for a better way? We should always look for a better way, and I hope that someday the members on the government side will come to realize that a better way may come from this side. There can be good ideas that come from the Opposition side.</p>
<p>Lyme disease is a problem in Nova Scotia. We were all sent here by our constituents to try to solve problems that are important to Nova Scotians. I can tell you that I have heard from Nova Scotians from all corners of our province who have been touched by Lyme disease - all corners. If you are a member sitting in this Chamber and you think that your constituents don't care about Lyme disease, you are wrong. If you are a member sitting in this Chamber and you think that there is no issue, you are wrong.</p>
<p>We, as a province, have a chance to be a leader and we should take it. We should make sure that our medical system is properly prepared to diagnose and treat Lyme disease. Yes, prevention is always part of the solution, but in those cases where prevention fails, we need to have a system that is properly prepared to address it.</p>
<p>In a minute I'm going to share some stories from people throughout Nova Scotia who are dealing with Lyme disease and/or other tick-borne diseases. I'm going to share their stories in their own words, and I beg the members of this Chamber to listen to these stories or maybe go back through Hansard on another day and read a few of them because all these stories are different, yet they are all the same. They are from all over the province, not just the endemic areas.</p>
<p>The issue is greater than anyone realizes and more research and education is required. Madam Speaker, what time did we start late debate?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#31fb4530-6a1c-46f4-970e-db00638ac010"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>I'll share the first story here. A family wrote in:</p>
<blockquote>My daughter moved from Saskatchewan to Halifax to play basketball for the Dalhousie Tigers in 2009. She got sick in her first year and several doctors thought it was H1N1, that was currently in an outbreak at that time. She did not get better so she was prescribed anti-viral medication. She was then eventually referred to an Internist who grilled her on what street drugs she was taking. She has since developed a cardiac problem and had a very irregular heartbeat so she was sent for an ECG. She ultimately had extreme headaches and joint pain, light sensitivity, numbness in extremities. </blockquote>
<p>One of the doctors in Halifax told her she must be homesick. When she returned to Saskatchewan for Christmas break she went to see a South African doctor in Saskatchewan who immediately treated her for Lyme disease. She took a couple of courses of antibiotics before she headed back to school in January but after getting here, she went to seek out a Lyme-literate doctor and she had trouble because it is a fact that we have difficulty finding doctors in Nova Scotia who know much about Lyme disease and this young lady was encountering just that.</p>
<p>She looked around for a Lyme-literate doctor. She did ultimately find one in Cape Breton who reviewed her case and figured out a treatment plan. She began to see small improvements. Now remember, this was a girl who arrived in Halifax at the end of August, a healthy athlete, who regularly ran five kilometres and trained on the basketball court several times a week, but yet by Halloween she was unable to walk up a flight of stairs and she spent most of her waking hours in a dark room.</p>
<p>She ultimately made it through and got her degree in convocation in the Spring, but after two full years of antibiotics and more than two years of herbal supplements, she is only now just returning to training and once again finding the energy to work. This is a classic case of people not finding the appropriate diagnosis and immediate treatment.</p>
<p>The next says:</p>
<blockquote>My story is absolutely typical of hundreds and hundreds of other Nova Scotians who have contracted Lyme disease. As a point of interest, I will mention that after two years of being sick and struggling to find answers and get a diagnosis and get help and treatment, finally on my own I realized that it was Lyme disease that I had. I went to our family veterinarian - the family vet - in the absence of finding a doctor that could help. The family vet provided some advice, immediate straight forward advice: go to the US as fast as you can. You will get diagnosed and treated there, but you will not get it here. </blockquote>
<p>That was an honest example, she said, and the results showed that advice was good. Meanwhile the family medical doctor of 25 years failed to give good advice and continuously denied that this person had Lyme disease, and this is a story that's typical of many Nova Scotians. Sadly that is the reality for many Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I'm going to find one here in the interest of time here. A gentleman writes in:</p>
<blockquote>I was finally properly diagnosed in February 2010 with Lyme disease after having been bit by a tick in the summer of 1971. This summer makes it 42 years - yes, I said that right - 42 years of relentless pain, fatigue, muscle stiffness, probably about 50 other symptoms. </blockquote>
<p>There are many stories here that I would love to touch on but many of them are about being bit by ticks in different stages of their life cycles and some of the stories are written by people who said they didn't even notice that they were bitten by a tick because the tick was so small.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous situation in this province. We do have an issue in this province and we do need to support our medical community as it tries to prepares itself to properly address the issue that we have. It's not fair to say pull your socks up higher when you go in the woods. It's not fair to say check yourself when you come out. We need to provide a system so that doctors know what to do when somebody presents themselves, having been bit by a tick. There has to be a protocol that doctors say, well this is what I will do because you showed up like this. We don't have that at the moment; we need to get there. In other jurisdictions they are starting to get there. We have a chance to be a leader.</p>
<p>My only question for the government side is, can we find the courage to acknowledge this issue and try to solve this issue before countless more families have to suffer through what people with Lyme disease are currently suffering through? We have people who are being told, well we'll send your son or daughter to a psychiatrist because there must be something wrong with them because they have so many different symptoms that they just can't be real. We can't accept that, I don't accept that and I hope that the government doesn't accept that, thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#88604b47-cbb6-4926-a8e6-0437792dd939"><from>MS. JOYCE TREEN</from><p>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak about Lyme disease. At this time of year the weather is usually warming up, although Mother Nature doesn't seem to be cooperating right now, but when this weather does warm up and when the snow has completely melted everywhere, and when the temperature is consistently above four degrees Celsius, it is tick season in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>As we all know, blacklegged ticks can carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease and that is why May is the month that has been chosen for Lyme disease awareness. In fact, in two days we will be proclaiming May as Lyme Disease Awareness Month in Nova Scotia, and I will come back to that in a moment, but first I want say that we share the concerns of Nova Scotians and the members of this House about Lyme disease in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>A certain amount of concern is justified. The tick population in Nova Scotia has grown significantly from zero endemic areas in the province to six in the past 11 years, and there are certainly no grounds to suggest that the government is doing nothing about Lyme disease in this province.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, government began taking action long ago. I want to reassure the members of this House and all Nova Scotians that there is a great deal of attention being devoted to Lyme disease, both in this province and at the national level.</p>
<p>Over the past dozen years we have been monitoring the tick population and the incidence of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia and taking the appropriate action to keep Nova Scotians as safe as possible. Let me go through these actions one by one.</p>
<p>In response to Lyme disease in Nova Scotia, the Department of Health and Wellness developed a Vector Borne Diseases Working Group with representation from the province's Departments of Health and Wellness, Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Environment; the Public Health Agency of Canada and the National Microbiology Lab; public health staff in district health authorities; the Provincial Public Health Network Anchor Laboratory; the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History; and the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch.</p>
<p>This group developed the Tick Borne Diseases Response Plan and updates it regularly to keep it current. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to table the most recent version of that plan. The plan includes human surveillance for Lyme disease, tick surveillance, public awareness education campaign, information for health professionals, diagnostic testing for human illness, and vector control measures.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, you will note that these actions in government's plan include a surveillance program, guidelines for diagnosis and treatment, and education materials for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I'd like to provide a little more detail about the government's work on each of these actions. In terms of surveillance, Nova Scotia has added Lyme disease to this legislative list of notifiable diseases and works with health professionals across the province to track instances of the disease. We also work with our colleagues in the Department of Natural Resources and the Public Health Agencies of Canada to monitor the tick population, which, as I noted, has grown significantly in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The knowledge gained through surveillance is compiled by the Department of Health and Wellness in an annual Report on <i>Lyme Disease Epidemiology and Surveillance in Nova Scotia</i>. I will happily table the most recent report.</p></speech>

            <p>Nothing to see, no problem, no Lyme disease in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <speech by="#88604b47-cbb6-4926-a8e6-0437792dd939"><from>MS. TREEN</from><p>That's not what was said. Nobody said that, so stop saying it, please.</p>
<p>The members of this House and all Nova Scotians can find this very thorough report on the Department of Health and Wellness website. We also distribute it to the health professionals in Nova Scotia and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Nova Scotia also has an Infectious Disease Expert Group in Nova Scotia that has produced a <i>Statement for Managing Lyme Disease in Nova Scotia</i>. This statement has been distributed to physicians and other professionals throughout the health system and is posted on our website. Madam Speaker, I have that statement to table as well.</p>
<p>We continue to work with infectious disease specialists to hold webinars and other forms of medical education for physicians. We also submit an annual article about Lyme disease for the Spring edition of <i>Doctors Nova Scotia Magazine</i> to ensure the province's health professionals have the most recent research at their disposal.</p>
<p>The laboratory at the QEII hospital works with the national lab in Winnipeg, using the accepted two-step testing protocol. Any diagnosis not using this method - as is being done by private labs in the U.S. - is questionable.</p>
<p>In addition to the information for health professionals, we also put a strong focus on public education, because Lyme disease is entirely preventable with some simple precautions.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, we recognize May as Lyme Disease Awareness Month in Nova Scotia. We look forward to bringing that resolution to the floor in this House. During this month, we will start our annual campaign with a news release, advertising posters, pamphlets, and information for all our MLAs' offices to remind Nova Scotians of these preventive measures. Be mindful of ticks when working or playing in grassy, shrubby, and wooded areas. Wear light-coloured long sleeved shirts and pants so ticks are more visible, light-coloured socks and enclosed shoes. Pull socks up over your pants and tuck in shirts. Spray clothing and exposed skin with an insect repellent containing DEET, following manufacturer's instructions. Check clothing and exposed skin for ticks after working or playing outside or in the bushes or tall grass. Removing any ticks attached to the skin - this is described in the posters, the pamphlets, and on the website on how to do this. Keep grass cut to minimize suitable habitat for the ticks on properties.</p>
<p>We advise anyone who has been exposed to the outdoors and developed symptoms of Lyme disease to seek medical attention. One early symptom is a bull's eye-shaped rash around the tick bite. That can be accompanied by other symptoms like fever, fatigue, muscle ache, joint pain, and headache. I have copies of the pamphlets and posters here to be tabled, as well as last year's advertising and the information posted on the website.</p>
<p>This year, we will also be stepping up our efforts with social media to share all the simple precautions I have just listed and other information to help Nova Scotians understand ticks, Lyme disease, and how to protect themselves from it. We will also be working more closely with our federal and provincial colleagues on coordinating efforts to educate the public and continue providing new information to health professionals. Nova Scotia's participation in a national vector-borne working group that developed a national communication plan reflecting Lyme disease activities across the country and sowing the seeds for more collaboration among these partners. In fact, Nova Scotia co-chairs this group along with the Public Health Agency of Canada. I have a copy of the national communication plan to table. I have noted the information on our website &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>The honourable member for Pictou West.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6a90d53e-7f2d-4189-b7bd-c98709dcee16"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm not as well versed on this topic as my colleague, the member for Pictou East, but I just want to share some personal stories and experiences. My first experience with Lyme disease was actually in the late 1980s when I was going to university in Maine and one of the students there was diagnosed. It took years and years to be diagnosed, and what I'll bet we'll find in 10 years from now is that some of us will maybe be sitting here and that we'll be adapting the rules and regulations of what the State of Maine and other states are doing.</p>
<p>I really believe that the Province of Nova Scotia is behind when it comes to a Lyme disease strategy. There's no doubt that we're way behind. We know that Lyme disease is on the rise in Canada - I think it's up by 146 per cent. I know that in Nova Scotia it's on the rise because I'm seeing it in my own area.</p>
<p>What we don't realize, and I just recently learned myself, is that Lyme disease is increasing along with - and I know some of you may not believe this - but they indicate that it's increasing with climate change. I would just like to see Nova Scotia, for once, get ahead and on top of something. I really, really believe that we will be, in 10 years, up to par where Maine is now, where they wished they had been back in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>I have a good friend, Brenda Sterling-Goodwin - who was here one day in a wheelchair - and I've spent a lot of time with her and lots of conversations. I've spoken to a number of people that have been finally diagnosed. I don't tend to disagree with the fact that we have a number out there that states that, okay, there were maybe six this year in Nova Scotia that were diagnosed; the problem is that it could be someone in this room. We're not able to diagnose it easily and this Lyme Disease Strategy would allow doctors and the medical profession to tap into having better tests out there. We know that there are a lot of different strains of Lyme disease.</p>
<p>My closest experience, most recently, with Lyme disease is my sister-in-law who is a nurse in the State of Maine. A year ago this summer she had been out walking with my brother and her son and she found a tick in her groin, and they couldn't get it out with tweezers in their own house. In the State of Maine they are always preparing people with what to do in those situations, so they went to the hospital and it took two people working on her; it was that far embedded down. It took two people to get it out and they put her on antibiotics right away, which they say fine, get you on antibiotics right away and you'll be fine, but now in the State of Maine what they do is you're not fine right away. She was home this weekend visiting me and she was telling me that next month, or July I guess it would be, a year after they found it, they still do a follow-up test to ensure that there are no after-effects and that she is totally clean.</p>
<p>Here we have the State of Maine, back in the 1980s a student, a friend of mine, took years to be diagnosed, went through those battery of tests, the same as the member for Pictou East explained about: do you have a tumour? Do you have MS? Do you have - you know, it must be in your head. How often do people hear that? It's the same thing with mental illness, how often do you hear?</p>
<p>I really hope that all of us here will really consider this bill. I hope that everyone will go home tonight, do a little bit more investigating, and ask around because it's out there more than people think, maybe even going home and googling Bill No. C-442, the National Lyme Disease Strategy by Elizabeth May. I think we have a lot to learn by this and it think it would be really awesome if we saw Elizabeth May, on a national level, passing this bill and then next in line is Nova Scotia. I mean how proud would that make everyone?</p>
<p>I just want to say, too, that Jim Wilson, who is the president for the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation, states right now that Canada is lagging far behind the U.S. in testing. We know that the tests in Canada and clinical exams are way too narrowly focused for what we're running in the wild, and as I speak about that I want everyone to realize, too, that we used to think the people getting ticks or Lyme disease were hikers, or woodsmen, people who are always out in the woods, and that's not the case at all. They're closer than what you think and I believe in all of the protection and being aware and you can do all the social media that you want to do, but until we put a strategy in place that is actually going to act on this problem, we've got nothing.</p>
<p>Awareness is one thing but acting on it is another thing. You know I always say when we know better, we do better, and we must do better in this situation and I also would like to address our pets. I spoke about my sister-in-law, who I'm sure is going to be fine, she doesn't seem to have any symptoms, but I'm glad she's getting the test in July to confirm that, but sadly, her dog has Lyme disease.</p>
<p>I just don't think that we should be as lax on this topic as we are. I hope once again that you'll all go home, that you'll do a little bit more investigating, and perhaps tomorrow morning you may have a different opinion and a different view on it. That's all I can ask of you and I thank you for letting me speak because I've really never got up and spoken without notes before, so thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#9d561239-9900-4212-aa2a-3392a94889e4"><from>MS. SUZANNE LOHNES-CROFT</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'd just like to add on to what my colleague has said about Lyme disease. Many of us in our caucus have been very concerned. I come from an area in Nova Scotia that has a pocket of Lyme disease, and it was one of the earliest places in Nova Scotia that was determined to have Lyme disease.</p>
<p>I think what we need to know is that our government, we've met with the Department of Health and Wellness, many of my colleagues and caucus, just even last week, and we went over what is being done by our Department of Health and Wellness regarding Lyme disease. We have been assured by our Department of Health and Wellness that they have a plan and a strategy, but it has to be an ongoing strategy because there is still research going on - the IWK is doing a research project.</p>
<p>I know it's a devastating disease. My father-in-law has it, and many friends of mine have had it, and many people in my community have had it, but I can assure you that the Department of Health and Wellness has a strategy, they have a plan and they are working on it, but it's an ongoing thing. The State of Maine has had Lyme disease long before Nova Scotia, so they would be ahead in their research. But we are working on it, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

Not to point fingers at anyone, I think it's the responsibility of all of us in this House to show leadership, and this is an occasion where we can with regard to Lyme disease in Nova Scotia. We know it's a problem, it has been a problem, the problem is going to increase and we have to have a strategy. We have to have it now, not later, in order to address this situation.</p>
<p>There are lots of examples across the province where people are suffering from Lyme disease. Again, I would like to see a strategy put in place and eventually doctors coming out of our medical schools with a lot of information and lot of expertise with regard to treating Lyme disease, because across the province right now, we have a lot of preventive things and everything else. But are you going to tell a three-year-old or a four-year-old in the middle of the summer, 32 degrees temperature, to &#x2026;</p></speech>
