<p>Whereas there are few people who will leave a mark as indelible on this earth as Nelson Mandela; and</p>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm very honoured that we have agreed, all of us, to just take a moment, each Party, to speak to the resolution before we pass it, which I'm sure we will unanimously in a moment. It is one of those times where we'll have one resolution and all Parties will express their views and then deal with the resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's rare in the world that the loss of one human being is marked pretty well unanimously by the rest of the six billion or seven billion of us, but today is one of those days. I can't think of an individual in my own lifetime where just about everyone on the planet feels some connection to another; in this case, Mr. Mandela of South Africa.</p>
<p>I was struck this morning by the tributes that are pouring in to Nelson Mandela's family from around the world, including everyday people in the millions, right up to the President of the United States - and the Prime Minister of Canada, of course - but Mr. Obama, the President, said that his first political action was to attend an anti-apartheid rally.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in no way am I comparing myself to the President of the United States, but the first political event I ever attended in my life as a young student at Dalhousie University was a Free Mandela concert at the Dalhousie Student Union Building in protest of the apartheid regime of South Africa, of the oppression of one people by another, and to demand that Mr. Mandela, who had stood up at great cost to his personal freedom, to say it was wrong, and to pledge himself, indeed his life, to fixing it was a big moment for a young Dalhousie student.</p>
<p>I know I speak for not only all of the Progressive Conservatives but all the people of Nova Scotia, as I'm sure the other Parties will, in recognizing that we have lost a man who not only put his life at risk but lost 27 years of his personal freedom in prison for his political beliefs, who then emerged from that famous jail cell to find a country divided and he sought to unite it; a country of racism, bigotry and oppression, and sought to end it; a country of great hardship and poverty and death and destruction, and healed it.</p>
<p>At the moment of his greatest power, when he could have turned on his own oppressors who literally had murdered his fellow citizens, he saw truth and reconciliation.</p>
<p>There is no greater symbol of hope for the world than what Nelson Mandela did for the hope for mankind.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to recognize that eternal truth, that one person, in this case Nelson Mandela, truly can make the world a better place. God rest his soul.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to lend our Party's voice to the many tributes, worldwide, to this great human being. In today's world the word hero is thrown around oh so quickly over some very minor matters but there is nobody I would think that would personify the definition of that word more than the late Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>We think of our own struggles within this House and in a very minute way, they are great for us, we feel the burden. I'm sure the government feels the burden of governing and we feel the burden of representation, as we all do in this House. When you think of the burden we share, the burden we put on our shoulders is so miniscule compared to the burden that was handed to Nelson Mandela and he gladly accepted it. He accepted it with such calm and dignity. I can never recall, whether it was an interview in the electronic media or whether it was in newspaper or whether it was a book about his life, that he ever complained.</p>
<p>Here we are today, a man of 95 years, who led a full life. Mr. Mandela not just led a full life, he led a great life. He led a life that lit the world. We will be ever grateful for that because now he is a man who belongs to the ages. He is a man who has transcended, I think, politics for the last half century. There is absolutely nobody who can put them in the category of a person who stood for their rights and stayed there and did it in such a perspective of the common man.</p>
<p>When he talked about sports and how they brought everything together, they brought both the sorrows and the joys, but they were the model of how we should do it. There have been stories about Mr. Mandela, who while in prison would organize football or soccer games, the greatness of the man when he brought rugby back to South Africa and he wore a Springbok jersey, these are the things that he had talked about; he would not just talk about what he had done.</p>
<p>I am going to take my place because in reality, anything I could say would be just pure hyperbole. He was a great man; he has transcended us all for years to come and I can only think he is, in my religious belief, somewhere looking down and smiling today saying, my work here is done, I will now rest. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>Whereas the Atlantic Jewish Council is committed to nurturing the quality of Jewish life in Atlantic Canada through community service, advocacy, and the promotion of interfaith dialogue and multiculturalism; and</p>
<p>Whereas Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorates the lives and heroism of those who perished amid the horrors of the Holocaust, and is solemnly marked each year by the Atlantic Jewish Council and caring communities around the world; and</p>
<p>Whereas tonight, April 8, 2013, the Atlantic Jewish Council will mark this year's Yom HaShoah with a public talk by Holocaust survivor Dr. Israel Unger, performances by students of the Asper Foundation Human Rights and Holocaust Studies program, and a memorial candle-lighting at Saint Mary's University;</p>

        <speech by="#578ba1c9-5f6c-4b7b-a5cd-b915e1801c37"><from>HON. LENA DIAB</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 14, amendments to the Justices of the Peace Act and Provincial Court Act, be now read a second time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to speak on a brief overview of this bill. The amendments being proposed result from a Nova Scotia Supreme Court decision delivered in February of this year. The court ruled that an independent process was needed to provide compensation for presiding Justices of the Peace in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice was given 12 months to make these changes. Mr. Speaker, we were of the impression that we were already providing fair and adequate compensation to our presiding Justices. However, the court disagreed. We all know that in a democratic society like ours, everyone has the right to make their case and the court has the ability to make an independent decision. In this case, the court ruled that a new compensation process is needed, and we accept that decision. By introducing these legislative changes, we are acting on that decision.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Justices of the Peace perform important tasks, like issuing warrants and emergency protection orders to free up judges' time. The court determined that a remuneration scheme must be introduced for presiding Justices of the Peace that meets constitutional requirements to protect independence.</p>
<p>This new legislation provides exactly that. It creates a new, independent process to set compensation for presiding Justices of the Peace. It is an objective, efficient, and fair process that creates a tribunal structure for determining compensation. To be more efficient, the chair of the judges compensation tribunal will also act as a one-person tribunal for the presiding Justices of the Peace.</p>
<p>We are recommending this tribunal model for a few reasons, Mr. Speaker. First, it is important to create a structure that is cost-effective and efficient. Second, there's a small number of presiding Justices of the Peace - there are only 13 part-time Justices of the Peace in the Province of Nova Scotia, and a one-person tribunal, the chair of the judges tribunal, who has already heard all of the common economic evidence; this is the most cost-efficient model reviewed. Finally, this model is also used in the Province of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>We are also introducing amendments to align the timing of salaries and benefits - tribunal reports for judges and presiding Justices of the Peace coinciding with government's budget preparation process. These amendments proposed that after an adjustment period, the reports will start at the beginning of the fiscal year following the year the report is submitted.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, the amendments brought forth today are the result of a Supreme Court of Nova Scotia decision to create an independent process to set compensation for presiding Justices of the Peace in Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p></speech>

ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Justices of the Peace are owed the same honour and consideration as our provincial judges, and as such, it is fitting that we afford them the same model for compensation. We rely on them to perform any duties, including issuing warrants, arraignment trials, issuing subpoenas, oaths of office, and performing civil weddings, to name a few. Without the hard work of these people, our justice system would not function as it does today. They provide professional consultation and are responsible for essential services.</p>
<p>In February, when the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruled that they be granted the same compensation model as provincial judges, it became apparent that this change needed to be made. Allowing compensation to be set by an independent board will ensure a transparent and fair process is put in place for these valuable civil servants.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we, the Progressive Conservative caucus, will be supporting this legislation. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for nearly a decade, my colleague, the honourable Minister of Finance and Treasury Board and the member for Clayton Park West, has lobbied for a holiday for Nova Scotians to enjoy in February. (Applause) The February Holiday Act delivers on our commitment to hard-working Nova Scotians, while giving businesses the time they need to plan for a new holiday. Nova Scotians have told us repeatedly that a mid-winter break is something they want; now we are able to make that happen. Nova Scotians deserve a break between New Year's Day and Easter.</p>
<p>I'm continuously inspired by the hard work, determination and optimism of the people of this province. Nova Scotians know how to work hard and at the same time they value family and community. The new statutory holiday will be marked on the third Monday beginning in February 2015. It will support that important work/life balance and it will give people time to spend with their families and friends, just as a majority of Canadians already do.</p>
<p>Now, you will notice the new holiday doesn't have a name yet. As promised, we'll reach out to young Nova Scotians to help decide what the February holiday should be called and we'll share more information on that process in the next couple of months. Six other provinces enjoy statutory holidays in February. Adding a February holiday will give Nova Scotia workers and families a total of six statutory holidays per year. Research shows that three-day weekends pay off with more productivity and less absenteeism.</p>
<p>Some businesses have already been giving their staff a break during the long winter months, businesses like MacLeod Lorway Financial Group, a local, family-run insurance brokerage. They have been a little ahead of the curve and they've been giving their 75 employees a day off in February for the past three years. They, like us, recognize a little time away can make for a much more productive time at work.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to move this legislation for second reading today.</p></speech>

            <p>No, you don't have to brace yourselves, folks. I see this as a progressive piece of legislation. I'm worried about some of the unintended consequences and I'm going to politely ask the government to make sure that they are considered. I'm not going to get into "the sky is falling" because Nova Scotians get a day off of work. (Applause) (Interruptions)</p>

          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>MR. CORBETT</from><p>Why thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is reasonable, but again all I want to do is caution the government. I know the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board has been - to say she was passionate about this would be putting it on the down side of it, and that's fine, but I would hope that the government really does genuinely spend the time between now and February 2015 to get it right, that small businesses in particular are protected by it. You know it's a statutory holiday; the idea that what this is going to impose on them is a burden.</p>
<p>I don't know what people will really do with this holiday. It's obviously in the middle of winter. I guess one good thing about it being in the middle of winter, people are not going to go far afield because of the weather, so it may mean on the upside - inasmuch as if they go somewhere - they'll spend money locally. That may be a good, unintended consequence.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our Party supports the working men and women of this province and, more importantly, the families, that they get to spend some time together. I would ask the government to be careful in crafting the regulations around this bill and to make sure that there's the least interruption done to the employers of this province around this bill.</p>
<p>I welcome this bill, I support this bill and to the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, a job well done. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I've been asked to be rather short in my remarks this morning and you can appreciate that that's difficult. (Interruption) I certainly want to thank the member opposite for his comments, I appreciate that very much and the acknowledgement that I have been working on this for a number of years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected 10 years ago to this House I had young children. I understand what it's like to have a busy life and juggle a lot of different things. I listened to my constituents; in fact, one of my constituents brought this idea to me in 2003. She said she had lived in Alberta where they have had it for over 20 years and what a wonderful thing it was.</p>
<p>Initially I thought this might be a lightweight sort of issue. I no longer think that because we have the fewest holidays of any jurisdiction in this country. Mr. Speaker, not the fewest by one or two but the fewest by a lot. We have five holidays and the average in the country is eight or more. Six provinces now have the February holiday. When I introduced the bill first, only one had it.</p>
<p>Other provinces see the benefit for a winter country to have a day off in the winter. Mr. Speaker, it's not only long and dreary, it's a time when we can get out and have fun with our families and get together and recharge our batteries.</p>
<p>I know that the member for Pictou West will be hearing from some of her constituents who will enjoy this, who will look forward to it. The public is in favour of it and more so as the years have gone by and they've realized that we have the fewest holidays in the country. That's just not a place we should be if we want to attract young people, keep our young people here in the province, be a competitive place to live. How long can we say what a great quality of life we have if we have no statutory holidays?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this has been supported a lot by the public but not only by the public but by progressive companies. More and more as other provinces have adopted a February holiday, companies that are working nationally have begun to give their people the day off here. Last February on that day I was interviewed by Global, which is part of the Shaw Communications Group, they were off across the country, they gave all their employees that day with only the skeleton staff at work that day, to keep the TV cameras rolling, but everybody would get a day off in lieu.</p>
<p>It's the trend, these companies are seeing it in their other offices across the country. I mentioned that in the U.S. it's a day where they are shut down across the country, it is Presidents Day; because of that, the stock markets are closed. When Ontario began to celebrate this day, the Ontario stock market closed. That means there is no business taking place in financial services across the country.</p>
<p>We've had support as well from companies like Beacon Securities, who said that for them it's just a day to catch up on paperwork. Many of their investment advisers and so on do not come to work that day because there's no trading, it's not happening. Again, more and more companies that are in business that want to call their suppliers in Ontario, Alberta, B.C., Manitoba, P.E.I. for heaven's sake - they all have that day off so business isn't happening if you're going to be talking to those provinces.</p>
<p>More and more, even regular, everyday Nova Scotians, are realizing that their families and friends who are living in Ontario or in Alberta, and the other provinces I named - six provinces in Canada that have that holiday - they're realizing they have the day off, they're having a long weekend or they're coming to visit here in Nova Scotia, but we don't have it.</p>
<p>We are connected to the rest of the country and I think we need to be alert to where we stand in terms of holidays. This single additional holiday will not even put us into the average for Canadian holidays let alone anywhere near the top. Alberta has 10 holidays; I believe there are 11 in Saskatchewan, paid statutory holidays, and in Saskatchewan, when they introduced their Family Day, which they call it, they had just as much outcry from CFIB as we will hear here in Nova Scotia. It is the mandate of CFIB and other business organizations to speak for their members and to point out the costs. We have to understand that and respect that. They are doing what they need to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it was once said to me that we should leave all the holidays to the business community. In fact, somebody from the chamber of commerce said, you know, government shouldn't do that. Well, for heaven's sakes, would we have any statutory holidays if we left it to the business community? Would we have children working in mines if we had left it to the business community? We are responsible for health and wellness. We are responsible for the labour standards of this province and that's what this relates to. We have to set a balance and we're very conscious of the impact on business.</p>
<p>I think what has been missed a little bit, although the member for Cape Breton - I'm not sure of his new riding - (Interruption) Cape Breton Centre, the member for Cape Breton Centre did point out there are benefits to this holiday. One reason why the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education has chosen to wait a full year to introduce it is so that business can capitalize on the benefits and that's very important.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the provinces that have this holiday, it has become a winter festival. They have tourism events. They have reasons to celebrate in their communities, and definitely, people are going out for food and beverage, to speak to the Food and Beverage Association. When people get together and they come to town to skate at the Oval, or to attend a play in whatever community, whatever place they're going to, they usually go out for hot chocolate with their children, or for dinner with their family. So there is going to be a benefit in what is actually the slowest month of the entire year for food and beverage sales. February is, bar none, the worst one.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, I know I'm going to get another opportunity to rise on this. I'm being urged to move this along so we can go to the Law Amendments Committee. The real reason is we want to hear from the people of Nova Scotia. My last comment, just to go to the business community because we are concerned about them, is that the CFIB themselves do frequent surveying of their members and several years ago they asked them about the February holiday and nearly 40 per cent of the respondents said they were in favour. So even in that strong business group, several years ago 40 per cent were in favour and I would bet you it's higher today.</p></speech>

In November we announced that Executive Council had approved the establishment of Treasury and Policy Board, Issues Committee, and Legislation Committee.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Executive Council Act and Public Service Act will create the new Treasury and Policy Board and update language in the Act to reflect this change and recent changes to department names and mandates. Specifically, these amendments will update the Executive Council Act and Public Service Act to be consistent with the change of name and mandates for the Departments of Education and Early Childhood Development and Finance, and Treasury Board, and the Office of Planning and Priorities; remove the chair of Treasury Board from the Executive Council Act as the Treasury Board Committee and Treasury Board Office no longer exists; and repeal provisions relating to Treasury Board, Policy and Priorities Committee, and Economic Investment Committee; and establish the Treasury and Policy Board and set out its objectives and mandate.</p>
<p>Other housekeeping amendments will update the Executive Council Act to correct the reference to the Lieutenant Governor and amend the provision relating to acting ministers, to allow for retroactive appointments to be consistent with the provision for acting ministers in the Public Service Act.

<p>I will begin today by congratulating you, Mr. Speaker, for the remarkable achievements in your life and for the honour that you have bestowed on this House in serving as Speaker. I share the view of our Premier that your balanced, conciliatory, and collegial nature will ensure our Assembly is governed with civility and respect. (Applause)</p>
<p>I also want to offer my congratulations to my MLA colleague, the member for Hants East on her appointment to Deputy Speaker. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we have serving as Speaker and Deputy Speaker two individuals who are an inspiration to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to be here today representing the citizens of Kings South. During the course of the election campaign I visited over 6,300 citizens in my riding, from the Annapolis Valley First Nation in Cambridge, in the west end, through Coldbrook, New Minas, Wolfville, the Gaspereau Mountain, White Rock, to Grande-Pr&#xE9;, Avonport, and the Glooscap First Nation near Hants border on the eastern end of the riding.</p>
<p>I have come to this Legislature equipped with their hopes and dreams for this province, their concerns and advice on improving government services, and their faith that collectively we will make decisions in the best interest of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in southwestern Nova Scotia, in a graveyard outside of Hebron, lies my great-great-grandfather, Whitman Butler. Not many details are known to me of Whitman Butler's life but however I do know that in 1865, at age 28, he achieved his Master Mariner papers. I know this because I have these papers with me today enclosed in a metal storage container that went with my great-great-grandfather on board the barque, the <i>Mary Killam</i>, built in Salmon River. He sailed this wooden sailing ship out of Yarmouth to South America 150 years ago.</p>
<p>He achieved his Master Mariner credentials when Sir Charles Tupper, one of our Fathers of Confederation, who was schooled at Horton Academy in my riding, was our Premier - the Premier who would lead Nova Scotia into Confederation. Knowing that my great-great-grandfather was involved in the early trade economy of this province while Sir Charles Tupper walked the halls of this building, Province House, contemplating decisions around Confederation, has given me a great sense of history and continuity to the task of province-building that lies ahead for us.</p>
<p>These mariner papers serve as my reminder that each generation has a responsibility to lead where we have not yet been, to make decisions that will improve upon the circumstances of today's citizens, and lay a sound foundation for the next generations. I want to assure the people of Kings South that each and every day I will diligently undertake this responsibility on their behalf.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, following my graduation from the School of Architecture at the Technical University of Nova Scotia in 1982, I embarked on a journey that would take me to Switzerland to work as an architect in training, to West Africa as a volunteer, and then to Canada's Arctic as a practising architect. My experience in volunteering with Canadian Crossroads International, at a small school in the bush of Cameroon for four months, changed my life. It opened my eyes to the importance and rewards of volunteerism and community service. Volunteer board work became a significant part of my life which then led me to serve my community through elected service at the municipal level. I've slayed a few dragons along the way in these roles which I hope will come in handy in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we heard in the Speech from the Throne last week some sobering facts about the performance of Nova Scotia's economy in the last decade and the resulting out-migration of our citizens. Sadly, the Annapolis Valley has not been exempt from these trends. At hundreds of doors during the election campaign I heard from people who want this government to make decisions that will provide opportunities for their children and grandchildren to stay in this province, and even perhaps their great-great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to the election, I took the opportunity to attend a presentation by Ray Ivany on the interim report of the Nova Scotia Commission on Building Our New Economy. In my opinion, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ivany and the commission are undertaking one of the most important assignments of our generation: developing a road map for Nova Scotia's next economy.</p>
<p>We are fortunate that early in the life of our new government we will receive the commission's report and decide where and how to act on its recommendations. The work of the commission to date has a core message, which is this: we must be ready to do things differently. If we approach the development of our economy as we have in the past, we should not be surprised that we get the same result. The commission will be presenting a challenge to the people of Nova Scotia on what it will take to build a new economy, and I will be accepting that challenge on behalf of the citizens of Kings South.</p>
<p>I'm already seeing encouraging investments and innovation in small and medium-size businesses in Kings South. Two weeks ago I attended the grand opening of the Centre for Innovation and Incubation Services at Acadia University, which is helping small entrepreneurs with innovation and their information technology needs. This is the type of collaboration we must promote to build the next economy, and by that I mean harnessing the research capacity within our universities with the knowledge potential of our students to foster innovation in small- and medium-size businesses in our communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I also attended an event at Alderney Landing last month with my colleague, the member for Preston-Dartmouth, the Minister of Agriculture, for the celebration of the 19 agri-businesses invested in by FarmWorks Investment Co-operative. Linda Best, one of the founding members of FarmWorks and a constituent of mine, has said to me numerous times that if we could just harness a small percentage of the millions of dollars Nova Scotians invest outside this province and put that money into our own food production and distribution businesses in this province, we could create rural jobs and increase access to rural food supply. FarmWorks enables these types of investments.</p>
<p>In the last few years we've witnessed a remarkable shift in agriculture in Kings South toward higher-value crops like high-bush blueberries, high-value apples, and grapes, and this is transforming our agricultural land and our economy. It was encouraging to read in last week's paper that farming in Nova Scotia is becoming a more lucrative business. Statistics Canada released data that showed that the net income of Nova Scotia farmers doubled to $52 million in 2012, up from $26 million a year previous. While some caution that this growth is from a particularly bad year, we are the only province to show an increase in the number of farms between 2006 and 2012.</p>
<p>We know that our farmers face tight margins, but I have to say that the growth reported by Statistics Canada in Nova Scotia agri-business is something that I am seeing every day in Kings South - in our farmers' markets, in the number of restaurants now promoting locally-sourced food, in our festivals such as the Devour Food and Film Festival that just concluded, and in the visitors who are packing our winery bus every summer and Fall.</p>
<p>I believe there's considerable potential in building our next economy around the innovation in agriculture, cultural and tourism industries, particularly in rural areas of Nova Scotia like my own riding of Kings South. Embracing this vision means advancing the discussion on protecting our farmlands, and this does not have to involve new study.</p>
<p>In 2010 the Nova Scotia Land Review Committee, chaired by Rick Williams, released their report on how to preserve our farmlands. The Williams report was informed by consultations with farmers, developers and recreational land users. I believe that our shift in focus to small and medium-size businesses in Nova Scotia must reflect long-term thinking around protecting Nova Scotia's land capable of producing food and encouraging the growth of compact, sustainable communities instead of rural sprawl that is costing our municipalities much more than can be afforded.</p>
<p>I commend the work of the No Farms No Food organization in my riding that has been instrumental in ensuring our province has a farmland trust. I have tackled the issue of land use from two angles: as an architect, and through chairing two municipal planning advisory committees. Conflicts in land use for the siting of landfills, new development, agricultural uses, recreational uses, gravel pits, and wind farms - these conflicts abound in this province.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see in the province's Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act that land use is not mentioned. Perhaps it is time for Nova Scotia to reflect on the link between land use and sustainability, and consider a land-use framework for the province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to turn to a subject close to my heart, and that is the future of towns in Nova Scotia. I've had the privilege of serving on two municipal councils in two jurisdictions: Iqaluit, Canada's newest capital city, just after the creation of the territory in 1999; and here in this province, in Wolfville, the fastest-growing community in Nova Scotia. I know that a number of my colleagues here have arrived at Province House with valuable experience in municipal politics behind them. It is my hope that in the 62<sup>nd</sup> General Assembly we can make the most of this collective municipal experience by working collaboratively with the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities on actions that will improve the fiscal sustainability of our communities, and in particular our rural communities.</p>
<p>We began to tackle the issue of fiscal health in Wolfville by creating a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force, which I had the pleasure of chairing. We examined the long-term trends of tax revenue, including the tax inequities created by the property assessment cap, and we looked at the declining state of our infrastructure, particularly our roads. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has effectively laid out the extent of the infrastructure deficit in Canada. It is a national issue played out in the crumbling roads and sidewalks of our Nova Scotia towns and cities.</p>
<p>As provincial legislators, we can use our voice to advocate for a robust and sustained federal infrastructure program. We can also play a key role in supporting and encouraging community-driven initiatives to examine more cost-effective municipal governance structures. It is clear to me Nova Scotians know it is time to seriously examine municipal governance and regional co-operation.</p>
<p>I know more regional co-operation between municipalities can be part of the solution because I saw it first-hand as chairperson of the Valley Waste Resource Management Board. Valley Waste manages solid waste on behalf of eight municipalities in the Annapolis Valley; it's a cost-effective and efficient model for regional service delivery.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I meet with business owners in Coldbrook and New Minas and throughout the riding, I hear a common complaint about governments thwarting their growth and success because of a burden of regulatory requirements and fees. They view the many rules, costly applications, and filings from different levels of government as time consuming and an expensive barrier to their business's success. As our government shifts focus to small and medium-size businesses, I believe we must include in this strategy a fresh look at what can be done to streamline the regulatory requirements for small business.</p>
<p>It's not just the business community that feels the burden of administrative processes. In my riding two exceptional citizens, Kathy Menko and Janet Roberts, are quietly assisting individuals and families who use the Wolfville Food Bank in accessing low-income programs that require social assistance numbers and birth certificates - documentation that most people simply don't have. These two remarkable volunteers not only make low-income families aware of programs they are entitled to but assist them in making applications for services and support for which they are entitled. I refer to this as the "food bank plus program" and this is an idea worth replicating throughout this province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after meeting with thousands of families in Kings South in the weeks leading up to October 8<sup>th</sup>, I can assure you that investing in improvements in quality education is at the top of the list of many parents' priorities for this government. I am sure all my colleagues can share stories from families of children with special needs who are simply not getting the services needed, including mental health services.</p>
<p>Inadequate special needs programming impacts directly on students who need additional supports, on their parents, on the student's classmates, and on teachers. Our commitment to reinvesting in education must include front-line investments in special education services.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in my role as a parent, along with my years as a town councillor in Wolfville, I have sharpened my thinking about the role that schools serve in our communities. Our strategy for rural economies, or rural health delivery, or rural roads is inextricably bound to our strategy for investing in schools. We must do everything within the means of this government to be forward thinking about our investment in schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it would be remiss of me not to offer my utmost support for the work going on in our government right now on evaluating and updating our Continuing Care Strategy for seniors. I had many conversations with seniors during the campaign, and 99 per cent of the time they were more than gracious in offering their opinion about how our government can improve services for seniors. We have many seniors living on their own, without family support, so I heard reasoned and modest suggestions for services that could improve their ability to access existing health services.</p>
<p>The review of our Continuing Care Strategy is an indication to our seniors that we will not forget them. Our government's plan to streamline health administration so Nova Scotians can access treatment faster will directly impact the many seniors I have talked to in Kings South who are on lengthy waiting lists for treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, each and every day that I walk into this historic building of Province House I am reminded that I am here because of the remarkable people who have played a role in my life, beginning with my parents who introduced me at a young age to what it meant to be part of community building - in their instance, through the arts world.</p>
<p>My father Ron Irving's career was dedicated to his community of Prince Edward Island, telling the important stories of rural life and rural values. He is a man of great integrity and honesty and he has been recognized with the Order of Canada, for which I am very proud. My mother, Daphne Irving is also dedicated to her community through her church work and her art. She has been honoured by the Royal Canadian Academy and her paintings hang in many corners of this country. (Applause)</p>
<p>The support my parents provided to myself and my sisters, Martha Irving and Anne Mack, have allowed us all to achieve so much. I also must credit my dad for the single most important sports decision of my life - introducing me, as a young boy, to Fenway Park and the Boston Red Sox. There were actually two wonderful Red victories for me this October.</p>
<p>I also want to publicly acknowledge and thank my wife Katherine Trumper, whom I met while living in Canada's Arctic. Katherine is a brilliant and talented woman who has supported me through five campaigns, and in the most recent election took on the role of my campaign manager. Her talents in managing and motivating people helped build a tremendous team of volunteers. She has sacrificed so much to allow me to pursue a career in public service, and I thank her from the bottom of my heart. My son, Simon, who was born in Nunavut and is now attending his second year at Dalhousie University, has given up his time with Dad on many a night so that I can pursue my passion for public service, and I want to thank Simon for his support.</p>
<p>I must complete the family thank yous by acknowledging our family dog, Fenway. Our Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, the official dog of Nova Scotia, campaigned beside me in several parades, and I am absolutely certain that she secured a few votes for me.</p>
<p>I want to conclude my remarks today by paying tribute and offering my sincerest thanks to my remarkable campaign team of over 60 citizens in Kings South, and I would like to table a document with the list. In particular, I would like to recognize the dedication of my official agent John Mroz, and a core team that included Pat and Vera Burke, Christine Pynch, David Daniels, Eric Smith, Kim Monette, Evan Fairn, Gerri Robertson, Frances Jacobsen, Jodi DeLong, Bob Trenholm, Bob Prange, Burnell Lyons, and Ellwood Dillman, and also the incoming generation of supporters, students from Acadia and NSCC, Conor McNeil, Jake Schofield, Christianne Robichaud, Rachel Lutz, Christopher Ioannou, Laura Dunn, and David Houston Goudge. There are many others, and I am so very grateful for their individual and collective contribution.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge the help and mentoring of my colleague from Kings County the honourable member for Kings West for his unwavering help and guidance these past few months. One other veteran of Nova Scotia politics who has been immensely helpful to me, including canvassing with me on numerous occasions, is the Member of Parliament for Kings-Hants, Scott Brison. Mr. Brison showed me how to sprint from door to door during the campaign. I'm indebted to both these fine people for tutoring me in the many roles of a politician.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the coming weeks, through a series of resolutions, I will be acknowledging the contributions of many remarkable citizens of Kings South, past and present, who have made extraordinary contributions to the vibrancy of the communities throughout the riding. Every day I am inspired by the initiative shown by citizens in community building, like the individuals leading the effort to rebuild the Black River Community Hall that burned down two years ago. The resolve of deeply-committed citizens to do what is necessary to strengthen their communities provides me with guidance and motivation where I can play a role in strengthening the community-building process.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to assure the citizens of Kings South that on each and every day of the life of this government I will represent their individual and collective concerns to our government. I have seen from my colleague the honourable Minister of Health and Wellness, the MLA for Kings West, and my MP Scott Brison, what is meant by being a good constituency MLA or MP, and I will apply these lessons to my work with the citizens in Kings South.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, earlier in my remarks I commented on the extraordinary sense of history I feel entering this House. Some of that sense of history is influenced by the small but important glimpse into my own family history that I carry with me today in the form of my great-great-grandfather's mariner papers. Each and every day our early citizens took enormous risks and overcame challenges that we now see as incremental steps in the process of province-building.</p>
<p>It is our time now and I look forward to working with all MLAs in the complex and demanding issues that lie ahead for this Assembly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#0f46e5e4-b06b-4b91-9e3a-5bd1cd63809d"><from>MR. LARRY HARRISON</from><p>First of all, Mr. Speaker, it is a true honour for me to rise in this House of Assembly as a representative of Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley. A little over a year ago I decided to retire after 41 years of ministry in the United Church of Canada. In that retirement plan I was going to pick up my curling again, pick up my golf again, go south for a bit and spend time with my grandkids.</p>
<p>Well, one day there was a knock on my door and a few folks walked in. They wanted to talk to me. When they asked if I would run for the Progressive Conservative Party, my mouth fell open. The thought never, ever crossed my mind that I would be here. My brother Bev has been in the PC Government in New Brunswick for many, many years - 23 in fact, as an MLA and as Speaker for two terms. I told that group of people that I would just think it over for a bit and I would get back to them.</p>
<p>Eventually my family and I decided that stepping away from serving a congregation in Nova Scotia such as Brookfield and Middle Stewiacke, and being a representative in this House, was not a big stretch. They have placed their trust in me and I'm going to work hard to honour that trust.</p>
<p>I know it's not going to be an easy road and I found that out very quickly because when I announced to my congregation that I was going to run for the PC Party in this election, some cheered, some clapped, some looked at me as if I was going on the road to sing, and you know I cannot sing, and some just sat there and didn't do a thing. I knew I wouldn't get their vote, so I knew upfront that it was going to be a tough time. From that day on, it indeed was a whirlwind.</p>
<p>Our campaign team came together very, very quickly. It was made up of people I have known for a good many years, such as Andy and Vera Fay, Geoff and Linda and Tammy - in fact I baptized all three of Tammy's children, and then, of course, my wife Susanne, my daughter Stacey, my son Brent, who did a lot of work on the campaign as well.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people that I just met: Randy, Morris, Patsy, Lloyd, Steve, Roseanne; Penny was the official agent and she kept a very tight rein on what was going to happen. There were so many people who worked on the campaign and donated money to my campaign because they believed in the democratic process and wanted to see things move. They believed in me and because they did, it was almost an overwhelming feeling.</p>
<p>Politics is a new world for me. All of the energy and experience that the volunteers brought to the campaign was certainly invaluable. When anyone asked me how things were going in my campaign, I always said that I had met a lot of very nice people, very committed people, and I truly appreciate every bit of work that was done on my behalf. I wish I could thank every single person who worked on the campaign and donated money but there are a lot of people and I signed thank you notes to the point I thought it would never end, but it's done; I feel good about it and I think they feel good.</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who volunteered to work for Gary Burrill and Tom Martin as well. They did a fantastic job, it was a clean campaign and I enjoyed my time with them. The returning officer was also from my area, Sharon O'Leary, and she handled the returning office and did a fantastic job in making the election go fairly smoothly in our area.</p>
<p>Of course, I have to give a thank you to someone who has turned out to be a friend and also my Member of Parliament and that is Scott Armstrong. Scott was invaluable in helping me through the campaign process and was with me on many occasions. I'm especially excited to work with Scott and we're going to strive to make things better in this province. We both have the feeling that people have to come first and I am certainly looking forward to working with him and working with the municipality because one thing we have found out is that when the three levels of government work together, good things will happen - municipal, provincial as well as federal.</p>
<p>During my campaign I started to hear how people really feel about politicians. (Interruption) I'm not sure I'm going to tell you everything but it was my close friends and congregants who were really honest with me. In the last 35 years they had known me to be honest, that they could come to me at any time, to be compassionate when they did come, and they had a question mark in their minds: is being a politician going to change who I am? For some reason many people think that this House of Assembly is just the opposite of being honest, caring and compassionate. So many don't see that we are here to serve because they believe they have little say in what we do and how it affects them.</p>
<p>They only hear the side of politics that the media like to portray - the few who are in it for themselves rather than to serve the people, but there are only a few. I think of the many good politicians who served our area for many years: Bob Stanfield, Ike Smith, Colin Stewart, Ken Streatch, Brooke Taylor, Gary Burrill. These are all MLAs who served the people of Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley with honour - and I plan to follow in their footsteps. (Applause)</p>
<p>Near the end of my campaign I was - and when those kids walked in I was thinking</p>
<p>about them and how they see things - this story was told to me from a resident, and some of the folks know it here. A grandmother came up to me one day and said that she picked up her 12-year-old grandson from school - they were discussing politics that day, going over what was happening in the election and so on. The grandmother said that she picked the child up, they got in the car. Dead silence. Eventually the little fellow said, Gram, is Mr. Harrison a minister, and she said yes. Is he going to be a politician? She said yes. Dead silence. Isn't that a sin? (Laughter)</p></speech>

<p>These are very serious times and it's going to require very serious leadership. This is not a time in the history of the province to play the games, and I'm really not here to do that. At one time people would joke about what politicians did and how they reacted to each other, but you know today people just don't laugh anymore, it's a different environment. They are asking for a very common-sense approach to the needs of the province.</p>
<p>Over the last year more than 4,000 people left Nova Scotia to go to work elsewhere. Whole families have just picked up and moved because there's really nothing for them here. Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians really don't care who brings the common-sense changes - let's be honest, about 95 per cent of Nova Scotians, when it comes to political Parties it doesn't mean a thing. There are some but not very many. They see us as all the same, the yellow, the red, the blue. We need to be able to show them that they're right, that underneath the blue, underneath the yellow, underneath the red, the orange, that we are all the same because every one of us in this House wants people to get back to work, we want to have better health care, we want to know that our children are going to have good education - and we all want every single one of the roads paved. (Applause)</p>
<p>Anyway I think we all just want better lives for our constituents; that's why we're here. And I think that's why our constituents put us here - to do that.</p>
<p>They want a government that is going to listen to their concerns, and to them the government is just a big faceless monster, but it isn't, is it? It's just you and me. We are the people who can meet with our constituents, we can listen to their concerns and, hopefully, be able to solve a lot of their issues. We want people to be happy, we want farmers to produce, we want businesses to prosper, but we aren't experts so we're going to need to go to these people and find out exactly what they do need to be happy, be productive, and also to be prosperous - and maybe that just means getting out of their way sometimes.</p>
<p>One of the things that has always bothered me when I talk to people is the regulations when they go to do something - they are taxed, and permitted, and regulated to death.</p>
<p>We all know that a vast majority of our constituents are good people who are honest and hard-working, but for the sake of those few out there who are not co-operative, we throw up roadblocks for everybody. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just cut through all of the red tape and regulations that are holding back those who are careful and able to use their own common sense? We know the rules are in place for a reason, but if someone falls just outside that little circle that we have put there, put in place by governments, they are held off as though they are the ones who are abusing the system. We all know many good and honest people who are hurt because they play by the rules while they watch others find a way to get around the rules.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the red tape and the regulations don't only hurt good, hard-working folks. They also impact on businesses and in our communities. Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley is dotted with many small, medium-size, and large businesses. Bill and Lois Spinney are running the Greenfield Golf Course. That became an 18-hole course from a nine-hole course in 1991. I'm very proud to announce that Brookfield has had an 18-hole course for many, many years. In Clifton, the Blois family's Moulding Knives are sold all over the world, and they can be made in 48 hours. Marwood Limited in Brookfield has been a part of our constituency for 90 years, and the Creelman family started their business in Upper Stewiacke. They have plants and offices all across Atlantic Canada, and they have been one fantastic support to me over the years.</p>
<p>The pellet mill in Middle Musquodoboit - my son worked there for many years. It has now been taken over by a Vancouver company. The Streatch family of Elderbank produce 800 acres of nursery sod a year, and they have Granview Farms and Musquodoboit Valley Quality Sod. Brookfield has a sod company as well. More than $480 million come from the airport, come from businesses around the airport, such as Pratt &amp; Whitney and Northrup Grumman Canada. The economic diversity in this constituency is fantastic.</p>
<p>Businesses are more than just bricks and mortar. They are the taxes that keep our province running. They are the jobs that keep our residents working, and they are the stability that keep our communities very strong. We have more than a dozen volunteer fire departments in our constituency that work very hard to keep us safe. These volunteer firefighters rely on us to keep our province prosperous so that they are employed close to home and have the time and ability to rush to the scene of an accident when needed.</p>
<p>Now, whether it's economic development or education or health care, we need to ensure that we will do our best for the people of Nova Scotia. In Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley we have two main hospitals, the Memorial Hospital in Musquodoboit and the Colchester Regional Hospital. Both facilities have exceptional front-line workers who put patients first. I volunteered for years with the palliative care team in the Colchester Regional Hospital, and I got to see first-hand what is done. I understand the Minister of Health and Wellness - and I know he is - will be visiting these hospitals. I'm going to say right now that if I can be of any help in going with him to these hospitals, I would be more than willing to do so because we really do need to work together to strengthen the services that we provide.</p>
<p>I have had a goal through this, by the way, and I have shared that goal with my family, with my friends. My vision is to have the welfare of the province come first. People are really ready to put party politics behind them; they are ready. We need to set the tone here, amongst us in this room. It will carry over into every single area that we are able to influence.</p>
<p>I heard the honourable Premier allude to this, as did the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and this is my goal as well. I can assure you that this Assembly will work hard to meet the needs of Nova Scotians. Do you know what? I want to work really hard with them. I will stand up for the people of my constituency. I will let them know about the issues that are affecting them, roads that need to be paved, culverts that need to be replaced - I'm sorry about this, to the minister, but we're going to have a chat later.</p>
<p>For some reason it has been a practice just to do patchwork and there is a lot of patchwork in our area that needs to be redone because of even flooding. Flooding has been a major problem in our area for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that changes need to be made in the province. That is why each and every one of us agreed to put our names on the ballot back in October. We want to make Nova Scotia better for this generation and for the generations to come, that's our goal. Folks, whether it's Liberal, NDP, Progressive Conservative, I want to work with you for the betterment of this province. That is my dream, that is my goal. I want to work with my constituents to help make Nova Scotia better for them.</p>
<p>Just as an aside, I want to close with this. Our constituency office is now open. It is at Mastodon Ridge on your way through to Truro. When I'm sitting in the Legislature or at a meeting, I know that my constituency assistant Paula Henderson is very, very hard at work. She has carried things for the last number of weeks and I want to thank her for that. She shares my goal, she shares our goal - a strong, prosperous, vibrant Nova Scotia where everyone can live to their greatest potential.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for listening folks. It's a pleasure to be here and I look forward to working with you over the next four years. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>Whereas the Liberals have been given many chances to do the right thing with respect to their trust funds, invoking a telling silence from the honourable member for Clayton Park when she was called upon to offer a defence of her Leader; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Liberals, under their current Leader, made a decision not to do the right thing and clung to their trust funds until they were about to be pried from their hands; and</p>
<p>Whereas serious questions remain about what happened to the funds and about how the Liberals continued to enjoy financial advantage from the legacy of the funds;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of the House of Assembly demand that the Liberal Leader disclose the identity of all officers, directors, and/or trustees of whatever entity the funds were given to, and the nature of all past and present relationships between those people and the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>The honourable member for Bedford-Birch Cove.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm very pleased today to have the opportunity to talk about my riding a little bit as we go into Supply. As many of the members of this House may know, the Bedford area, the Birch Cove area, they were actually settled quite early - long before European settlers arrived, in fact - by the Mi'kmaq, and these were fishing areas, summer encampments for the Mi'kmaq. Once European settlers arrived, we saw a variety of summer homes built along that way, and of course, what is now in my riding, and will soon be part of the riding of Clayton Park West, for example, would be the home of Julie de St. Laurent, who was the paramour of the future father of Queen Victoria, and she lived out there, it was a lovely home, sort of away from the hustle and bustle of Halifax. So, over time, these communities became what we call bedroom communities, and eventually, Bedford, in fact, became a town of its own.</p>
<p>One of the things, though, that was sort of a hallmark, unfortunately of Bedford and of Birch Cove for a long time was a lack of facilities. There was a lack of investment in facilities from various levels of government, and I must say that there has been almost nothing in the way of new investment under the federal Tories in my riding over the last number of years. There are a number of private facilities. We now just recently have the Daniel Nestor tennis facility that opened up in the Rocky Lake area. We have Maskwa, which is a lovely facility on Kearney Lake, and many of you may be familiar with Maskwa because it's the home facility of Mark de Jonge, who is Canada's bronze medal-winning Olympian. And we have - we call it The Bubble; it's a rink surface, it was named after a former councillor - and somehow it got $1 million dollars from the federal government, but our four-pad, that serves all of metro, which is now called the BMO Centre, that BMO Centre got nothing from the federal government. It was quite shameful. It didn't get a dime.</p>
<p>Somehow, the federal government thought they should invest a million dollars in a private rink, and we're happy to have that rink, and we're pleased it's here, we're happy they invested a million dollars. But somehow, they didn't think it worthy to invest anything in a four-pad that was being built for all of HRM. It was funny, because the rest of Canada, at the time, was awash in cash for recreation projects. For every community centre, fake lake, gazebo, there was money but somehow, for the BMO Centre, there was nothing.</p>
<p>That decision let this NDP government off the hook and they only put in $2 million when they should have probably put in $10 million or $11 million. But we are thankful that they did put in $2 million, because that way, HRM taxpayers did not bear the total cost of the rink, which is what it would have been. There was no federal contribution, and a small provincial contribution.</p>
<p>So our community is made up of people from many different countries. Some were born here, others were not. Some of us may speak many different languages, we may eat different foods and have different customs, but we all share a desire to work hard, to see our children grow, succeed, and prosper.</p>
<p>Earlier today we had a prominent member of the Bedford community in here with us, Taleb Abidali, and together with his partner, Hossein Mousavi, they have turned Cresco into a going concern. It's a really neat story because you have these two men, one comes from Iran the other comes from Iraq, and they have joined together to create a highly successful company - in fact now they're related because Hossein's nephew married Taleb's daughter. So it's a lovely story.</p>
<p>One of the things I'm hearing a lot lately is how the federal Conservatives are cutting back money, cutting back money, cutting back money. The latest thing I heard this past week, I had a woman in my office who teaches English as a Second Language and she told me that they are in fact cutting back on the hours of language training for immigrants. To me that doesn't make any sense, it certainly doesn't coming from a riding like Bedford which, like Halifax Clayton Park, has a lot of immigrants and a lot of immigrants who want to work, who are here to work and to suddenly find out that they are being hampered because a lack of federal investment is quite disappointing - but I'll have more to say on that later.</p>
<p>One of the new facilities that we are getting now, which I must give credit to the former Progressive Conservative Government here, provincial government, they did announce in 2009 that they were going to build a new high school. I did note that that was, I believe, in the Speech from the Throne - at least it did say there was a new school coming for Bedford and I'm assuming it's the same school and not another new one. But if I'm wrong I'd be happy to be wrong; if the Education Minister wants to correct me on that I'd be happy with that.</p>
<p>Much of what happens in Bedford happens because residents pay up. As I indicated earlier a lot of the facilities we have there are private; they are not public facilities. When that new school was announced one of the things we wanted to do was to create a performing arts centre and we came together with people from Sackville and they indicated that they wanted a performance centre because there was nothing there, but what we were told was that there would be no performing arts centre built, or theatres built, in conjunction with schools unless we had buy-in from the local municipality - so that sort of killed that dream.</p>
<p>Now we are going to have a cafetorium and we will be able to have some performances there. I would like to thank the school advisory council from Charles P. Allen High School, Elaine Looney and her team, they worked really, really, really hard to get some changes made to that design, to make it more what the community was looking for, but I have to tell you we had to fight every step of the way to get our concerns heard. We had to fight to get the design team just to talk to the band teacher - you would think that when you're going to put in an audio system in a facility where there are going to be performances by a band, you would think that maybe somebody would think it was a good idea to talk to the band teacher because he has done hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of performances with many different organizations, various bands, et cetera. But nobody wanted to talk to him.</p>
<p>In the end we did get what we needed, but it took a lot - and at the same time we were treated to this other, it was actually the most bizarre thing I have ever seen, which was I went for a tour of the facility, and I had been warned this was going on and I had written a letter, et cetera, but we have this beautiful AstroTurf field, fence around it, lights, it's gorgeous, and at the end of that field sits half a shed - and I went for the tour and I said I can't believe this is happening. So HRM built their half of the shed, and HRSB, or the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, was supposed to build the other half of the shed - only they decided they weren't going to build that. So there was a concrete slab put in, and when I went to visit the site there was half a shed - so I took some pictures.</p>
<p>The irony of all of this is that we were told we could not fundraise to build a theatre in the school. We were not allowed to fundraise to build capital projects, unless the municipality was involved. But then the school community started getting phone calls to fundraise to build half a shed.</p>
<p>Now as you can imagine, they were a little perturbed because they didn't really want to fundraise to build half a shed, they wanted to fundraise for a theatre. So eventually, after letters and photos, et cetera, the Department of Education and/or HRSB decided to build the other half of the shed and they agreed to do it. I would like to thank the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, if it was her influence, after I alerted her to this particular instance, if that's what made that half a shed happen, I did appreciate it. I want to thank the minister for the common sense. Of course, it would have been cheaper to just build the whole thing at once, the first time it went up, instead of having to build the other half later.</p>
<p>The result is we're going to have a terrific facility that opens this Fall but I do want to point out that once again it is Bedford residents and Kingswood residents, in this case, who have paid an area rate to upgrade the facilities in that area. We've got extra stuff going into that school, not quite what we wanted, but extra stuff going in, because they're paying an area rate.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to do in Bedford. One of the things that I've noticed, when I was nominated in 2009, we were very concerned that we were not going to have a place to have a campaign headquarters on the Bedford Highway because business was booming, you could not find space on the Bedford Highway. We managed to get some but it was a close thing. I will tell you that right now there are all kinds of empty spaces along the Bedford Highway. That's what the business climate is like. Every time I see another sign go up saying, closing out, moving out, I stop in and talk to the owners.</p>
<p>It's not a good business environment right now and it hasn't been for some time. That's the difference between 2009 and 2013. It is four years and it has not been four years of steady improvement. In fact, what we've seen is a business climate where I go into store after store and they are shutting down. The business just simply isn't there anymore. We have to ask, where has it gone and why has it gone?</p>
<p>I expect that on other days I will get to speak a little more. I know I am down to only about two minutes now. I do want to talk about the Bedford waterfront. That project got underway in 1985 when the Bedford Waterfront Development Corporation put together a plan and it would infill parts of the harbour in Bedford and it got underway.</p>
<p>Initially silt was used from the Sackville River and the park that we have today, DeWolf Park, came out of that. There are some lovely houses along there, a variety of town homes, apartment buildings, some low rises, some high rises. Also we have our fire station, police station on that, as well as a very nice seniors' residence.</p>
<p>Now Bedford is faced with - where do we go from here? We have a distinct lack of public buildings in Bedford. I hope that in the coming days and weeks I will have the opportunity to speak further about what is ahead for Bedford. Thank you.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#9b3bfcb7-daab-41b1-a100-fcb627238356"><from>MR. JOACHIM STROINK</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first let me start by saying wow, what an honour it is to be standing in the House as an elected official for the riding of Halifax Chebucto. What a great privilege it is to have the opportunity to say a few words in response to the Speech from the Throne.</p>
<p>I would first like to acknowledge everyone who is in this Chamber. As someone who does not come from a political background, I have great respect and admiration for hard work that we all have signed up for to represent the people in our constituencies. Your dedication to this province is inspiring.</p>
<p>I would like to start my speech by taking a moment to acknowledge two people who dedicated their lives to the riding of Halifax Chebucto. First, Alexa McDonough, who became the first woman to lead a major recognized political Party in Canada, when she was elected the Nova Scotia New Democrat Party Leader in 1980. She served as a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1981 to 1994, representing Halifax Chebucto and Halifax Fairview electoral districts. She stepped down as the Nova Scotia NDP's Leader and as a member of the Legislature in 1994. She subsequently ran for, and was elected, as Leader of the federal New Democrat Party in 1995. McDonough was elected as a Member of Parliament for the federal electoral district of Halifax in 1997. She stepped down as the Party Leader in 2003. I remember her growing up, and admire her dedication and powerful representation of a Nova Scotia legislator on the national stage.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to acknowledge Howard Epstein. First elected to Halifax City Council in 1994, he was re-elected in 1996 with the formation of the Halifax Regional Municipality. Epstein sat as a councillor for District 14, Connaught and Quinpool, representing the city's West End. On March 24<sup>th</sup>, 1998 Epstein was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for the New Democrat Party, representing the provincial riding of Halifax Chebucto. He was elected in 1999 and served until the 2013 general election.</p>
<p>So, I have big shoes to fill, representing Halifax Chebucto in this Chamber. Am I ready? You bet I am. I grew up in this riding. I'm a first generation Canadian who comes from a hardworking Dutch family. My father retired from Dalhousie University as the Dean of Physics and Biomedical Engineering and my mother retired from the IWK as a Child Life Specialist on the oncology unit. The two of them raised me with strong values of the importance of community and family and I now live in the Halifax Chebucto riding with my wife and two young daughters.</p>
<p>In order for me to be standing here, it took a tremendously talented team who believed that together we could govern differently. I would like to thank my campaign managers, Shawn Cleary and Michelle Daignault. Shawn knocked on doors for me for over nine months before the election was called and with his help, we were able to knock on every door before the election was called and we listened to so many people. Michelle Daignault worked behind the scenes for many months prior to the election and also knocked on many doors.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Dr. John Gillis who put this idea of running into my head. I would like to thank Martin MacKinnon; Colin Pearcey; Daniel Bourque; Liam Daly, who's in the east gallery here; Patricia Donnelly; Mary Hope; Anna Laroue; PJ Cowan; Jane O'Neil; Leo Artalejo; and finally, Joan Fraser - by the way, Joan told me on election night that she could now die peacefully knowing that there was finally a Liberal in the riding of Halifax Chebucto. Most of all, I would like to thank all the volunteers who helped me within this riding. This was 100 per cent a team effort, so thank you.</p>
<p>There are also three people who deserve a big thank you. First, my amazing and patient wife and my soul mate, April. We have known each other for over 20 years and have been married for 13. April has been the biggest driving force to keeping work and family balanced. You see, she happens to be married to someone who is both ADD and dyslexic and so clearly she's a very patient and committed woman. The next two I have to thank are my daughters, Onica who is nine and Sophia who is six. These two knocked on doors with me and pounding signs into the lawns, and most of all gave me a hug when I needed it. So thank you to my lovely daughters.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I need to share a small piece of history about the Halifax Chebucto riding. In 1931 Blue Bell Farms, between Chebucto Road and Bayers Road, was the location of the first airfield in Halifax. Today this airfield is marked by Saunders Park and then in the 1950s the airfields were turned into the Victory Houses and many of the streets are named after famous war heroes. One of these war heroes is the grandson of Abraham and Annie Arab, the first Lebanese immigrants to come to Nova Scotia. He would be the second cousin of the MLA for Fairview-Clayton Park. Lieutenant Edward Francis Arab, who died on October 25, 1944, in the Netherlands, was helping to free my parents' homeland, so I am grateful to the Arab family and to many other Canadians who gave up their lives to free my parents' homeland and my second home, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, now I need to address what really brought me to this Chamber: my love of Nova Scotia. This place has 7,400 kilometres of coastline, and where you can still go into the back country, like the places like the Tobeatic Wilderness reserve, and not see anybody for days. We are very lucky to have such a magical place for the outdoors.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia is struggling in many ways, and we really need to ask ourselves, especially in this great Chamber, what will it take to make Nova Scotia thrive? In every one of our ridings, we have amazing people who have a great love for this province, and all they want to do is make this place better to live in, so the first thing we need to do is listen to these great people as they have great ideas that will make Nova Scotia thrive. If that past government had taken the time to listen to me and my colleagues, then maybe I would not be here today and they might still be in power. But that was the past, so let's look to the future. Let's listen to the people around us. No matter how crazy their idea is, their idea may be the one that will make Nova Scotia thrive.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not also address small businesses in Nova Scotia. As you know, I own and operate several small businesses in Nova Scotia. At one time my wife and I had over 40 employees, but today we have 25. Small businesses are struggling right now in Nova Scotia. Retail is probably one of the hardest businesses to be in, because of the cost of doing business in Nova Scotia, which is one of the highest in North America. Power rates are going up. Nova Scotia has made it easier and cheaper for big box stores to do business in our province.</p>
<p>Standing here, I do not have the answers to fix these problems - but no, I have the capacity to listen to my colleagues and bring solutions to the forefront, where we can all debate these ideas in these Chambers. Within the next four years I will work tirelessly to make Nova Scotia a great place to own and operate small businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, with that in mind I would like to throw out a challenge: in December 2011 a proclamation was read in the House by the Honourable Percy Paris, where all Parties agreed to the concept of 10% Shift. So I ask that when you are out shopping for gifts for your family and friends this year, see if you can buy 10 per cent more of your gifts from local businesses. By leading this and making this kind of an effort, it shows Nova Scotians that we actually care that our money stays in Nova Scotia. If more money stays in Nova Scotia, then we'll be able to have the health care, the roads, and the education for our children that we all want. We will have a more robust economy that will enable us to fix roads in Lunenburg County and keep ERs open or build new schools in Spryfield. This, of course, will help people stay in Nova Scotia, and we need to lead by example. I hope that all my fellow MLAs will take on this challenge, especially today.</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge all the women in the House. As the father of two young daughters, it is great for them to see all these women as great leaders in our community. We have women as leaders of a Party, women as ministers, and women as MLAs. These women will set the tone for many young girls in this province, including my daughters, so I thank you for your service in showing young women that you can be and do anything.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I ask that all political Parties treat each other as humans, with respect - that we do not turn our back on the Leaders of the Parties while they speak, that we conduct ourselves in a manner that Nova Scotians can be proud of, that our youth can look up to us and say, wow, even though they have different views and opinions, they treat each other with the utmost respect. I want to come and work in a place where everyone is respected and valued, and I look forward to working with all of you to make Nova Scotia a place where people and communities and businesses will thrive. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand and speak for a few moments, as we go into Supply, on this budget that we all learned about, of course, on Thursday and have had the opportunity, over the weekend, to have a quick look at it and I am looking forward to the estimates process. I say, looking forward to, a bit tongue-in-cheek because it is a long, drawn-out process but we do have the opportunity to look at the budget line by line and to ask questions of the respective ministers on their budgets.</p>
<p>I can say I've had the opportunity to sit on both sides of the House when it comes to budget estimates, and I can tell you it is much more relaxing being in Opposition when it comes to this. I know on many occasions many of the ministers have to sit for hours on end and I look forward to them answering those questions as concisely as they possibly can. I thank them for their answers in the last couple of years, some of them are quite good, some of them are a little vague, but I guess that's exactly how government is.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about a couple of things that I found that weren't addressed in the budget, and some of them are very specific to the beautiful constituency of Argyle, its neighbour Yarmouth, its other neighbour of Barrington and the things that are happening in that part of the world.</p>
<p>First of all is the talk about support for the lobster fishery - didn't see too much in there. Hopefully, with our discussions with the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture we might be able to learn of some of the programs or processes that are in place. But as you know we've been experiencing record low prices when it comes to lobsters in Nova Scotia. We started off the season, back in December, somewhere near $3.50 a pound, which those of us who like to pop down to the wharf and buy a few lobsters that's not too bad, but if you're trying to run a business or an industry, $3.50 is far from the optimal amount - as a matter of fact, I did hear it was down past that, somewhere near $3 - and I've heard some cases of $2.75.</p>
<p>Definitely not something we should be looking forward to as an economy which is based principally in our neck of the woods on the lobster fishery. To explain the added problem that we had with it is that today lobsters are probably selling somewhere near $10 a pound because there are no landings at this point, so lobsters are a bit scarce. The old supply and demand rolls in and the prices go up and it creates a little bit of discussion amongst everybody in the community - it's why can't we get a better price at the start like we're getting today? Getting the $10 has been very difficult.</p>
<p>I've spoken to a number of fishermen over the last couple of days and they're lucky if they can get two, three crates out of a haul, going out all day. That's like 300 pounds at $10 - it'll pay the wages of the guys on the boat, it might pay your fuel, but it might not pay many of the other expenses on the boat. Hopefully we'll be able to hear a little more about the budget, the department, and maybe what this government's thought is around the lobster fishery.</p>
<p>I only have so much time, so I will move along. I have a long list of things I want to talk about. One issue that is a little related is because of the low prices there is an effort in some cases of looking for other species, in particular halibut.</p>
<p>My condolences go out to the families and friends in the community of Woods Harbour for those folks related to the boys who were on the <i>Miss Ally</i>. It was definitely a tremendous tragedy that happened to everyone in southwestern Nova Scotia who has that connection to the sea. Many times we talk about it, we see it, but it really hits home and every community can feel themselves in that kind of loss - whether you are in Wedgeport, Port Maitland, Liverpool, or the fishing ports near there - Port Mouton and those areas. You truly feel that as a community - to feel that loss, it is so tragic.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that over the next bit there will be some efforts to make sure this doesn't happen again. Southwestern Nova Scotia has lost six fishermen, six young fishermen, which is the tragic point - earlier in the season they had lost Michael Doucette in the Wedgeport area, so six young fishermen, some were friends and some of them had fished together many times. I hope that is not forgotten, but at the same time does have some benefit to the area by trying to stop deaths at sea.</p>
<p>Other things in the area that are continuing to be concerning, I had a good conversation the other day with Ian McNicol of Garian Construction, still looking for payment for the construction of the Centre Communitaire, or School Community Centre, in Tusket. Due to some issues with the South West Shore Development Authority, that organization, the Garian Construction, was shorted about $400,000 on that construction and still to this day is not getting a whole lot of information on how this can be rectified or whether or not the government is interested in participating in some kind of payment plan to try to get not only Garian Construction paid up but some of the subcontractors that were involved in it, during that process.</p>
<p>Southwest Nova Scotia is still impacted quite a bit by the loss of the ferry, the tourism traffic in the southwest is far from what it used to be and small organizations, small businesses, tourist shops, those things are still having trouble trying to find a raison d'&#xE9;tre, trying to find opportunities for the upcoming tourism season. As a matter of fact I was having the opportunity to chat with the owners of Privateers Sou'West, which is one of the only Harley-Davidson dealerships southwest of Halifax, and was really trying to make the decision whether to close it or not.</p>
<p>Knowing Gary Dixon and Ian McNicol, again, in this particular case, they are going to have to make a decision and put a number of people out of work because of that loss of revenue for the people who would pop in and pick up a T-shirt or pick up a piece of chrome. I don't know if you know a lot of the Harley-Davidson owners but it's all about the ride. It's all about the trip and when you have an opportunity like a Harley shop to stop in on, that meant $2,500 to $3,000 a day that ended up being lost. I wish them very well, I hope the decision is to keep it open, but I can totally understand why they would be making a decision to close.</p>
<p>Other things that are concerning southwest Nova Scotia - Nakile Home for Special Care is in its, I think, third tender process. I think everybody's fingers and toes are crossed that when the tenders do come in that it will be a tender that is affordable to the Department of Health and Wellness. Originally, when our government announced the reconstruction or the expansion of Nakile Home for Special Care, there was a 22-bed expansion. That got knocked down by this government to a 12-bed expansion and continues to be a struggle as the tendering process follows along. So of course, fingers crossed, I plead to the Minister of Health and Wellness that when those tenders do come available that he looks at them closely in making sure those 12 beds are built in Argyle, for all residents in southwest Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>An issue that the Minister of Health and Wellness should also be looking at in southwest Nova Scotia is the issue of Bayside Home. There is an issue there, and I think maybe along with the minister, the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education could look at an issue that has been going on there. I don't know whether it has been solved. My last discussion, last week, around it has to do with a labour order that they have. Apparently Bayside Home, when it was built, did not have an air conditioning unit put in. Of course staff have put a number of complaints in that it's too hot to do the work. Labour has come in and said it's too hot to do the work, that of course Bayside has to go and install an air conditioning unit. Unfortunately what's happening is the Department of Health and Wellness is saying no, you can't have the air conditioning unit. I'm just wondering if there is a resolve there between the two departments, Department of Labour and the Department of Health and Wellness, on finding the extra funding to provide some kind of air handling, air conditioning, so that not only the residents have a temperature but hopefully that the workers, the care workers, at Bayside Homes will have the right environment to work in.</p>
<p>Of course, the issue that continues to be chatted about in southwestern Nova Scotia is the issue of boundaries for the next election and how that had been totally mishandled by the government of the time. Maybe, had there been a little more focus on it, the outcome might have been different. Of course, that is the splitting of Shelburne County and the issue of not having designated Acadian representation in the House after the next election. So that continues to be a concern in southwest Nova Scotia, and one that I think will turn into a bit of a discussion during the next election, whenever that may be called.</p>
<p>I think the biggest issue that we have with the budget as it was presented revolved around the revenue projections of the Province of Nova Scotia - the $300 million that they'll be taking from taxpayers this year, borrowing more than $113 dollars in their name once again. So it's a very expensive time for Nova Scotians, as the Government of Nova Scotia goes out and tries to take just a little bit more in order to balance its budget. Again, those revenue projections - as we're talking to Nova Scotians, they're saying, well, I want a little more proof that this is a balanced budget. Nobody believes it at this point, and I'm hoping that through the next discussion we'll be able to find it.</p>
<p>One concerning thing was on my way out on Friday, as I headed home. We've said a lot of times that this government doesn't necessarily govern, but it likes to market things, whether it's talking about the issues of Better Care Sooner or talking about jobsHere.</p>
<p>On my way home on Friday, listening to Q104, I hear a radio ad from the Province of Nova Scotia - I'll table a copy, but I will read it - and again, I'm wondering how much this cost. Here we go, we're barely balancing the budget, and the minister stood up and basically said it's going to be tough over the next bit in order to maintain that balance, yet here they are, spending money on advertising once again.</p></speech>

            <p>All weekend.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>All weekend, thank you. Of course I went home and I didn't hear it on my radio station, but I'm going to bet that it was on a number of outlets here in the city.</p>
<p>It reads, "This year's provincial budget has benefits for families, seniors, and students that help make life and school a little more affordable. There are also benefits for small business owners that will help grow our economy and create jobs for Nova Scotians. From tax breaks to continued and expanded programs, find out what's in the budget for you at NovaScotia.ca. A message from the Province of Nova Scotia."</p>
<p>I don't know why they don't say "a message from the New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia," because that's exactly what that is. That is a big piece of political advertising that they should be ashamed of putting on the radio. That is something that, of course, neither of the Opposition Parties are able to do at this point. Why don't they just go into their own coffers and try to sell stuff like that? Mr. Speaker, I'm going to table that.</p>
<p>They should be ashamed of having to try to sell their own budget. If it can't stand on its own, there must be a problem with it. Why do they have to advertise it? Maybe they don't believe it's balanced either. That's what I'm hearing across the province - it doesn't matter where I go.</p>
<p>A quick thing that I read on the weekend - which I thought was quite interesting, and I'll close with that one - was an article in the Amherst Daily News, put forward by the member for Timberlea-Prospect, and it had to do with the trust funds of the Liberal Party. I thought I would quote one piece out of it and table it, and anybody who wants a copy, I'm sure you can just ask for a copy of it as well.</p>
<p>I'm just going to read this part here: "Party records released in subsequent annual reports showed a different story. Just before voting for the NDP legislation" - I'm going to have to substitute - the Leader of the Liberals "and the Liberals transferred $365,000 out of the tainted funds and into their Party's unrestricted account, making the Leader another in a long line of Liberal Leaders who could not say no to money gained through tainted means."</p>
<p>So this is an interesting article that I'm quoting from, and - no, it's actually written by the member for Timberlea-Prospect, and I think he did a marvellous job of explaining it. I think that it does put a whole bunch of people on here. Of course, Parker wrote a little bit in this - Parker Barss Donham, columnist Stephen Kimber. It was a pretty darn good article.</p>
<p>I'm going to table that for everyone to have a quick look at, as we move into budgets. (Interruptions) I'm hearing from the Liberals that they don't like that either.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's an honour for me to stand and address the House prior to going into the estimates, estimates that I think not only will Nova Scotians be proud of, but our Party is extremely proud of the budget that we just tabled.</p>
<p>It's quite interesting to stand and listen to the Opposition Party, especially the member for Argyle, who had his turn of governing in this province, Mr. Speaker. It's interesting to hear some of the comments. When we came into power in 2009, we were left a financial mess. That has burdened a lot of the things that we could not do or achieve, but Nova Scotians recognize that. I've spent a lot of time in my community talking with individuals from organizations, people who recognized the financial situation of the province in 2009 and they voted for change, even though in my community I've had the fortunate opportunity to be re-elected three times in three general elections. I have an opportunity to represent part of the province that has seen the light for many, many years and has returned an NDP MLA in this House of Assembly for over 25 years.</p>
<p>They understand the hard work that our Party has put in over the last decades and decades of trying to ensure that government acts responsibly. As an Opposition member, when I was first elected in 2003, but more importantly, as a government, I know through the conversations I've had over the last almost four years as government that the people in my area respect the job that we had to do over the last four years; they recognize that we had to make some difficult choices as we entered into office.</p>
<p>I know the Premier has said this on a number of occasions and I'll say it again - for a first-time government, 2009 was probably not the best time to come in and try to govern any province, Mr. Speaker. We know that across Canada, across North America, for that matter across the world, the financial situation that we've seen for a number of years has really impaired the actions of government across Canada and across the world.</p>
<p>The recession we were in really took a toll not only on governments, but on businesses and on individual citizens, especially in our province. When I talk to Nova Scotians who live in my community, they recognize the hard work that we had to put in over the last three years to try to get to the point where we were proud to table a budget, a balanced budget, no matter what the Liberals and Tories say - a balanced budget, Mr. Speaker, something we haven't seen in a few years. It has been after hard, hard work, work from each and every minister, hard work from every member of our caucus to bring forward solutions, bring forward ideas to try to turn the ship around. We've done that and I'm very proud of the work that our Party has done over the last four years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I represent a great community, not too far from the city but a community made up of great individuals and a number of great organizations that really contribute a lot to the community and to our province. So I'll take this time for a few minutes just to talk about some of the impact that I think the work that we have done over the last three or four years will have on those individuals in my community. First of all, we have a number of organizations that work extremely hard to provide services for local residents, when an individual might fall through the cracks or might not be able to gain access to a service, for example.</p>
<p>One thing I realized really early after becoming elected in 2003 is that the programs that are available to Nova Scotians through government programs don't always meet the needs of those individuals. So we have organizations across the province, I'm sure in everybody's community, that kind of pick up and fill those gaps, organizations like the Kinsmen Centre in my community, an amazing group of men and women. The Kinsmen Centre and the Kinettes work extremely hard to raise money to provide services for individuals, to provide wheelchairs, and really try to make a difference in the lives of the people in our community, not only in Lower Sackville but in the surrounding areas. I'm very proud to know many of them and I'm very proud of the work that they've done over the last number of years to support residents in my community.</p>
<p>We also have the Lions Club that also works extremely hard. I think we have one member in our caucus, the member for Timberlea-Prospect, who is a proud Lions member himself; I know he has worked extremely hard, in his area of the province, to support fellow Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>We also have Acadia Hall, which has been a staple of our community for over 100 years. It was the first community centre in our community and today their members work extremely hard to continue on with the legacy of those, who for over 100 years, have contributed greatly to our community. They do amazing work so I want to thank them also.</p>
<p>We also have an organization that really tries to promote our history and that is the Fultz House Museum. They work extremely hard to ensure that people who come or who are new to our community know our history, know that Sackville was once a thriving - still thriving - but once a thriving agricultural area with livestock and many farms. Now you drive through it, it's very much subdivisions and houses and it's a suburb of Halifax. They work really hard at Fultz House Museum to ensure we continue to know our history, appreciate our history, and really promote the history of our community.</p>
<p>We also have organizations that try to improve the environment. We have the Friends of First Lake who work hard on some trail development around First Lake. They've worked hard over the years to ensure that the community is a good steward of the environment, when it comes to the cleanliness and healthiness of First Lake. Far too often, back in the 1970s, when development really took off in our area, a lot of the runoff and pollution went into First Lake and for many years it was quite polluted. Friends of First Lake work extremely hard, with local residents and other organizations, to improve the quality of the water itself in First Lake and improve the surrounding areas with trail development.</p>
<p>Another organization that has worked hard over the last number of years is the Second Lake Park Association. These men and women have worked hard to protect the lake and the land around Second Lake and they've worked really hard over the last number of years. I was introduced to the organization, just before my first election in 2003, by our former MLA, John Holm, who really ensured that I recognized the importance of moving that file forward. It was the file of trying to protect the area around First Lake. There are well over 700 acres there now that have been moved under the park reserve designation, under the Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>I want to commend the Department of Natural Resources and the minister for the work that they've done over the last four years, but even before that, on working with the association to improve the protection of that area that I think is so important to do. They've also contributed to some trail development and it's amazing to be not too far out of downtown Halifax and realize there are 700 acres of treed land there, around a lake that has less than 10 homes on it. It's amazing to see that is possible today because of the sheer amount of development that we've seen in and around HRM.</p>
<p>We know in Fall River and Beaver Bank, Upper Sackville, and throughout the old county, development was very much go-forward at an accelerated rate. Second Lake Park - the lands that are in the reserve - that was actually under the former Department of Housing and slated to be developed. I'm glad to be able to work, over the last 10 years in my capacity as the MLA, to ensure that we have continued protection to that and I look forward to working with the Minister of Natural Resources, as we move forward, to ensuring that we protect that land for our kids and our grandkids.</p>
<p>Another organization in my community that works extremely hard is the Legion. We have, I think, one of the fastest growing Legions, Calais Branch 162, in Nova Scotia. They work extremely hard to provide services for our veterans, and it is an organization that is close to my heart. I applaud the work that they do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In this budget, as I said - if I needed to say it again to make sure the members opposite are listening - this balanced budget we introduced last week was extremely important. In that, and in our achievements, we've been able to look at finally trying to improve services, or expand services, within the budget. I'm very proud to say - especially being Minister of Health and Wellness - that in the budget we have some initiatives that will be very important to Nova Scotians, and especially our young Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>I know how important diabetes care is for many, many Nova Scotians. I think everybody in this Legislature knows somebody who has diabetes. We recognize that, and we've worked extremely hard - and I've worked extremely hard as a member, and as the Minister of Health and Wellness - to ensure that we are in a position to look at the opportunity to provide additional support for those individuals with diabetes in our province. So I'm glad to see that there is a provision in our budget that will see the province's first insulin pump program for children. I'm very proud of that.</p>
<p>Not only that, this insulin pump program will reach those children 18 and under, and we recognize that many of those children who get to the ages of 19 to 25 fall off their parents' third-party insurance program that might cover insulin pumps, or at least the supplies. That's why we made a provision in the program that we'll be introducing to allow 19- to 25-year-olds to claim and support them with their supply, something that is extremely important.</p>
<p>We're very proud of the work we've done, not only to achieve a balanced budget, but to move forward in an appropriate way, really transforming health care and health care delivery in the province. We've seen in the past attempts to do this which have failed, Mr. Speaker; they've failed miserably. We've seen - and I said this before, and I know they do not like me bringing this up - a Liberal Government try to reform health care, but they did it in the wrong way. I was a health care provider in the 1990s, and the approach that they took was just simply wrong.</p>
<p>Then we turn to 10 years of Progressive Conservative Government, who really didn't do anything. They put out fires once in a while, but they didn't bring any new initiatives forward.</p>
<p>I'm very proud to be part of a government - and I thank the former Minister of Health and Wellness for bringing forward and introducing Nova Scotians to a new model of care for emergency rooms, for example. Collaborative Emergency Centres have been well received in our province, and well received across the country. I've had the honour and privilege to attend meetings with federal, provincial, and territorial Health Ministers who are all looking at our model of care here in Nova Scotia, and I'm very proud that we were able to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know I only have a couple of minutes. I'd like to finish off with the comments from the member for Argyle who just mentioned our opportunity to tell Nova Scotians about these changes. As I said in Question Period, if Nova Scotians don't know about the changes, then they are not going to access the service. It's interesting that the member for Argyle - as recently as February 3, 2009, under the former government when he was in government - stated, "I don't think government as a whole does a good job of (promotion). Not enough Nova Scotians know what kind of programs are out there &#x2026; I don't think we spend enough time explaining or advertising or getting those programs out there."</p>
<p>Unbelievable. Unbelievable, and I'll table that. One of the things in the Ross report, which was produced by Dr. John Ross, was the fact that we needed to tell Nova Scotians about these changes so they can gain access to these programs. That's exactly what we did.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>Hon. Christopher d'Entremont</from><p>I hereby give notice that on a future day I shall move the adoption of the following resolution:</p>
<p>Whereas power rates in Nova Scotia are the highest in the country and are putting families, small businesses, and large industrials in serious economic distress; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Liberals have chosen to base their energy policy on a failed experiment that was abandoned in other provinces for driving up energy costs and being impractical; and</p>
<p>Whereas Nova Scotians deserve affordable energy that will not bankrupt future generations or put additional undue strain on our fragile economy;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House of Assembly condemn the Liberal Party for not having the experience necessary to know that their expensive electricity policy will drive up energy costs and endanger Nova Scotia's economy.</p></speech>
