<p>Mr. Speaker, we know that last year labour and income growth was at a slower pace than was observed during the recession in 2009, so think about that: labour income growth was at a slower pace than was observed during the recession of 2009. When you think about that, remember his answer in the last question.</p>
<p>Population has slowed, retail sales are the weakest since the recession, and inflation has been faster than the national average - none of the data points to a spike in personal income tax, so how does the Premier expect that there is going to be such a high level of tax revenue in the coming year?</p></speech>

MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think what the Auditor General said is that he had no opinion when it came to the revenue assumptions that the government was going to try to achieve. What he has been saying now for months is that this government had a $27 million mistake in the previous budget, which they knew about when they stood in this House and tabled the budget - he has also raised the issue that that's why Nova Scotians have some concerns about anything coming out of this government because, quite frankly, it's hard to believe.</p>
<p>This government has said that we'll have a slower economy (Interruptions) I'm not sure, Mr. Speaker, I don't know if they want to talk or you want me to finish my question.</p>
<p>The government has said that we will have a slower economy, higher unemployment, and greater exposure to international risk, so how can the Premier tell Nova Scotians that we'll have a 7 per cent surge in income tax revenue next year?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. In fact every rating agency says that in terms of economic growth after 20 years of the worst economic growth in the country we are now going to move into the middle of the pack. You are going to see many new projects starting this year, whether it's the investment in the offshore - people only have to look around Halifax to see that there are more than 30 building cranes over Halifax right now, major projects on the way. On top of all that, if we didn't need anything else, on top of all that Statistics Canada reported just last month a growth of 5,600 full-time jobs in Nova Scotia.</p>

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Look, the answer to the Liberal Party Leader's question is that the budget contained a hidden tax increase as a result of bracket creep - it's going to yield them tens of millions of dollars. That is part of what Nova Scotians are discovering about the NDP: it's very expensive to live in NDP Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when in Opposition the member for Halifax Fairview said of bracket creep that it is "&#x2026; as much of a tax grab as if the Minister of Finance reached into your pocket, or into your wallet or into your purse and took out the money." I will table that quote for the benefit of the Premier.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, $300 more per person out of the pockets of each and every Nova Scotian this year as a result of the budget last week. My question to the Premier is, how is reaching into the pockets of Nova Scotians through more hidden taxes, and for another $300 a year, a balanced plan?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party should reflect on the fact that the budget of Nova Scotia with respect of income tax used to be linked with the federal government, and I believe when he was chief of staff for the former government they decoupled from the federal income tax rules specifically so that they would not have to pay any increase with respect to inflation and with respect to the so-called bracket creep. I would say, to quote a much more famous person than I, that if he has a problem with this he should start by looking at the man in the mirror.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, if the Premier is going to give us a history lesson, he should at least check the history books before he does, because the government at that time decoupled from the federal government because the federal Liberal Government of the day was raising taxes and we didn't want to have any of that here in Nova Scotia.

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there is no question that budgets are about choices, and we watched for years while the Progressive Conservative Governments made choices. They increased their budgetary spending by hundreds of millions of dollars and then overspent it by hundreds of millions of dollars. This created a situation in this province where there was no elasticity in our budget whatsoever; in fact when the financial crisis hit in 2009 and essentially washed away the budgets of provinces, states and jurisdictions, not only across North America but across the world, it meant that now budgets had to be rebuilt - which is what we did in this province.</p>
<p>In the first opportunity that we have to balance the books and to make sure that it's balanced not only financially but socially, we decided to refund the taxes for lowest income seniors. I think that was the right choice.</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, if the Premier was serious about balancing the budget in all the ways that it means, he wouldn't have repealed the balanced budget law that was on the books of Nova Scotia when he came in so he could table all those deficit budgets and raise the taxes on each and every single Nova Scotian, taking with one hand and giving a little bit back with the other.</p>
<p>The Nova Scotian economy is struggling and jobs are being lost because we have the highest taxes in all of Canada. In the meantime the Premier's response is to spend ever more money bailing out large companies and others with Nova Scotia's hard-earned tax dollars. It reminds me of something that Margaret Thatcher once said when she said "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."</p>

We know there has been a shift from full-time to part-time employment for workers in Nova Scotia.

<p>The budget states quite clearly that growth and nominal GDP is expected to be 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 3 per cent in 2014. Population is lagging behind the rest of the country as well, Mr. Speaker, and of course labour income growth last year was slower than what was observed during the recession. All of these things affect the tax base but yet with all these weak indicators, the Premier and the government expect a surge in personal income tax revenue in the coming year.</p>
<p>My question, will the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism tell Nova Scotians how provincial income tax revenue can be expected to grow at a rate of 7 per cent in the medium term when nominal GDP growth rates are forecast to be 2.3 per cent and 3 per cent respectively in the next two years?</p></speech>

Subsidizing Tim Hortons is not spending on health care so I will ask the Premier, will the Premier finally cancel the Tim Hortons subsidy and direct that money back into actual front-line health care?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I guess like many people, I saw the story that was on CTV, I believe, at the time. I asked some questions about it and it turned out that the information that was being conveyed to the public was, in fact, incorrect. In fact, some of those franchises make a profit. For the information of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, I'm going to table the budget breakdown for this that actually shows that there was a small deficit of about $12,000 between all of the franchises. I would also remind the Leader that it is because that franchise does not sell any of the usual products from Tim Hortons. In fact, it's a healthy food outlet for people waiting for either loved ones or those who are in the hospital. No matter what kind of a kitchen or cafeteria you have, they run at a deficit and this one runs at a very small one.</p>

BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier might want to check the business plans of his own Capital District Health Authority because for four years in a row they have begged the government to stop subsidizing those outlets so they could use that money for actual health care.</p>
<p>In Newfoundland and Labrador, they had the exact same situation, $1.5 million subsidizing Tim Hortons in their hospitals but they did the right thing. The health board CEO in Newfoundland and Labrador, Ms. Kaminski, says, "We cannot continue to subsidize those non-direct care services, when we know that they can be provided more effectively and efficiently and we can apply that money [elsewhere]." I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier. I will ask the Premier again, will he accept the commonsense approach of Ms. Kaminski and the Newfoundland and Labrador health board and stop bailing out the hospital Tim Hortons so that money can go where it actually belongs, real health care?</p></speech>

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's an odd thing because the decision to put the Tim Hortons in there belonged to the hospital and to the district health authority. They were the ones who made the decision at the time. They continue to make these decisions. The only thing that we had said is that they're not going to affect the livelihood of the employees who work there, who support their families through the jobs they have there. They're not going to contract those out simply to run down the wages of a few poor people who happen to work there at decent jobs. We're not going to allow that to happen. We care about those people.</p>
<p>This is a very small deficit in the Tim Hortons franchise there and it's not even all of them, some of them make surpluses. I understand that this question was motivated by the stories that appeared. I think maybe he ought to just rethink his line of questioning.</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in the Premier's first answer he says no, we're not really subsidizing them and then in his second answer he defends the very subsidy that he denied in the first answer. Do you know what people want? They want spending on doctors and nurses, they want more money for those things, not a defence of the subsidy of the Tim Hortons at our hospitals. It shouldn't take a surgeon to know that if you cut that subsidy, you can put that money, $1.5 million, into actual health care - you could do more insulin pumps, you could do more CF screening. You could do a lot more things with that money if you'd stop subsidizing the Tim Hortons.</p>
<p>I'll ask the Premier, will he explain to the people of Nova Scotia why he insists on continuing that subsidy, when that money could go to actual health care?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thought I explained to him that obviously there is not a subsidy there; in fact there is a very small deficit being run, I think in one of the locations. I also explained to him that this was a decision that was made by the district health authority because they were trying to cut costs associated with other operations that they took on.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what we are doing is ensuring that the people who work there do not become the scapegoats in this story and have them and their families penalized because they make $12 an hour giving services to patients in hospitals and their loved ones. We're not going to penalize them for doing their jobs.</p></speech>

We are just into debate on the budget now, as we know, but I already have a recommendation for the minister, so new into this budget year, to save money. The hospital in Inverness needs a CT scan. It will save over $700,000 a year in transport costs of shipping patients down to Sydney. In a year and a half it will pay for itself, and from then on it will start saving the government upward of $700,000 a year in transportation costs. Will the minister act to make the purchase of this CT scan?</p>

            <p>That's exactly what we're doing. When we came into government in 2009 we had, the Department of Health and Wellness and the Province of Nova Scotia, had one of the, if not the highest costs for health administration in the country. We've worked hard to reduce that to today we're below the national average.

<p>The physicians caring for people at the hospital need the CT scan. The average age of the population on the western side of Cape Breton is in an age category that has the highest instances for stroke, and the earlier stroke is identified and addressed when it happens the better the outcome for the patient - and that's going to save the government money as well in reduced care costs. The community has raised $2 million and we need the CT scan to recruit future physicians - why is the minister delaying the decision which has obvious benefits for everyone involved?</p></speech>

            <p>We have a process in place that allows district health authorities to come forward with their requests to the department with the equipment that they need, with the services that they want. I'm very proud of our commitment to work with the district health authorities to find those health administrative costs, for one, and we recognize the importance of having those decisions made on the local level. That's why we're committed, unlike the Progressive Conservative Government who would rather have those decisions made in Halifax. We're not going to take that route, we're going to ensure local decisions are made, they're going to bring their request forward to the Department of Health and Wellness. We have a process and a committee in place that will evaluate that and, as we are able to ensure and provide the funds for those pieces of equipment around the province, we're going to do that.</p>

The difference between us, as a government, and the Opposition, is that they don't have confidence in our police, that they don't have confidence in our Public Prosecution; they don't have confidence in our court.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to speak on the bill. These amendments relate to the compensation received by members of this House. As my colleagues know, the House of Assembly Act requires that you, Mr. Speaker, must appoint an independent tribunal to review members' salaries within 60 days of an election. The amendments we are discussing today will broaden the scope of that review quite considerably. The review will not only include salaries but it will also include housing allowances, constituency allowances, pensions, and all other types of reimbursements pursuant to the House of Assembly Management Commission Act and all retiring allowances payable to members of the House, pursuant to the Members' Retiring Allowances Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think everyone in this Chamber would agree that Nova Scotians deserve accountability and transparency from their elected officials. As my government made clear in the Speech from the Throne, we must work to ensure that we are protecting the pillars of democracy and keeping pace with the expectations of our citizens. That is why we've committed to a full and thorough review of every form of compensation that members of the House receive.</p>
<p>By expanding this review to include everything at once, Mr. Speaker, we are ensuring that the benefits members receive are fair, responsible, and independently determined by an objective review panel. This is the level of accountability that Nova Scotians expect from us and it's the accountability we are committing to with this piece of legislation.</p>
<p>There is also another item to this legislation that I must draw your attention to. As I mentioned earlier, the current House of Assembly Act requires that you appoint a panel within 60 days of an election and that the panel report back to this House within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>As the amendments we are discussing today are expansive and require an extension on the deadline, Mr. Speaker, under the new legislation you will be required to appoint a three-person review panel on or before December 31<sup>st</sup> - that is the end of this month - and the panel to submit its report to you by the end of March of next year. In other words, they will have about three months to complete their work. The legislation will also allow you to grant the panel an extension, if you deem it necessary.</p>
<p>I think my colleagues would agree that the most important thing here is not to do the review quickly but to do it correctly, so we want to give this panel the time they need to do their work thoroughly and completely.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know all my colleagues in this House are committed to serving their constituents to the best of their abilities and I believe this legislation is the important and proper step to assure Nova Scotians that we are holding ourselves accountable, that we are being fiscally responsible in our use of public funds and that we are devoted to serving the public good.</p>
<p>I look forward to the debate on this legislation and I look forward to seeing it receive the unanimous support of this House. I'm sure you will also be pleased, Mr. Speaker, to have the opportunity to appoint the panel for this important work. With those words I will take my seat. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>The Town of Yarmouth has sent a letter to the Premier indicating that the situation has reached a critical point in Yarmouth and we are at risk of losing more of our tourism infrastructure. We have already lost half of our rooms in Yarmouth since this government's decision to cut the ferry and we risk losing even more.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this government is well aware of the tourism industry, not only in southwest Nova Scotia but right across this province. This government has made significant investments to assist tourism in the southwest region. I read a resolution today about the Hockey Challenge, those are two significant investments that we made in the southwest region to bring people in. I think about the Rodd Hotel in southwest Nova Scotia, another investment that we made in the area of tourism in the Province of Nova Scotia. When I hear the member talk about investments, and certainly in the ferry, we love nothing more than seeing a strong, viable ferry operation in southwest Nova Scotia.</p>

The reason why that money was given to the Grand Hotel was because our last hotel, that one, was going to close without that money covering their losses. They lost money because the ferry was gone. We are having other tourism operations that are on the brink of closure. We have lost over 400 rooms since that NDP cut the ferry service.</p>
<p>We have a tourism sector on the brink of collapse and we need this government to step up to the plate and support it, so that when a ferry comes back, we have rooms for people to stay here, plain and simple, that's it. Ask the owners of Pictou Lodge how much the ferry meant to them. They lost 700 rooms annually because of this government's decision. Ask the operators in Baddeck, who lost 20 to 30 per cent of their business, what the ferry meant to them. Ask the operators in Shelburne, who've lost 50 per cent of their business.

<p>After hearing from many Nova Scotian businesses across the province, we committed to making changes to first contract arbitration. Our business operators should be able to focus on employing Nova Scotians, growing their businesses, and giving back to their communities. It is in everyone's best interest when employers, employees, and unions can resolve their differences through collective bargaining and without labour disruptions.</p>
<p>We are following through on our commitment to restore balance and responsibility to first contract arbitration. The existing legislation involves the Labour Board too quickly. It gives the parties automatic access to first contract arbitration simply by running out a 120-day clock. We said we would fix these problems and that's what we're doing.</p>
<p>Amending the Trade Union Act will ensure the Labour Board can only impose a first contract agreement if it determines one of the parties is not making its best effort to reach a first agreement. The changes will remove the time limits on conciliation and eliminate automatic access to first contract arbitration, giving employers and employees more time to try to negotiate affordable agreements.</p>
<p>The conciliator must now determine that the parties are at an impasse before the matter can go to the Labour Board. If the Labour Board finds the parties are making their best effort to bargain, it may direct the parties back to conciliation. But if the Labour Board determines the parties qualify for first contract arbitration, it can appoint an outside arbitrator or the parties can choose to appear before the Labour Board and cover their own costs. These amendments will restore balance to the process. They will bring Nova Scotia's legislation more in line with the model used by the federal government and several other provinces.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, in the rare instances when employers, employees, and unions struggle to negotiate a first agreement, a more balanced process will be in place to help. These changes ensure that first contract arbitration is a tool of last resort.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, two years ago members of the business communities spoke out against Bill No. 102. Luc Erjavec of the Restaurant and Food Services Association was one of those people. He said the business community was galvanized against this first contract legislation two years ago, and when we introduced these amendments last week, Mr. Erjavec said he was pleased to see the changes we were proposing. He said the amendments are a positive signal to the business community. He said this government listened and acted quickly to bring Nova Scotia's first contract process more in line with other Canadian jurisdictions.</p>

GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>I certainly appreciate this opportunity, going into Supply, to speak about an important issue for me and for many members in the Legislature, as we are, after all, the Province of Nova Scotia and the provincial government have a very serious situation on their hands and that is with respect to the economy in our native Cape Breton. We heard the Speech from the Throne read by the Lieutenant Governor to open up the session and it was based on hope. It was based on prosperity and turning the corner and that seems to be the line that is going to lead this government into the election and that is the pre-election banter that we are hearing. We are turning into what I've always noticed in my time here in the Legislature is that the government takes issues and takes important things and turns them into a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>I think that's where we are with this Speech From the Throne. However, I don't want to belabour that today, Mr. Speaker, because the issue with Cape Breton and the unemployment rate is too important to spend time talking about that - I've got to talk about the Island and what we're seeing on the ground.</p>
<p>I'm going to paint the picture for the members of the House with respect to the Cape Breton economy and what's happening on the ground here. First of all, I have to say I mentioned the 18.6 per cent. It's an alarming rate and when I asked the question of the minister today about the unemployment rate in Cape Breton his response was to read an excerpt from a Halifax Chamber of Commerce line that was put into the public, so it was certainly disappointing.</p>
<p>I would hope that with such an important portfolio and one that we're seeing - I mean the numbers represent what's happening on the ground and I just wish that the minister would be more engaged with these files, and rather than reading the rhetorical talking point, really give an answer. If it's 18.6 per cent in Cape Breton, things are tough and that's obvious but we've got to get some kind of answers from this government on what the approach is when you're looking at 18.6 per cent growth. Obviously they've had an objective outlook on the economy and our economic prospects looking forward. Well, if that's the case, then let's do something for Cape Breton and let's amp it up here.</p>
<p>One thing I want to make very clear is that there's no "poor us" mentality in Cape Breton - that's not the mindset of people. People are working, they're looking for work, they're doing their very best to survive, as the Cape Breton MLAs would certainly see that on a daily basis. So the alarm and the concern is not necessarily coming only from the residents of Cape Breton, it's coming from those elected representatives of all levels of government.</p>
<p>Certainly we've all been speaking on this issue and when these numbers came out via Statistics Canada, the job outlook is not good at all, it's very troubling for Cape Breton. It's a crisis; we are in crisis mode. I don't think that's crying foul or overstating the significance. If you look at two very key numbers, obviously the unemployment rate of 18.6 per cent, Mr. Speaker, a very troubling number itself, but when you look at the amount of Cape Bretoners who are working out West, on a two-week-on, two-week-off, three- week-on, one-week-off kind of rotation, they figure into employment numbers so they are employed as long as they obviously have a Cape Breton address, which they do because they travel back and forth - ask the Sydney airport, they can tell you what kind of traffic has increased there with this phenomenon of working West and coming home to see your family and be home at the Cape.</p>
<p>If you took those numbers and looked at what they mean, you're really looking at one-quarter of Cape Bretoners who are unemployed. That's 25 per cent unemployed and, Mr. Speaker, that excludes the participation rate which people are leaving the labour force every day, so if they're not looking they don't even factor in these numbers. Believe me, in Glace Bay there are lots of those, as there are in many other parts of the Island. So it's very concerning - 18.6 per cent.</p>
<p>Again, another important piece to remember - that's the average for the Island so that's not looking at some of the remote communities that would have even higher unemployment than that. So very concerning and that's something that we've got to tackle as a province, and as an economy that's important.</p>
<p>Of course there's the issue and the concern of out-migration. I was looking at some of the population numbers and it's staggering that we've lost 3,000 over the last three or four years - 6,000 since the late 1990s. Mr. Speaker, you are hit with that in your community, and we all feel the impact of that. It's something that when you lose that amount of people over such a short time in the snapshot of history - you know, 15 years is not that long a time - your community loses a bit of its identity. I think that anyone that sort of faces that kind of out-migration, coupled with the unemployment, can feel that every day. I feel it at the restaurants and down on Commercial Street, at sporting events and those types of things. Families just aren't around unless you hope to hook them on a good rotation where everybody is home and that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>The reality is that our society is changing and it's becoming very bleak, and the prospects are bleak. Again, the Cape Breton mentality is to soldier on, and we're not crying "poor us," but there are some things that we can do as a province. I think that with the challenges, there are certainly opportunities, Mr. Speaker. I just want to talk quickly about some of those things.</p>
<p>Certainly a fragile economy, looking across the board and the outlooks as we viewed some of the numbers today in Question Period, the outlooks for growth and for employment stability aren't looking too favourable, and obviously those pressures hit all parts of Nova Scotia, the metro area and Halifax being the most shielded from those - but when you look at the fragility of Cape Breton, you have to look at some of the additional pressures. First of all, we've got immense pressures in terms of our crumbling infrastructure. The CBRM has been identified to bear the costs, or will have to bear the costs, of 20 per cent of the Atlantic Canada Wastewater requirements for infrastructure - 20 per cent of that $454 million has to be paid for by, and is the responsibility of, the CBRM, so it's very important. Our streets are in extreme decay. Sidewalks are crumbling. Some of the wastewater infrastructure we have under the ground is a century old. We have to look at that and make sure those things are being considered.</p>
<p>Community infrastructure, one of the treasures of the province, in my - biased, of course - opinion, would be the Miners' Museum with the underground mine and the many great histories. It's alive. You walk into the old building and you can feel the presence of the miners. Those who do the tours represent it well, but that place needs a facelift. The Savoy Theatre would be up there with the same sort of requirements, but the coffers are empty for the CBRM. These are things that we have to address if we're going to sustain our communities.</p>
<p>Energy prices. It's no secret, we've talked about the social aspect of energy prices many times. They hit people's pocketbooks, but of course they hit businesses, and they have been identified as some of the key costs for small businesses. How do you grow an economy that is struggling, that has 18.6 per cent unemployment at the best case scenario, with energy costs that are a severe impediment to business growth and business stability? It certainly becomes an issue for entrepreneurs who are looking to expand or even start up.</p>
<p>The education cuts that have taken place - the reality is that the first concern with those cuts is obviously the classroom, and that has an impact, again, when you're talking about such a fragile economy. Education cuts take people out of the workforce. It bumps back those young, educated teachers who are graduating from CBU, from the Mount, from St. F.X., from Memorial, who want to teach and want to live home. When you see those reductions, there's obviously less need for teachers, and those substitute lists get longer. People give up and they go out West and work in Alberta in the oil patch, rather than using what they've been educated to do. Obviously, the staff and the outside workers and all those support employees for the school boards feel this as well, so certainly that impacts our economy, and we're feeling it, without question.</p>
<p>We have two significantly-sized projects in Cape Breton that are wrapping up in the not-too-distant future. A tremendous number of skilled trades and skilled individuals, who are making a pretty good wage, will be removed from our workforce. One of those is the Devco remediation project. As we all know, the Devco sites and the Devco properties have been remediated. They've been slowly piecing them off and putting them into community developments. That's about to sunset, as is the tar ponds cleanup. So that's two significant industrial-sized operations that will be coming to an end very shortly. They are cause for concern. We're now 18.6 per cent, best case scenario. What happens when those two initiatives go away? It's going to hurt.</p>
<p>Finally, not to be understated is the impact of EI cuts. These EI cuts are going to be devastating, and I certainly know that the Cape Breton MLAs from the PC Party are concerned about those as well. I'm hoping the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party will take issue with this and take this fight to Ottawa, because this is going to hurt Cape Breton. There's not a person in Cape Breton who doesn't feel the impacts of those already. I've got teaching assistants; I've got people connected with education; certainly seasonal workers of all stripes are concerned about how this is going to affect them. If they have a short layoff or they draw EI to sustain their households, then what happens if they have to go search for work? They're being investigated to see if they've actually done that search. It's pretty troubling.</p>
<p>We have to continue to fight that, although with the federal majority it doesn't look like Atlantic Canada is on the priority list for that. The national shift of the workforce out West only supports that, because people, when they're fed up and they're at their wits' end, they go take a trade or industrial training and they jump into the patch. That's what they have to do for their families to survive, and it's understandable. I think those EI cuts were applied hastily, and I think we shouldn't be punishing seasonal workers in Nova Scotia, and that's just the reality of it. That has hit Cape Breton pretty hard.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, How much time do I have left?</p></speech>
        <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise to speak about Bill No. 19.</p>
<p>As all members know, the Progressive Conservative caucus led the charge against first contract arbitration when the NDP imposed it in 2011. Back then we believed it was a bad bill, and our opinion hasn't changed.</p>
<p>It's a bill that solves a problem that doesn't exist. We are fortunate in this province to have a history of relative labour peace - there is no persistent or ongoing labour discontent; the province had 20 years of a fair and balanced labour market. First contract arbitration is a bill that endangers our already shaky economy, as we all witness on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Back in 2011 we heard what the province's largest employers thought about first contract arbitration - and they didn't like it and they still don't.</p>
<p>Sobeys vice-president of Human Resources called first contract arbitration "totally unnecessary" and said it would damage the province's reputation as an excellent place to work and to carry on business. Mr. Speaker, I will table that document.</p>
<p>Dana LeBlanc of Michelin has this to say about first contract arbitration, "We do not want any third party, who knows nothing about our business, deciding our employment terms and conditions. And risks subjecting us to costs that we cannot afford. That would leave us with very few options." And I will table that document as well.</p>
<p>Mr. LeBlanc went on to say, "It makes my job and other people's job very difficult to sell Nova Scotia as a better place to invest than many of the other sites Michelin has around the world."</p>
<p>Clearwater President Colin MacDonald could not understand why the government introduced the legislation in the first place, saying, "There are other issues the government needs to deal with without riling up the business community" I will table that document as well, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Egg Studios, which I am sure many of you are familiar with in this area, were the unfortunate guinea pigs for first contract arbitration. The contract imposed on Egg would drive up wages and benefits by 25 to 30 per cent and threatens the business's future in the province. I will table that document as well.</p>
<p>Basically first contract arbitration kills jobs. Let's face it, it's a bad policy. This bill tinkers with a bad policy. To take a bad policy and water it down doesn't make it a good policy. Anything that risks jobs is not a risk worth taking. After all, Nova Scotia has 2,400 fewer jobs and 2,600 fewer people in the labour force than this time last year.</p>
<p>Now is the time to concentrate on creating jobs; it is not the time to be fiddling with job-killing legislation. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Cape Breton Centre.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I suppose I do agree with the previous speaker, it is fiddling, but in it from a whole different perspective. I guess for the record, too, the issue around Egg Films is one about the issues of who's in and who's out of the union. It's not an issue of first contract, for the record, so let's get that straight.</p>
<p>In first contract, the reality is that in order to even get there you have to pass that bar of getting certified. Now I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this province - and I have had the privilege of organizing trade unions in this province and outside this province through provincial legislation and federal legislation. Without fear of being told differently, I would say that Nova Scotia ranks in the top two or three hardest provinces to organize in, because of the tests you have to meet. You have to see first contract legislation through that lens. The lens is that you've passed this huge hurdle, and now you've got to get to the table and get an agreement.</p>
<p>The idea that first contract is a job killer, as portrayed by some, is just not so. Like I said, you have to get that very hard test, that very difficult test to get to even start collective bargaining, because there's no such thing as card check in this province. There's no automatic certification. It's a very, very difficult province in which to organize.</p>
<p>It has been a tactic, if you will, by people at the table to elongate collective bargaining, and part of that is, as they would say, to run out the clock. That has been used many times in this province.</p>
<p>I would submit to you that the need of this legislation today is because - and we were told businesses would flee and so on, and that hasn't happened, so I really don't understand the need for this legislation. The real issue here will be that the bill, in basic terms, says that a contract will be imposed after bad-faith bargaining, because that's basically what it does.</p>
<p>Again, I'll rely on my years of experience previous to this House and say, in this province, if there's an issue of organizing as difficult, then it's 10 times harder to prove bad-faith bargaining. It's a very difficult bar. You have to go - the employer, or the bargaining unit, the person, the group representing the bargaining units - and you have to find hard facts that they did something purposely to impede getting a collective agreement, and did it for less than honest reasons, which is a very, very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>I would think the Progressive Conservative Party should actually be fairly happy with this bill, because with the way this is written, it will basically do away with first contract in this province. That is a shame, because I think the women and men who have asked for certification and met that test will be denied this useful tool in their toolbox. By the fact that an employer was used erroneously in trying to prove that this was the reason, this was the harm being done to an employer, that it was first contract and it wasn't, tells me that's the lack of understanding that Party has when it comes to collective bargaining.</p>
<p>It's an emotional issue right across this province. We can go back to the days of the Michelin bill, go back to all those things. To portray collective bargaining in this province as a walk in the park, so to speak, is truly inaccurate. It's something you see time and time again. You see where certifications will fall by the wayside because there's no avenue open to either party to try to accelerate this. Because what first contract would do, and does do: it allows that period of time for both parties to work under a collective agreement and get to see how the system works and, you know, how they can get along.</p>
<p>I mean the reality is that it gives you the mechanism for a first contract, first, but it doesn't give you any mechanism for a second. So, I mean, if the two parties cannot get to a meaningful resolution of collective bargaining, then there are those other issues that take place as approved by the Trade Union Act. In most cases that would be the ability for a strike or a lockout, Mr. Speaker. So you have those issues and, you know, that's a hammer that people really do not want to use.</p>
<p>I often hear when people talk about the trade union movement and they say, oh, strikes - but again, there's an old adage that it's much easier to get people on the picket line than to get them off the picket line. That's the reality of it. Once out there, you're negotiating with a clock ticking and the one is, do the employees who are affected, do they leave and seek employment elsewhere, does the strike itself cause harm to the employer and cause such an economic issue that they move on themselves?</p>
<p>So, you know, people are cognizant of that on both sides. Most reasonable people, or, I guess, by definition reasonable people - not just most but reasonable people - see that. They see that we have to justify this. We do not want to withdraw our services and the employer says, look, we really don't want to lock our doors. But in the odd case, there are times, a first contract, where both parties are finding their way. This would allow for a much larger and better cooling off period. The cooling off period would actually be a time, Mr. Speaker, when they would work together and find out how this goes.</p>
<p>Most collective agreements, especially the first ones, it's a framework and then it's built on. You would have, in essence, what people would refer to as mature agreements, that probably have been collectively bargained say five to 10 times. After you get that going, usually it's just shaping a few things, maybe adding or taking a step out of the grievance process, or obviously one that's always ever-present for most people would be wages. But the mature agreements, we'd really maybe talk in terms of benefits. Just Friday we sent a bill over to the Law Amendments Committee on a statutory holiday, a holiday type. How is a holiday paid for? Do you negotiate double time? How do you do that if it's your day off and you're called out on that statutory holiday? What should be your reimbursement for that? So they're the ones that I would say fall under the category of a mature agreement, and employers and so on are used to working with that.</p>
<p>Now, first contract is kind of a new venture for both parties, by and large, Mr. Speaker. Some of them can be like a larger company that has a subsidiary that they may be organizing and they have a human resource department that would handle some of the collective bargaining for them. So these things aren't new, but for those that are, these are issues that from time to time, depending on the size of the employer or the size of the union itself, what they would do. They may bring in someone to help them collectively bargain and that person may be a member of the Bar, or it may be somebody else who has been associated with collective bargaining and have put up their shingle, so to speak.</p>
<p>A lot of times it is to find a way to get people to understand - can we work together in a collective bargaining process with a collective agreement in effect? That's what I believe first contract does. I believe these amendments will erode that and make it very much a toothless tiger. I believe that the way it sits today, it works, it works well and therefore our Party will not be supporting this bill going forward. Thank you.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#2c8e1a56-2f9d-4156-a91f-77802701e3d3"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Okay, so finally, those are some of the indicators and some of the pressures we have as a fragile economy, and it does seem like a perfect storm. But I think there are also opportunities, Madam Speaker, and I'll quickly, in the time that I have remaining, talk about some of those. The port development in Sydney, and the harbour dredge that was supported by all three levels of government, I think, was an opener for that opportunity. My fellow MLAs from the PC Party were at the Port Summit, and I tell you, it's a complicated file, no question, and the more you peel off the layers, the more complicated it gets. But having said that, I think there are tremendous opportunities with the port, and there are private sector suitors. When the global shipping sector recovers, as we all hope and pray that it will, then I think that Sydney Port becomes very viable, and that's an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Donkin mine, of course, the reality is you make strides to curb greenhouse gas emissions and apply renewable energies to your energy grid, but at the end of the day the world is still going to need coal, and there are buyers for the coal that Donkin could potentially produce, and when Xstrata finds a suitable-sized buyer for that, that mine will be in play. So I think we look forward to that, and that looks like probably in the vicinity of 1,000 jobs total with spinoff.</p>
<p>Also the tourism sector, without question, when the northeastern U.S. economy rebounds and people start to spend money on tourism and travel again, you've got to think that Nova Scotia and Cape Breton are destinations. With Louisbourg300 coming next year, that's going to be an incredibly historic celebration on the Island, and I would hope that thousands and thousands of Nova Scotians who have never experienced Louisbourg - for that matter, thousands of Cape Bretoners who have never experienced Louisbourg - get out to take that in.</p>
<p>And of course, something that's very important to us, and we've been learning about it in recent weeks, the CBRM capital plan that's been put forth by the mayor and council. I really think, put the politics aside, I think this plan is something that we could take a look at. When you look at those infrastructure requirements, and it's not unique to the CBRM, all municipalities have those pressures. So when you look at what those pressures are, when you put together a comprehensive plan, which is one that's very unique to the Island, I think it could be used as a template, because it provides, basically, 25 cent dollars for the provincial government, whoever that provincial government is. When you have a municipality that's kicking in $15 million a year, when you're going to the feds to look for $150 million - half of that $300 million - then I think that it is incumbent on the province to jump in there.</p>
<p>Given those unemployment numbers that we've seen, and what that looks like, I think it is - if we have those long-term prospects of growth, and I mentioned some of those, then this could be almost a bridge to get some people working, keep the tradespeople on the ground in Cape Breton, as opposed to travelling back and forth to Fort Mac, and keep things going. This will require a bit of innovative thinking, I think, in terms of the province and the provincial government, but this is a real plan, and it's therefore, I think, a template for municipalities, and it's not going to hurt us.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, government can't save industries and they can't run the economy by themselves, that's not our job, that's not the government's job. The job is to set the environment and get out of the way and I think if we take some of these steps and make sure that entrepreneurs are supported, municipalities are supported, we'll get there. And with that I'll take my place. Thank you.</p></speech>

I think the question we are all asking, is this budget making life more affordable for Nova Scotians? I want to start out on a positive note. (Interruption) I do. I was looking at a press release, Madam Speaker, and I noticed that Heritage Gas is investing over $50 million to expand its pipeline into Pictou County and, of course, they're going to be delivering natural gas. I know, actually I think this sums it up and I will table this, this is a quote from Pat Lee, the CEO of the Pictou County Health Authority, "The delivery of natural gas to Pictou County is good for business &#x2026; Our business is health care and we are continually seeking efficiencies and ways to save money. Natural gas will give us substantial annual savings, money that can be redirected to patient care."</p>
<p>I think all members in the Legislature would agree with the CEO of the Pictou County Health Authority on that point. We all know, and I know the Minister of Energy knows, that natural gas is affordable and it does reduce emissions. I'm not having anybody on the other side arguing with me, Madam Speaker, so obviously there's full agreement here. I know that the minister himself said that it will save millions of dollars in energy costs for large industrial employers with savings around the corner for small business, hospitals, schools and family homes.</p>
<p>We are in agreement. The member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville talks about emissions. Natural gas emissions are 50 per cent less than coal. He's asking about federal regulations, but this province will have no problem doing that. In fact, the federal government has relaxed those regulations recognizing that we also have to take into account the economy and we look at businesses - I think about Michelin, they have natural gas now, and why do they want natural gas? Because it's cheaper.</p>
<p>I can think of another company in the province, I won't mention their name, but they actually produce renewable energy. Do they use it for their business? No, they don't, but they sell it to the grid so that we can all purchase it through Nova Scotia Power, but what do they use? They use natural gas. That's about as much proof as you will ever need.</p>
<p>The reason I'm beginning my discussion, I think we have agreement here, that natural gas is a good thing. I should table that release because it is right from the government, we are in agreement. It's time that we have more agreement in this Legislature. I encourage them to continue using more natural gas because it does pollute less and it's affordable, which is a lot more than we can say for some of the other options they've been choosing.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about somebody I spoke with yesterday evening in my constituency and she was asking me about her power bill. The first thing I said to her, why don't we check with Nova Scotia Power and see if maybe there was an error made in reading your meter. I know myself, one time they made an error reading the meter by 1,000 kilowatt hours and I got a surprise when I saw my bill. She got a surprise too, so we were able to get it corrected in my case, we're investigating it for her.</p>
<p>I also told her that the reason the power rates are going up is because this government, instead of choosing more natural gas, which I've just given them credit for in the release, which they are doing to some degree, instead of choosing to go more in that direction, they're choosing all these other expensive forms of energy and putting them into the mix. They always talk about it being stable, but the reason they say stable is because they know they can't say that it's cheaper.</p>
<p>I just want to tell the members opposite what the woman said to me, she left me with kind of a funny quote, she was certainly concerned about having to pay her power bill but throwing her hands up in the air, much as we do on this side of the House, all we can do is bring these points to the Legislature. She said, you can hit your head on the rock or you can hit the rock to your head. I kind of got a kick out of that saying - more or less to say that there's really not much she can do about it; and, there's not, unless the government decides to choose to require Nova Scotia Power to use energy inputs that are cheaper per kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>I remember back in April 2010 - I will table this as well as I move into the budget. The reason I wanted to talk about power costs is because that's one of the big costs for all Nova Scotians. We need to make power more affordable for people and I also want to tie that in with the fact that we need a budget delivered from government that's more affordable.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I was thinking about this on Budget Day because in April 2010 - and I'm going to table this and I'll just quote a little bit from it. These are words that I used myself here in the Legislature and I've talked here about Nova Scotians having heard a lot, at that time, about how bad things were. In November 2009 we had the economic review panel tell Nova Scotia that the province was on the road to financial ruin and to reinforce this notion Mr. Steele travelled the province to proclaim the same in his Back to Balance tour.</p>
<p>Now at that time in 2010 we had the NDP proposing a four-year budget plan to save Nova Scotia. I guess what amuses me is I also say here that people have seen this approach before. We can look back to the Romanow Government in Saskatchewan in the early 1990s where they were doing the same thing and making things look bad. We heard so much about a structural deficit and poof it's gone, in just three years. It just amuses that what I said would happen has happened, so I'm going to table that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think about when I was looking at the budget, when it was tabled last week, as a former Finance Critic over here I took a quick perusal of the budget and I counted 10 items totalling about $125 million that were either past over-budgeted expenses, to make past budgets look bad and to also to provide an ability for this government to rein in those really false expenses, because they were never made. The other component of that $125 million was actually some tax increases. That's a significant amount of money and I want to point some of them out because I love presenting facts in the Legislature and attaching numbers to it because the numbers don't lie, especially when they are the government's own numbers.</p>
<p>The first one is the FTE account, the number of people working in the civil service. In each of the past three years we've seen roughly an expected requirement of needing 10,700 people working in the civil service and then at the end of the year, oops, we only needed about 10,000. So every year they did that - and that gave them an extra 700 FTEs, which if you look at salary, benefits and office space, equates to about $100,000 apiece. That's $70 million each year that this government had, an extra expenditure that they knew they weren't going to spend anyway.</p>
<p>That did two things. One, it helped them to justify a tax increase because it was making things look worse than it was, by $70 million, and two, it gave them a number at a future point in time, which happens to be this year, where they could rein in that so-called expense, which didn't really exist to begin with because if you can get by running government with 10,000 people last year, I'm sure you can get by with running it with 10,000 this year.</p>
<p>So the government this year - and if you look on Page 1.14 in the Supplementary Detail, on that page you will see that they made a change this year, Madam Speaker - they addressed about half of that 700 number. Of course, if you look at half of $70 million, there are about $35 million in supposed savings. The truth of the matter is it was never an expense to begin with.</p>
<p>Another item here that I saw was Nova Scotia Business Inc. They were budgeted an extra $5 million last year that they never spent anyway, so this year they didn't budget it. Well, if they didn't need it last year, why would they need it this year? It's not really a budget saving but it was, once again, another example of the government over-budgeting expenses in the past, which they knew they weren't going to spend, to make the budget look worse. That can be found on Page 18.2 in the Supplementary Detail, and I encourage the members to write those page numbers down so they can have a look at these items and not just take the word of their Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>So Madam Speaker, there are two examples and I know I don't have a lot of time today so I think I'll save some of the other examples for another point in time, but suffice it to say 10 items totalling $125 million.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I just mentioned the Minister of Finance; I heard her in Port Hawkesbury not so long ago, in a pre-budget consultation, talking about how their government had a revenue problem, this despite taking an extra $1,000 out of the pockets of every Nova Scotian since they've increased the HST over the past three years, so it's an extra $300 million to $400 million a year in the coffers of government, but the minister still feels that she has a revenue problem.</p>
<p>One of the points brought up was that the government no longer has the offshore royalties that Premier Hamm had when he balanced the budget. I have to make this correction - in 2002-03 when Premier Hamm delivered the first balanced budget in four years, what were the offshore royalties, Madam Speaker? Half of what they're projected to be this year. So he had half as many royalties to work with in royalty revenue, and that government still managed to balance the budget - and they also did it without that additional HST tax increase.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we need not be surprised because there are members on the government side of this Legislature right now who voted against that budget, so we need not be surprised that they voted against a budget that strove to balance - sorry, to vote against a budget delivered by a government that strove to balance the budget and not put pressure on Nova Scotians and their disposable income. I'm happy to make that point today.</p>
<p>I think that we did see a couple of things that I think are positive as far as the transportation budget being maintained. It's nice to see them continuing that tradition. They never talk about the good things of governments past, but I think that's one that both the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP share in that I know during the MacDonald time, when he was Premier, had a real focus on the transportation budget and being from an area, an area that I actually now represent, where we have 2,300 kilometres of roads in Inverness County alone and knowing how important roads are to people in our area, I think that's a good thing. It's an important service that Nova Scotians expect for their tax dollar and I'm happy to see that that budget is maintained for transportation.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I noticed that the government is also spending a bit more this year on taxation and fiscal policy. I'm hoping that might yield some wisdom in terms of perhaps reducing the amount of debt that they have been adding to the provincial debt in the form of deficits each year. We've seen the government add over $1.67 billion in debt by the end of this budget year as they proposed with this budget. (Interruption)</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#bf8b9586-8d64-4f8f-b12a-88dfc38ac185"><from>MR. LLOYD HINES</from><p>I rise with a sense of honour and humble gratitude to stand in this historic place to address my honourable colleagues representing the residents of Nova Scotia's largest geographical riding, the new riding of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie. It is a privilege to serve with my fellow Liberal members, of course, but also with each and every member of this House, in particular the many I have known and worked together with during my time in municipal government. And particular congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment, the wisdom of which you are displaying with great ability, evident in this sitting.</p>
<p>The road to this place is far from being a straight line and along the way there are many places where you need help. I want to briefly mention some of those who provided that help recently and over the years. I must start with my lovely wife of 37 years, Patricia, who has been my solid rock in all that we have accomplished together and without whose encouragement and indulgence I would not be standing before you today. Together we raised four children: Sarah, Shannon, Victoria, and our son Regan, who have shared in every up and down of my political career spanning 11 elections. They have always been there believing in what I have been attempting to accomplish, thank you very much my wonderful family.</p>
<p>Of course, I must mention the super group of believing individuals who are my campaign team. Faced with a new riding, which is vast, we had to build and rebuild networks in areas new to all, but the energetic people who came to my side made it happen. Close to 100 people came to work on our team and each one shares in our victory. People like Shirley, Dan, Bruce, Monica, Shelley, Ed, Cheryll, Milt, Moira and countless others including the granddaughter of my great friend and great Nova Scotian, a man familiar to this House, the late A.M. (Sandy) Cameron. I will be eternally grateful to you all. Thanks to all in the provincial campaign who worked flawlessly to answer every question with an inspiring calmness, thorough knowledge, and instant responsiveness. For a busy candidate, such support is priceless.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign our team kept up constant contact with our neighbouring ridings, and I wish to thank those members for the common vision and co-operation throughout the writ period. One last tip of the hat to my former council colleagues and staff at the Municipality of the District of Guysborough, many of whom were with me for 25 years, for all the ambient support in your manners and good wishes - it means a lot. The bonus for you is that you're rid of me once and for all from your council table.</p>
<p>I should mention, Mr. Speaker, that since the election they were able to have a by-election, elect a new councillor to replace me and elect a new warden for the municipality - so, so much for being indispensable.</p>
<p>And, finally, thank you to our Premier, who accepted my candidacy for a second time and provided constant support throughout the run - it is a great honour to serve in a government led by this man.</p>
<p>Now I want to take you on a short journey through the beautiful and diverse riding of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie. Beginning on the northern shore of our great province, on St. Georges Bay in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the venerable Port of East Tracadie, from whose wharf our fishermen still ply their ancient trade, around Cape Jack past Havre Boucher, along the Strait of Canso to one of Canada's most prominent, man-made features, the Canso Causeway.</p>
<p>When this construction marvel was completed in 1955, an incredible benefit aside from the ease of access to and from Cape Breton was created. Prior to that time the annual drift ice from the Gulf blocked the Strait of Canso for extended periods, making the deepest port on the East Coast of North America unusable for several months of the year and severely limiting its utility. The new causeway acted as a dam against the ice and has opened up this port for use year-round, which has seen significant industry migrate to the Strait bringing jobs and good economy to the region.</p>
<p>The Strait continues to be recognized for its potential, with an international container terminal under development for Melford in Guysborough Municipality. East Asian interests are in the area scouting for liquefied natural gas sites, and other exciting business opportunities are in the hopper. Wind turbines are now turning on both sides of the Strait, a testament to the many natural advantages the region holds.</p>
<p>Next door to the Causeway lies the beautiful port Town of Mulgrave, long celebrated as the ferry access to Cape Breton and a prolific fishing area. Strategically located close to proposed developments and hosting an international nutraceutical company, Royal DSM, Mulgrave lies poised for growth. Continuing southeast past Steep Creek and Sand Point, we move past a point at Red Head and pass into Chedabucto Bay on the Atlantic, one of the largest bays on Canada's East Coast.</p>
<p>Continuing along the coast, past the sandy beaches of Clam Harbour and Hadley Beach, we reach the sheltered port of Guysborough, the shire town of the Municipality of the District of Guysborough and a bustling community in its own right. Home to the Mulgrave Road Theatre and Chedabucto Place Performance Centre, it has a lively cultural community and tireless volunteers.</p>
<p>Together with a good presence of government services, entrepreneurial efforts abound. The Days Gone By Bakery and restaurant just celebrated 15 years of successful service, and local businesses work hard to provide service to the many surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Recently, Authentic Seacoast has expanded its beer brewing business - it is now listed in the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission - opened a superb coffee roaster and is busy planning a craft distillery for a Spring of 2014 construction, providing badly needed jobs to a rural community.</p>
<p>Near the shire town we find three of Nova Scotia's largest African Nova Scotian communities: Sunnyville, Lincolnville, and Upper Big Tracadie. These residents, whose ancestors date back over 250 years, display their proud traditions with such facilities as the African Canadian Heritage and Friendship Centre, housed in the local school, and an annual festival celebrating their proud heritage. These communities are particularly proud of their African Nova Scotian council representative, Councillor Sheila Pelly, district councillor, for the solid representation that she delivers.</p>
<p>Heading east on Route 16 we pass through the historic community of Queensport, with its iconic island lighthouse; through Hazel Hill, the first Canadian home of Western Union's transatlantic cable site; and enter the oldest fishing area in North America, the historic and proud community of Canso. Home to National Historic Site Grassy Island, which was the staging area for the British Siege of Louisbourg, Mr. Speaker, Canso is now an important renewable energy site with the soon-to-be-turning turbines of the Sable wind farm - to say nothing of the incredible fishing industry currently leading the pack with the development of Nova Scotia's only trapped shrimp fishery.</p>
<p>Around Glasgow Head is tucked the vibrant community of Little Dover, home to several dozen lobster licences that drive the economy, and around the bay to Whitehead and into Tor Bay where Captain Savalet entertained Samuel de Champlain in 1608 - Savalet, who at that point said he had been coming to that bay for many years, harvested the rich waters for fish, which he transported back to France.</p>
<p>La communaut&#xE9; prochaine est la belle ville de Rivi&#xE8;re-de-Larry, maison &#xE0; la Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; des Acadiens de la r&#xE9;gion de Tor Baie. Nous sommes tr&#xE8;s enchant&#xE9;s de cette communaut&#xE9; acadienne, qui ouvre maintenant un nouveau mus&#xE9;e, la Salle des Acadiens.</p>
<p>Along the coast, through many more historic communities, too numerous to name, takes us to Goldboro, named originally for the great Nova Scotia gold play of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and now the host community to the first offshore natural gas development in this country, Mr. Speaker. Now hosting a second gas project in Canada's Deep Panuke; first gas from those reservoirs is expected to be announced any day. Further still, host to an active application to locate eastern Canada's first liquefied natural gas export terminal at that port - Goldboro: truly Nova Scotia's energy hub.</p>
<p>Moving west through the deep fjord known as Country Harbour, we reach Stormont, sporting the landing spot for Mersey Seafoods' Greenland shrimp fishery. That's a huge fishery, Mr. Speaker, employing many, many people in the area. Further west, we travel across the ferry to Port Bickerton, with its very active Lighthouse Association, to the shire town of the Municipality of the District of St. Mary's, historic Sherbrooke. Here sits the Nova Scotia Museum's Historic Sherbrooke Village, a living museum of world renown. I would truly invite members to take a relaxing ride and visit Nova Scotia's Liscombe Lodge in nearby Liscombe and try their famous planked salmon.</p>
<p>Continuing along Highway No. 7, we pass through seaside Marie Joseph to Ecum Secum, marking the border into municipality number five that comprises the Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie riding, Halifax Regional Municipality. Onward through Necum Teuch, Moser River, the Quoddys, Port Dufferin - home to the soon-to-be-producing gold mine at Dufferin Mines being developed by Ressources Appalaches.</p>
<p>And now, we enter into the outskirts of the anchor community of eastern Halifax Regional Municipality, Sheet Harbour. Sheet Harbour is a busy and bustling community serving a large catchment area. It serves as the business centre and service centre for the large region. An extremely active and effective board of trade led by the business community provides yeomen service for the area. Long a great renewable energy centre harnessing the hydro power from the East and West Rivers as they flow into the Atlantic, the area remains an important contributor to the provincial power grid. Centre for an active arts community and host to one of the province's best ports, Sheet Harbour Port, the future is bright for this great area.</p>
<p>Pushing still westward, Mr. Speaker, we pass through the lovely tourist areas of Spry Bay, Mushaboom, Tangier, and Murphy Cove, arriving at the western-most boundary of this magnificent riding at East Ship Harbour at Newcombe Brook, and the beginning boundary of the riding represented by our Speaker. So there you have it: a journey of over 500 kilometres, over 5,100 square kilometres, and home to approximately 10,500 electors.</p>
<p>Please grant me your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, to speak about our strong people and their economy. With almost 20 per cent of Nova Scotia's coast, it is therefore obvious that the importance of the fishery is paramount to our people. Inshore and offshore landings are significant, and over 300 lobster fishers under licence risk life and limb in the pursuit of Nova Scotia's sweetest crustaceans, found in these Eastern Shore pristine waters. No debate on that - good. Indeed, this fishery represents our last bastion against out-migration, with young men and women staying in their home communities to continue the family tradition of fishing, blessing our schools with their children, and being economic generators in their respective communities.</p>
<p>Then there is the forestry. Centuries of stewardship of our forests by our predecessors gifted us with viable forests which, with careful husbandry, will continue to be productive for future generations.</p>
<p>Farming is an important vocation in the riding, with dairy, beef, huge blueberry production, and thousands of acres of balsam fir Christmas tree production that has supplemented incomes for decades. All these activities have helped create an incredible tourist product throughout the riding, as the natural advantages of great rivers and intriguing coastal areas catch the traveller's imagination and bring visitors to our communities for experiential tourism.</p>
<p>These are the traditional industries in the riding, but let's turn our attention to the future. Starting with energy, the Sable Offshore Energy Project has been heating homes and businesses throughout Atlantic Canada since 2000. A second billion-dollar offshore investment has landed on the riding's shores at Goldboro, with the Encana Deep Panuke gas project. It's nearing first gas and, together with the Sable project, will put millions more dollars into the royalty coffers of the province. Because Goldboro is the beginning point of the Maritimes &amp; Northeast transmission pipeline, that piece of infrastructure has attracted investors who plan to establish Eastern Canada's first liquefied natural gas export terminal.</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#de2082f3-cf3a-4955-8a4e-4f1bf0ac1301"><from>MR. MAT WHYNOTT</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I'm glad to rise and talk for a few minutes in regard to some issues that are important to our Party and our government, as well as many Nova Scotians and particularly the constituents that I have the pleasure of representing and have represented over the last almost four years now.</p>
<p>I think it's important that part of a debate is always the other side of the story, Madam Speaker, taking the opportunity to go back in time to talk about some of the decisions that were made in the past. One of the things - I've a few topics that I think, I know I would love to speak for more than 15 minutes, but I have only about 15 minutes, but I want to discuss some issues that are important to Nova Scotians and moving Nova Scotia forward, but let's talk about some of the past.</p>
<p>One of the things that we know is that health care has always been a very important issue to Nova Scotians: health care, having access to medical professionals; access meaning not waiting a long period of time to see a health care professional. One of the things that other governments, the Parties opposite have always said - what they would do is they would just kind of throw money at an issue and hopefully it would go away. With regard to emergency room closures, this is an issue that we heard several times and our Party has been the lead on health care initiatives in this province and in this country, quite frankly.</p>
<p>Health care is an important issue to Nova Scotians and one of the things we've been trying to do over the past number of years is ensuring that we use the money that we have, the resources that we have, in an innovative way. In particular, around using Collaborative Emergency Centres that give people same-day or next-day appointments to medical professionals. In fact, what we're seeing is that Nova Scotians are finally seeing open emergency care in their community when and where they need it.</p>
<p>When you look at some of the facilities that have switched over to the CEC model, they have virtually seen no closures in their emergency rooms because they are able to see the health care professionals in their own communities. It took 20 years - 20 years we had ER closures under the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives, they just let it continue. In fact, the Liberal Party closed 1,500 hospital beds and said, that will fix the issue. Well, I don't think so.</p>
<p>The other thing they did was they paid nurses to leave the province, over 1,000 nurses. They paid them to leave our province. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the Liberal Party built a hospital right here in downtown Halifax, closing one full hospital, merging two hospitals into one and not making it large enough - an ER that was broken, and I will give kudos to the former Progressive Conservative Government who did see the foresight in expanding that ER because it was underbuilt. It wasn't built for the capacity in which we knew it was needed.</p>
<p>The Liberals are stuck in the past. The Liberals want to go back to the way it used to be. Let's just throw money at things, let's just throw money at problems, let's throw money at health care initiatives, let's just throw money at it. We can't do it, that's just not the way to do it, that's not the way to move Nova Scotia forward. In health care, what the Liberals want to do is create one super board so that decisions in health care are made out of Halifax and not made out of Liverpool, not made out of Kentville, not made out of Yarmouth, not made out of Amherst, not made out of Truro, not made out of New Glasgow, not made out of Port Hawkesbury, not made out of Sydney. They want the decisions of the Liberal Party, they want to have a super board.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that when they create super boards like they did in Alberta (Interruptions) like they have in New Brunswick, it doesn't work. This government has moved administrative costs away from the boardroom and at front-line care. That's what Nova Scotians want. They don't want rollbacks of collective agreements. They don't want that. That's what the Liberal Party would do and I would be remiss to suggest - would the Liberal Party bring forward P3 hospitals like they did with the schools? I bet they would. I don't hear them chirping on over there that they wouldn't, so I guess they would.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to talk about is fiscal responsibility. In the 2009 provincial campaign, we knew as a Party that we can't just promise 34 pages of promises. That is what the Liberal Party did, but we can't do that, because we knew the fiscal restraints that government was under because of the worldwide recession - one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Fiscal responsibility is an important piece of the puzzle here, because this NDP Government is one of only three governments in the country to bring forward a balanced budget. This is an important thing to point out. Something to point out is the fact that the last time a Liberal Government balanced a budget in this province was 1976. I know that the member for Yarmouth would say, well, that's in the past. Well, you're right, it is in the past. The Liberal Party has a record to stand on, because when they were government there was chaos in our system. There was chaos in our health care system, there was chaos in our education system, and there was chaos in social services. People on income assistance were not getting the help that they needed.</p>
<p>Do you know how much the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia promised in the last election when it came to promises? I have an article from The ChronicleHerald here that I want to table. It was dated May 23, 2009, and the title of the article is "LIBERAL PLATFORM; So, whose dog ate page 34?" One of the things that needs to be pointed out in this whole debate - and I know the Liberal Party says they wouldn't have raised taxes, they wouldn't have been able to bring in - and they said they would so-called "innovate" in how we run our programs.</p>
<p>But one of the things that the Liberal Party never says is how they would have paid for the $527.75 million worth of promises. That's half a billion dollars that the Liberal Party said that they would do, said that they would bring forward if they had their way. The question is, how would they have paid for it? So either they are going to make promises and not keep them - and then they say they're not going to raise taxes and then probably raise taxes. That's the important piece of this puzzle: over half a billion dollars in promises that the Liberal Party said that they would bring forward in the last election, and how would the Liberal Party have paid for it? I'll table that.</p>
<p>What time do I have until, Madam Speaker?</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>Mr. Speaker</from><p>Some facts about this project, : send-out capacity up to 10 million tons per year; capital expenditures, $5 billion to $10 billion Canadian. Yes, I did say "billion". Up to 3,500 workers for 36 to 42 months, to build the facility; 200 direct jobs in the operating state; and countless spinoff opportunities for small business. This project is now before the Nova Scotia Department of Environment for environmental assessment, and recently an application was prepared for the National Energy Board for an import-export permit for that project.</p>
<p>On the renewable side, COMFIT turbines are producing income for residents, and a 13.8 megawatt wind farm is under construction near Hazel Hill and Canso.</p>
<p>The mining sector is very important to the riding, with a renewed gold mine scheduled for operation in early 2014, which will employ 78 people at Dufferin Mines in the Sheet Harbour region. Martin Marietta operates eastern Canada's largest aggregate mine at Cape Porcupine near Auld's Cove, employing just shy of 100 people. A second aggregate export development is in the advanced planning stages on tidewater, just 11 kilometres from the community of Canso, with a projected workforce of 80 and a capital cost approaching $100 million.</p>
<p>Another prolific gold deposit at Goldboro is being proven up, and Orex Corporation, a gold developer, is preparing to file a permit for a 10,000-ton bulk sample which will confirm the future mine's viability.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, on the Strait of Canso at Melford, we have a well-advanced proposal for an international container terminal, and that wonderful, ice-free, deep-water port that I mentioned was made possible by the advent of the Canso Causeway. The capital projection for that project was $400 million and 200 jobs in the operating phase, and we in rural Nova Scotia need those jobs to build the economy back for this province.</p>
<p>Woven throughout the economy of the riding is the ever-present tourism industry along the shore from East Ship Harbour, through to Sherbrooke, through to Canso with its famous Stan Rogers Festival, which I invite everyone in the House to take in. It's a marvellous activity. Along the shore to East Tracadie lies some of Canada's most scenic geography. Unique tourist businesses have their shingles out - showing strong spirit to entertain the incredulous visitors who are enchanted by the spectacular beauty. Authentic Seacoast at Guysborough is one of those businesses that is making a significant mark with its various offerings, including a coffee roaster - served here recently in the House, Mr. Speaker, their coffee - an Internet caf&#xE9; and trading company featuring decadent pastries created onsite, a craft brewery, and soon to be joined by a craft distillery - all of which contribute to more jobs for our important rural economy.</p>
<p>I look forward with vigour and excitement to representing the wonderful people of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie in this historic Assembly. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>One of the things that this government knows we are doing is putting the investments where they need to be - investments in communities right across the province. I know I hear a member from Cape Breton talking about jobs. I think that's an important piece of the puzzle, and one of the things they're saying is that that Party, the PC Party and the Liberal Party, would not have helped Port Hawkesbury Paper succeed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention that I'm grateful for the privilege to work in this House with the representatives on all sides of the House who have all demonstrated in one way or another their ability to encourage their constituents, who have a great deal of knowledge and experience in their respective former careers, and the abilities which I believe have the potential to contribute to the improvement of our province as a whole.</p>
<p>I also just wanted to take a quick moment, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a point to recognize the member for Pictou West for inspiring such an impressive voter turnout in her riding. I think that we should recognize that as the House. (Applause) I hope that we can all continue to inspire Nova Scotians and get some more people out to the polls next time around.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to be a part of this House of Assembly, filled with former lawyers, first responders, farmers, educators, municipal representatives, entrepreneurs, as well as the former members of the House and more. I am additionally grateful that we're accompanied by the member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley and the member to my left, the member for Sackville-Beaver Bank. Honestly, gentlemen, pray for us.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians deserve nothing except our best and I look forward to our collective contributions to change. I hope that we can move toward enhancing this province, modernizing this Legislature, achieving the best possible results for our province through constructive debate, and restoring the faith of a declining voting population.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to share a few interesting points with regard to my community and pieces that contribute to why I'm very proud to be the representative for Hammonds Plains-Lucasville. Upper Hammonds Plains is home to Pockwock Lake, perhaps more commonly known as the Pockwock Watershed where HRM gets its drinking water. Hammonds Plains is home to the Wallace Hills Indian Reserve - historically a stopping place for the Mi'kmaq First Nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Upper Hammonds Plains Volunteer Fire Department, originally opened by 48 volunteers in 1966, was officially established in 1970 - therefore making Upper Hammonds Plains the home to the first all-Black fire department in Canada. Upper Hammonds Plains is additionally the home of now retired Lieutenant Gina Jones-Wilson who was the first female African Canadian to achieve a Level 1 firefighting certification in our province and continues to be an activist within our community.</p>
<p>The Upper Hammonds Plains Volunteer Fire Department was made possible by the efforts of the local community. The Ladies Auxiliary from Emmanuel Baptist Church contributed to the fundraising efforts and the land for the fire hall was donated by community resident Mrs. Elizabeth Mantley. Elizabeth's daughter, Doreen Mantley, still lives in Upper Hammonds Plains, is a fantastic person and an incredible cook - though I will state for the record that my mom still holds the title.</p>
<p>Speaking of Emmanuel Baptist Church - or EBC: The MEETing Place - it celebrates the rich legacy of its founding members, three Black refugees of the War of 1812 who first settled in Upper Hammonds Plains. This place of celebration is truly a central point in our community and beyond. People come from far and wide to be part of this experience and whether you are deeply religious or not, the people who make up the congregation at Emmanuel - led by Pastor Lennett Anderson - are the most welcoming group I have ever met. I encourage everyone in this House, and anywhere, to make a point to attend a service as our Premier did the first Sunday of the election.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I need to give a sincere thank you to the congregation at EBC, for Sundays were an opportunity to reflect, relax, and recharge during the months leading up to and throughout the campaign. The strength that carried me because of my participation at Emmanuel was integral to the success of my campaign. I'm happy to say that such a powerful place, filled with incredible people, is in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville just up the road, and I look forward to continue being a part of the celebration. Again, these are only a few significant pieces of my community's history and I look forward to the opportunity to learn more.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I represent a newly-formed riding. The redistribution of the provincial boundaries formed Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, a riding that incorporates, more exclusively, the place that I've called home. This was a major contribution to why I decided to put my name forward. I have great confidence speaking on our behalf and I'm committed to doing so. I grew up in HPL playing competitive sports, for example, for TASA Minor Hockey, Halifax County United Soccer, Hammonds Plains Soccer as well as playing for the Bay Ducks organization in the Maritime Junior League. I want to thank the people who continue to make these organizations successful and enable opportunities for wellness through sport in our community.</p>
<p>Hammonds Plains-Lucasville is a community that is home to more than 10 extended families of mine, which is extremely inspirational. I'm privileged to be connected to so many wonderful people throughout my riding, for example through church, sport, school, family, and various community groups. The election campaign was a great opportunity to meet new people, reconnect with people I hadn't seen for quite some time, and hear their collective testimonial, which supported a lot of what I understood about the area.</p>
<p>Our community is the site for many small businesses and hardworking entrepreneurs. It is additionally a thoroughfare to the Lighthouse Route and the beautiful South Shore region of the province, though I will add, a thoroughfare, whether the road can handle it or not, is just a shortcut. The area is comprised mainly of, but not limited to, young families and senior citizens. It is evident, based on our demographics, that this is a community where parents are eager to raise their family and senior citizens, many of whom have raised their families in the community, intend to spend their retirement.</p>
<p>I am confident in my understanding of our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and our challenges. I look forward to expressing them in this Chamber, throughout this mandate, and working hard to ensure that we maximize our opportunities in HPL.</p>
<p>Before I delve into the concerns of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, I need to take a moment to recognize some of the people who contributed their time, talents and treasure, helping me put together my campaign, a successful campaign. Bill Crawley was my campaign manager; Darrell Jessome was my official agent - Darrell is also my father and a former colleague of the member for Pictou East; Ben MacDonald, assistant to the official agent; Jillian MacDonald, Ben's sister, was the candidate scheduler; Ariel Gough was our social media and Web site chair; Matthew Heffler was our written communications; Rob MacLaughlin was our sign chair; Terry Bent, Kathy Baker and Clark Swim were our office managers; Cameron Stoddard was our volunteer coordinator; John Jessome, my brother, and Callie Butler were fundraising co-chairs; Erik Mistal; our get-out-the-vote coordinator; Joseph Landry and Brian Gazeley, our election night coordinators; Peter Covert; my mother Pam; and my two other brothers, Nicholas and Matthew.</p>
<p>Frankly, there are a number of individuals who I could continue to address but I just felt compelled to mention these people in particular, where a group that didn't have the most experience in the world but we all had various abilities, which really contributed to a fantastic team. I hope everybody will stay committed, stay engaged and recognize that we can all add a lot of value to any room we go into. I look forward and hope they'll be around in four years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I mentioned the fact that I lived in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville for the majority of my life so I have a pretty firm understanding of the lay of the land. My canvassing efforts were certainly an emphasis on what I understand and I'm going to share some of the things that I heard at the doorsteps.</p>
<p>Firstly, our subdivisions have grown exponentially and continue to blossom in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville. Despite population declining in many places around the province, our community continues to explode with new residents. While I appreciate and understand the desire to move to our community, the scary fact is that the means of safe transportation has barely enhanced over time.</p>
<p>I won't complain about paving, other than on the Pockwock Road, but the Hammonds Plains and Lucasville Roads are a commuter's nightmare and a daily threat. There are presently 20,000-plus vehicles that travel on the two-lane Hammonds Plains Road daily. Mr. Speaker, the Hammonds Plains and Lucasville thoroughfares are of the utmost concern to residents. Having spent the majority of my life here, experiencing little change and reading through some of the testimonials of former representatives of this House of Assembly who have addressed the same concern, I wonder what it is going to take for someone to react and enable the upgrade that we need so desperately. The safety of our children waiting for the school bus and the safety of our hard-working Nova Scotians commuting to work to provide for their families, for example, is a perpetually escalating problem and needs to be addressed by the province, in conjunction with other municipal and federal partners.</p>
<p>Secondly, anxiety around the education system is major. For example, the size of classes, lacking resources for educators, support staff and administrators and the strains that are placed on these individuals and the students they teach are all genuine concerns that I hear door-to-door.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are so many who are more than capable and committed to enhancing the lives of the next generation through education but they need our help. We can do so much more, as a province, to ensure that young Nova Scotians maximize their potential in the classroom and evolve into the leaders of tomorrow. I am thrilled that there is so much emphasis in this room with regard to prioritizing education, restoring financial cuts and, in particular, updating the curriculum. Frankly, I'm hoping and willing to advocate for consideration for mandatory courses, especially at the secondary level, pertaining to current issues, economics and financial literacy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the state of the economy in Nova Scotia is of grave concern and the people of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville are no strangers to this reality. Businesses and residents in our community have concerns regarding our tax dollars, how much it costs for businesses to function and for an individual family to own and maintain a house.</p>
<p>There is also present concern for economic expansion in terms of job creation, which I realize is a problem recognized throughout the province and that there is much determination in this room to keep my generation, the next generation, and skilled workers in general, from migrating.</p>
<p>Health care is another huge concern for residents of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, in particular with regard to wait times, the pressure placed on front-line health care, and the means by which we provide long-term and end-of-life care for our seniors. Additionally, I'd like to emphasize the need for this House of Assembly to place emphasis on increasing our capacity for supporting Nova Scotians with various cognitive disabilities and mental illness. This includes, but isn't limited to, autistic youth trying to fit into classrooms and social circles; young adults feeling depressed and alone as they transition from adolescence into adulthood, in a world with seemingly insurmountable expectations; mothers and fathers who are feeling the weight of family pressures in ensuring their children have the best possible future; veterans returning from service after having faced the ultimate sacrifice to protect our rights and freedoms; and a senior population that is increasingly suffering from cases of dementia.</p>
<p>I won't ignore the recognition for its existence and the work that has been accomplished surrounding mental illness in the recent past. However, as someone who lost one of his best friends to depression, I really want to express this for the record. For many challenged with mental illness, negative public stigma is deathly isolating. Our collective inability to recognize someone in need is likely based on ignorance, but the more depression and suicide continue, the more we walk the line of insensitivity.</p>
<p>Our present ability to help individuals seek adequate support, individuals who need our listening ear and helping hand more than ever, is lacking - and for me, completely unacceptable. There is so much more we can contribute, and as a member of this government I ask everyone in this room to grab this beast by the horns so that our brothers and sisters can get the support they need to tame their demons.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm going to close very simply by thanking everyone who made it possible for me to be here today and say that I'm looking forward to being a part of the solution. I'm committed to working hard. I'm committed to doing my part, playing my role, and doing whatever it takes to be a good part of Team Nova Scotia and ensure our success. Thank you for the opportunity to submit my Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. Peace and God bless. (Applause)</p></speech>

        <speech by="#de2082f3-cf3a-4955-8a4e-4f1bf0ac1301"><from>MR. WHYNOTT</from><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. This question about jobs and ensuring that we are able to keep our young families here and, in fact, bring them home. On Sunday I was at church and I was speaking with a young man who is about 22 years old who is an engineer. He just graduated from engineering school in New Brunswick and he had the opportunity to move home. He came up to me and said, "Oh, it's good to see you." and I say, "Oh, well, you too, Brad, it's good to see you move home." And I said, "Well, where are you working?" and he said, "Well, this new company, they just moved to Nova Scotia, PROJEX. Have you heard of them?" I said, "Yes, in fact, I did." and I said, well, in fact, one of the reasons why PROJEX moved to Nova Scotia was because we want to bring Nova Scotians home, we're bringing an Alberta company to Nova Scotia to bring young people home.</p>
<p>One of the things I asked him, I said, "Brad, can you talk a little bit about the workforce at PROJEX?" So I asked the question, I said, "Well, how many people right now are currently working?' He says, "Oh probably 80, 85 right now because they're just continuing to hire." And I said, "So where are those people coming from?" He said about two-thirds of those people currently are expats. Mr. Speaker, they are people who lived in Ontario, they are people who lived in Saskatchewan, they are people who lived in Alberta and now they're able to come home.</p>
<p>So I said, "Who are these people, Brad?" He said, "They're younger people, they are people between the ages of 25 and 40, bringing their families home." Mr. Speaker, that is exactly why this government invested to help bring companies to Nova Scotia. That is exactly the type of story that this government has done to bring people home.</p>
<p>You know, Mr. Speaker, that's the type of inexperience that the Liberal Party has when it talks about jobs. I'll leave on this note, I had the opportunity of talking about the unemployment rate in the area of, I think it's Cape Breton-Canso, so in 2005 the unemployment rate for the federal constituency of Cape Breton-Canso - and I don't know quite, I believe it was Rodger Cuzner, the Liberal MP there - was 21.4 per cent and that was a Liberal Government of the day that forced jobs out of Cape Breton, I believe. They shut down some key industries in Cape Breton. Anyway, I just wanted to point that out about the Liberal Party here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we are talking about jobs, we are talking about bringing people home. The Liberal Party is stuck in the past about decisions. They just think that the old way is the good way. Nova Scotians in this Party know that's different.</p></speech>

          <p><b>SPEAKER'S RULING:</b> EECD Minister's refusal to answer certain questions during Question Period and CWH on Supply (Pt. of privilege by Hon. K. Casey [Hansard p. 529, 04/09/13]) No prima facie breach on privilege.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. Earlier today the honourable member for Colchester North rose on a point of privilege based on what she said was the refusal by the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development to answer certain questions during Question Period and the refusal by that minister to provide information to the Committee of the Whole House on Supply. The answers to both these points are simple but as one of them may affect proceedings later today and affect the member's ability to pursue the alleged breach of privilege, I want to deal with the matter now.</p>
<p>First, the refusal by a minister to answer a question during Question Period is not a breach of privilege. Second, without ruling on the merits of the member's claim of a breach of privilege in the Committee of the Whole House on Supply, the correct procedure is for her to raise it in the committee so that the committee can report it to the House for me to deal with. If the committee decides to issue such a report, there have been a number of rulings in recent years by the Chair that only in the rare cases of extreme and exceptional circumstances can the Speaker hear a point of privilege on a matter in a committee.</p>
<p>This is not such a case. It is entirely open to the member to raise her complaint in the Committee of the Whole for a decision on whether it wishes to report the matter to the House. I find there is no prima facie case of a breach of privilege.</p>
<p>The motion is carried.</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM.: USER FEES - INCREASES</heading>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I was actually expecting that you were going to read that for some reason, there was a pause, on what the subject was tonight for late debate, but the subject is user fees. It's my pleasure to rise tonight, I have just 10 minutes and that can barely scratch the surface of an issue as big as an increase in 1,400 user fees to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>When you look at that basket of fees, 1,400 covers so many different government services that it will touch every Nova Scotian to one degree or another. The last time the government did this was in 2011. The 1,400 fees went up 2 per cent each and that amounted to over $3 million that year, but that pales next to the increase that has been put in place this year, which is amounting to $11 million more in revenue. It is an increase of 5.8 per cent, almost 6 per cent, and that means a cumulative increase in the four years that the NDP have been in power, a cumulative increase of 8 per cent on the fees for every service that Nova Scotians rely on.</p>
<p>When I looked at the list and saw the large document that the Minister of Finance tabled here just before the long weekend, on the last business day of March, it was amazing to see how this is going to impact, in a negative way, business, individuals and the economy. Everything from food handling courses, which are what our waiting and food service people in restaurants have to take, to the fees we have to license an establishment; fees for recreation; things like culture and heritage, museums and historical sites, museum admission fees - all these things are going up. For business, salvage yard licences going up, environmental assessment fees rising, well-digging licences going higher; it just goes on and on. Some of them are really astounding, to see that we would touch those fees at all.</p>
<p>I know the government suggested there were a few fees they thought were sacred and they didn't go to, but 1,400 fees have gone up. In both instances, 2011 and this year, the fees were raised on the eve of a long weekend, both times, slipping it through as if to cause no - maybe to get as little attention as possible. I will say, this year, after the great debate last time in 2011 about how this was done in a stealth-like manner, in a manner that wasn't transparent and open, the government did table the increases here in the session of the Legislature. We do think that is certainly an improvement, at least it was above-board; at least it told us and the public exactly what was going up and the individual fee increases were included in that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our main concern here is that the government, when they were in Opposition, the NDP as Opposition members raised Cain about government increasing fees without justifying the fact that they were really cost recovery. The whole difference between a fee and a tax increase is that a fee is supposed to cover the cost of providing the service. A tax increase is clearly revenue generating. It's a way to put more money in the coffers of government to provide other services.</p>
<p>The NDP, when they were in Opposition, insisted that the government must justify these fee increases, but since taking office and becoming the Government of Nova Scotia, the NDP have not given us one shred of evidence that the increases that have come forward are actually doing what they previously wanted, and that is to show us that it really isn't a tax grab, that it is actually covering the cost of delivering the service.</p>
<p>It's very hard to imagine that it would cost 6 per cent more for somebody to issue a licence if you come in person to the Motor Vehicles office, or to get a marriage licence, a death certificate, a birth certificate. All of these costs have gone up 5.8 per cent in the latest round of fee increases.</p>
<p>What we're asking in Opposition is, where is the evidence that the government previously called for and demanded? Where is that evidence that this is not just an across-the-board tax increase? That's what we would say today: it is an across-the-board tax increase. This $11.8 million, I believe it is, is really a way for the government to add to their coffers by going after every fee and spreading it over every single service that we charge for. The government has found a way to add $11 million - it's $11.6 million, I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker - $11.6 million to the bottom line.</p>
<p>That is not an amount of money that comes to us because of cost recovery. That's an amount of money that was put into that fee increase on the eve of the new fiscal year to help bolster the revenue for this coming year and for the budget that we are here today debating in the House.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, you will know that in my reply to the Budget Address I made it very clear that here in the Liberal caucus we do not believe that the revenue estimates that were included for personal income tax, corporate income tax, and HST revenue that we should be receiving - we don't believe that those are reasonable estimates in the budget. We believe they are inflated, and we believe they are not going to be attained this year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when you raise fees there is every chance that the government can control that, because these are services that people need. If you are in business and you are running an eating establishment, you need a licence. If you are a food handler, you need to take the course. All of these costs are rising.</p>
<p>Again, I mentioned that this is going to harm people who can least afford it. If you want to get information on maintenance enforcement, you'll have to pay more to get information on your maintenance enforcement. There's definitely a fee issued with any garnishment that's going to be done. If you wanted to ask that maybe the errant spouse or parent is not paying the maintenance enforcement, you'll have to pay a larger fee to get that action started.</p>
<p>Additional fees are in place here for apprenticeship training, for example. Here in the House we speak a lot about the need to improve skills training. We just heard the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development talking about how proud she is that we have a program which introduces high school students to trades and skills, and yet we're going to increase the cost here for certificates to do with apprenticeship training. It seems very contradictory. It seems like we're doing something positive with one hand and then slapping people down with the other, making it more difficult for them to attain the skills and the education that they need.</p>
<p>These 1,400 fees will dig a hand into the wallet and into the pocket of every Nova Scotian in the province. This is something that we think is not justifiable. The only way an increase in fees is justified is when the individual departments can come back with a calculation that shows that their fees have risen, their cost of delivering that service has risen by that percentage. If they can show that it's that much more expensive to staff their offices or provide the service that's required, then that's justifiable.</p>
<p>How many fees these days are delivered on-line? The cost there is a lot less, and we're directing more and more of the public to on-line means of getting their licences and renewing permits, and yet at the same time, the government has had the nerve to increase fees by 6 per cent this year alone, and 2 per cent two years earlier.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the NSLC, our Liquor Corporation in the province, jumped the gun and increased their fees on liquor even earlier. Their increases were passed on to the public a day or two earlier than they should have been. There might be a good part to this story, because I understand they're going to give the additional money that they collected back to charity as a result. They're showing the way a lot better - they are at least being accountable for the mistake they made in jumping the gun and putting higher taxes on their product before it was justified on April 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>The big point here is that the NDP have done a complete about-face in the position that they held before the last election, which was that fees should be justified and that evidence should be provided as to what justifies the increase, and if you can't provide that, don't raise those fees. That's the bottom line. Here we are today, four years after an NDP Government got elected with not a shred of evidence that these fees are justified and that we should be actually paying more because it cost more to deliver the service.</p>
<p>The NDP, Mr. Speaker, had one story in Opposition and had done a complete about-face and really disappointed the people of Nova Scotia by raising fees for the second time with no evidence to justify them. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Sackville-Beaver Bank.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#c9bfa1a9-47ac-4d47-b492-7496e858718c"><from>MR. STEPHEN GOUGH</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honour and pride to stand here today and present my response to the Speech from the Throne. I was extremely pleased to see, the first time that I sat in the House, that the House still opens in prayer, and I was a bit surprised, but surprised in a very good way.</p>
<p>I come from a family of 14. Both my mother and father are deceased. There are 14 in my family: nine girls, five boys. To date we have lost two sisters, Kathleen (Kaye) and Brenda, and my oldest brother, Bernard. Growing up wasn't easy, as my mother was a stay-at-home mom, and through her death I am only beginning to know her. My father worked as a concrete finisher for many years until he had a severe stroke and was hospitalized for over a year. After being released from the hospital he began physiotherapy, which helped him relearn how to walk. He worked hard, determined to recover, enabling him to take care of his children. In the end he had a noticeable limp on the left side of his body, and also permanent paralysis to his left arm that restricted him to raise it completely.</p>
<p>Knowing that he could not return to his original profession, fate would have it that a local golf course was about to open next door to our home. When dad learned that they were looking for employees, he decided to apply for a position, and it turned out that the experience that was required, dad had gained many years before working at home and also by working on various farms in the Woodlawn area. Dad spent many years at the Sackville Golf Course until he retired, and I can still remember as a little boy sitting on his lap as we steered the caged tractor while picking up golf balls at the driving range.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, although I come from a family of 14, the first seven who were much older than I had already left home and a few already had families of their own. They were all real blessings, as they were the ones who took care of the home while dad was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Being the oldest boy at home required many responsibilities at a young age. At home we had pigs, chickens and horses. It's amazing how so many things can be accomplished when everyone works together. I am told that I began working at the Sackville Golf Course when I was 10 years old. That is where I learned many things from many people.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as a young boy I would often dream about what I was going to do when I grew up. How was I going to turn out? Was I always going to be poor and struggle as my parents did? Sometimes things that I take for granted today were hardly imaginable at the time of my growing up. Who would have thought that people would have enough faith in me to be their voice in the House of Assembly for Nova Scotia? (Applause)</p>
<p>I feel that I am blessed to be the voice as an elected official for the community in which I grew up - a community that I am so very proud of. Sackville-Beaver Bank is a new riding which I am the first MLA to ever be elected. Sackville is made up of three distinctive parts - Lower, Middle, and Upper. Adjacent to Upper and Middle Sackville, we also have Beaver Bank. All of these areas hold their own place in history.</p>
<p>Upper Sackville is a place where an inventor of yesteryear revolutionized the manner in which people communicated. Mr. Speaker, Charles Fenerty was a Canadian inventor from Upper Sackville who invented the wood pulp process for papermaking which was first adapted into the production of newsprint. Fenerty was also a poet, writing over 32 known poems.</p>
<p>The Fenertys were farmers and lumbermen, and during that period paper was made from rags. Rag paper was not sufficient enough to keep up with the paper demand and a new substitute for making paper had to be found since rags were in short supply.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, many were trying different things to produce a new type of paper, but around 1839 Charles Fenerty started experimenting with wood as a substitute. In 1844 he sent a letter to the Acadian Recorder newspaper with a sample of his pulpwood paper, announcing his discovery of the world's first piece of paper made from pulpwood. It was his invention of a wood-grinding machine that produced the pulp for making paper. His method of pulp making is still used today. By advancing paper into an unlimited supply, Fenerty became one of the great revolutionists in communications during the Industrial Revolution. His paper invention did for the world that the Internet has done for us today - making the transfer of information so much easier.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, little attention was given and Mr. Fenerty himself never pursued his idea as he never took out a patent on his process, but it was his idea that marked the beginning to a new industry - although today most people attribute F.G. Keller as the original inventor. Fenerty was also well-known, as I said, with his poems and many love to listen and hear the poems that he would recite. He travelled to Australia and then returned to Halifax in 1865. He held several positions - wood measurer, census taker, health warden, tax collector for his community, and overseer of the poor. He was also very involved in his church. Fenerty died on June 10, 1892, at his home in Upper Sackville, Nova Scotia, from the flu.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Maroon Hill today - called Middle Sackville - is yet another part of the greater Sackville area that holds its own in history. One of the most interesting events in the history of Atlantic Canada is the arrival of the Jamaican Maroons. These were the descendants of Africans and slaves in Jamaica who had escaped their Spanish slave owners in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> Century. For the next 140 years these freedom fighters fiercely defended their right to live as free and autonomous people. Few outsiders dared approach their strongholds in the mountains of Jamaica. A truce with the British Government in 1738 finally saw the Maroons settled in free communities, the largest in Trelawny Town.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out again in 1795, followed by a treaty in 1796. Accused of breaking the treaty, approximately 600 Maroons from Trelawny Town were sent to Nova Scotia aboard <i>The Dover, The Mary </i>and <i>The Ann. </i>They arrived on June 6, 1796. The Jamaican government agreed to pay the cost of their upkeep. Governor John Wentworth of Nova Scotia wanted to keep the Maroons as a fighting force. They worked extensively on the fortifications of our well-known Citadel Hill, as well as the Government House of that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Duke of Kent formed the Maroons into a militia which was quite useful as a unit designated to protect Fort George, now referred to as the Halifax Citadel. Many were settled on lands in the East and North Preston area and Maroon Hill, today called Middle Sackville. Governor John Wentworth settled many on his own estate in East Preston where his governor's farm was established and his well-documented relationship began with a Maroon woman identified as Sarah Colley, hence the surname Colley originated and is still quite common today in East Preston. In fact, Colley is my wife Leah's maiden name.</p>
<p>Having spent 140 years as comrades-in-arms, the Maroons objected to being divided in this fashion nor did they appreciate being put to work on the governor's estate. However, some Maroons who converted to Christianity were convinced to stay supportive of the British proposals and henceforth removed to the Maroon Hill area, Middle Sackville, as a cheap source of labour to begin cultivating the land. However many objected and petitioned the British Crown in England to resettle in the land of their ancestors, hence leaving Nova Scotia, and on August 7, 1800 approximately 550 Maroons embarked for Freetown, Sierra Leone, in West Africa on board <i>HMS Asia</i>.</p>
<p>A good cross-section of African Nova Scotians today can trace their roots to these proud and noble individuals from the great Ashanti nation of Africa. Their amazing spirit and tremendous tenacity still thrives in their blood, to continue being strong in all the things of life and liberty.</p>
<p>Beaver Bank is a community northeast of Lower Sackville on the Beaver Bank Road within the Halifax Regional Municipality. It is about 35 kilometres from the City of Halifax. As of 2011, its population was estimated at 7,119 families. Today Beaver Bank is a rapidly developing community in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The motto of Beaver Bank is "People Together With Nature". This community is comprised of many lakes, rivers and forests. It has the country feel only minutes from Halifax and Dartmouth. History says that the community dates back to 1776 when Loyalists from Boston arrived. John Henry Barnstead, 1764-1861, and his mother, Mary Brown Parcel Barnstead, arrived there after the War of 1812. George and John Barrett were shopkeepers from Blackthorn, Oxfordshire, England.</p>
<p>In 1816 the Fultz family was granted 1,000 acres of land. Today's Fultz House Museum bears their name in nearby Lower Sackville. Other longstanding families in this area include Lively, the descendants of Rueben Lively, a member of the 96<sup>th</sup> district. An American Loyalist from South Carolina, he was granted 500 acres in the Rawdon Township after the American Revolutionary War in 1784.</p>
<p>Shunamon (Sch&#xF6;enmann), descendants of Carl Ludwig Sch&#xF6;enmann of Eisfeld, Germany. A former Hessian soldier in the American Revolutionary War, he arrived in Beaver Bank prior to or during the year 1813.</p>
<p>Among the oldest family names are Dean, Langille, Gilby, Peters, Woods, and Nicholson.</p>
<p>When the Canadian Railway reached Sackville in the mid-1850s, under the direction of Joseph Howe, the first chief commissioner of the Nova Scotia Railway Company, the next step was to construct a station and freight shed. The Beaver Bank Station served the Sackville-Beaver Bank area until 1956, creating business opportunities for lumbermen by shipping their product to Halifax.</p>
<p>Daniel Hallisey of County Cork, Ireland, was one of the builders of the original railway. He became the first stationmaster. In 1856, he built a house/hotel next to the station, which many say served more as a tavern than anything else. The house offered the new assets of a telegraph and post office, which ran for 99 years. Sir Robert Borden was often present at this house for entertainment.</p>
<p>Today the Beaver Bank Station building remains at the corner of the Beaver Bank Road and Windgate Drive (formerly known as the Windsor Junction Crossroad), and has been converted into a pub called the Black Crow, now closed.</p>
<p>The Grove family offers a rich contribution to Beaver Bank history. Originally from England, the siblings moved to Nova Scotia after living in Philadelphia for several years. The four Grove sisters quickly established a reputation in Halifax due to their prestigious finishing school in the downtown area. They were described as, "Those four English sisters whose ability and character influenced for good such a large number of young ladies of that generation."</p>
<p>Woodlands, the Grove residence, was built in Beaver Bank in 1847. The two Grove brothers lived on the property, profiting from sawmilling, brickmaking, farming, and box-making. In 1880, their sisters returned and established the Grove School for Young Ladies in its place, which ran until destroyed by fire in 1943.</p>
<p>One or all of the Grove sisters are the writer(s) of what is thought to be the first piece of children's literature written in Nova Scotia - possibly even Canada - titled <i>Little Grace or Scenes in Nova Scotia</i>. The sisters also are the main influence behind the construction of the first Anglican Church in Beaver Bank in 1886: the Church of the Good Shepherd. The original church was sold in 1998 to a private buyer and removed from its foundation.</p>
<p>Today it is located in the Township of Chester and used for private purposes. Frances Shunamon (McCarron, n&#xE9;e Grove) donated the land in her newly-developed "Shunamon Subdivision" to house the newer and current Church of the Good Shepherd, which still stands today.</p>
<p>The RCAF Station Beaver Bank was a long-range, Pinetree Line early warning radar station operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, located in Beaver Bank, or what is known by many as "the base". RCAF Station Beaver Bank was approximately 40 kilometres north of Halifax-Dartmouth. The station sat on 430 acres with about a half-mile separation between the domestic and the operations site, both sites being divided by the county line between Halifax County (the domestic site) and Hants County (the operations site).</p>
<p>The 22 Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was the operational unit posted to the station, its colours having been created in 1953 and the unit made operational a year later, in the Fall of 1954. The radar unit itself was manually operated and reported to the Fredericton NORAD Sector at RCAF Station St. Margarets until September 1962, when this was changed to the Bangor NORAD Sector at Topsham AFS, Maine.</p>
<p>The 22 AC&amp;W became SAGE-operational on January 1, 1964; however, this capability did not last long, as the station was closed and the squadron disbanded four months later, on April 1, 1964, following a NORAD realignment and increasing focus being placed on the DEW Line.</p>
<p>Royal Canadian Air Force Station Beaver Bank occupied a unique location and proximity to Canada's largest Atlantic seaport and its largest naval base, making it an important early warning radar base during the manual environment of the 1950s. Since manned bomber raids by the Soviet Union in the area were considered quite likely, it was felt that RCAF station Beaver Bank fulfilled a critical role in the early days of Canada's and North America's air defence.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the station was originally financed by the United States Air Force, although operational responsibility rested with the RCAF until 1962, when the RCAF assumed financial responsibility as well. In the mid-1970s the base was converted for a short time into a cement plant. This was used for only a few years before the base was abandoned completely.</p>
<p>In the 1950s residents of Beaver Bank had close access to the first Sackville drive-in theatre; a car race track, a drag strip called Drag City; Sackville Downs Raceway in the Downsview area; and Sackville Golf Course, a driving range and nine-hole, par-three course.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Beaver Bank is often misspelled as one word - Beaverbank - as it was misprinted on provincial signs for much of the 1980s and 1990s. After the community rallied together in protest for many years, the province reissued the signs with the correct spelling. There are still a few signs in the province that have not been corrected. As some early texts, such as newspapers, spelled Beaver Bank as one word, many of the older residents still consider that spelling to be correct.</p>
<p>Beaver Bank continues to grow exponentially. One of if not the oldest business still operating and employing people in the community is Barrett Lumber Limited. There is Chen's Variety Store on the Beaver Bank Road and restaurants such as Beaver Bank Pizza, located on the cross-section between Beaver Bank Road and Woodbine Avenue, and Foosing Chinese restaurant, located before the Beaver Bank Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are also two golf courses: Lost Creek Golf Club, a 19-hole championship golf course within a residential community, located in Lost Creek subdivision; and Emerson Ridge Driving Range, located across from Beaver Bank's well-known Brown Hall. Also, there are a few day care facilities in the community as well: First Memories Day Care, located on the Beaver Bank Road beside Woodbine Trailer Park homes; Peachtree Children's Centre located at 971 Wind Gate Drive, formerly known as the Windsor Junction Crossroad, located inside the Cross Roads Wesleyan Church, beside the Black Crow pub; Rachel's Day Care, a private, in-home day care located off Beaver Bank Road, on Majestic Avenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the riding of Sackville-Beaver Bank has developed through changes in many ways over the years, to have and continue to be dynamic communities that hold many future opportunities through a focused vision toward open-minded development. Our large land mass dictates development that is required by new and existing families. Also, the only thing that hinders this future development is economics.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the future of Sackville-Beaver Bank can be so much more than subdivisions and used car lots. The large land mass of Sackville-Beaver Bank dictates the fact that, as a community working together, we are the ones who choose our own destiny and together we can make out future a prosperous one.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank first my wife Leah for her growing support. In the beginning she was a bit uncertain about me becoming a politician. This direction was likened also to my decision to become a pastor. I want to thank my sons Alex and Jordan for their encouragement that was and still is very important to me. Alex was with us at caucus when we recognized Take Your Child to Work Day. He was very impressed with Premier McNeil and his new office.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Alex's friends Dewan White, Donovan White, Blake Henry, and Luke Eisner. I want to thank Marc Boutlier who got me to think about the possibilities that are a reality today. He was the one who, after witnessing me chair a meeting, asked: Did you ever think about getting into politics?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the now Premier of Nova Scotia, Stephen McNeil. I remember the first time that I met him in his office and as we were reaching out to shake hands something came to me and it was the memory of an old children's show that was on television, on CBC, many years ago and I've been trying to keep up with what we were beginning to say, the thing that came into my mind was look up, look way up, and I'll call Rusty. Well my name isn't Rusty, but I think Premier McNeil has all kinds of "Rustys" to work along with him in this new adventure that we are a part of.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. BRIAN SKABAR</from>
            <p>Nova Scotia is back to balance. Nova Scotia is now a pay- as-you-go province. We are a pay-as-you-go province, and there are very few of us. There are four pay-as-you-go provinces - four provinces back to balance, and we're the only one in the Atlantic Region that is there. Now it did occur to me, it did occur to many of us, that not everyone is particularly anxious or pleased at an increase in user fees. Most of us don't really much care to pay more for what we're getting. There is an exception however. Of these last batches of user fees there was actually a request from the Nova Scotia Wildlife Habitat group; they asked for an increase in user fees so that the Federation of Anglers and Hunters would be in line to support the Sport Fish Habitat Fund. So there is that.</p>

            <p>Okay, what about the 1,399 to go?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#dca0e259-71bc-4398-a229-98d794836a3d"><from>MR. SKABAR</from><p>Now, getting back to the other 1,399. I get it, and when I speak to constituents they get it as well - delivery of services costs money and if you're going to be a pay-as-you-go province, when the costs increase you pay as you go and you increase the cost to those who are receiving the service.</p>
<p>The benefits from government services for which user fees are charged are charged to those who actually use the service. Those people who don't drive a car, of course, should not be charged for the registration thereof. Those persons who have three cars, or four vehicles in a family, they should be charged the registration of each of those vehicles - they are the ones who are using the service and they are the ones who are charged for it. User fees pay for the services that the people are getting as opposed to general revenue, or as opposed to other sources of tax that are charged for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Opposition asked, in a recent Question Period, how much the cost of a stamp for renewable auto registration was. Well, I don't know what a stamp or a new sticker for a car actually costs, probably less than 5.8 per cent, but the thing is it's not that difficult to figure out the cost of running the Department of Motor Vehicles, divide that by the number of vehicles that are registered, do some simple math, some division, and that's how much it costs.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="##member" status="undefined">
            <from>AN HON. MEMBER</from>
            <p>There's the problem - they can't do simple math over there.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#dca0e259-71bc-4398-a229-98d794836a3d"><from>MR. SKABAR</from><p>Simple math. The cost, of course, of delivering these services isn't the stamp itself, it's the highly professional staff that we have to deliver those services. Efficient, yes. Back in terms of any user fees, the motive fuel tax of course would go to provide for transportation infrastructure. That's what will pay for - a good part, that's what pays for the roads that we drive on. Again, that should not come out of general revenue - but by all means it's the people who are driving on the roads, paying the motive fuel tax, those are the ones who are paying for the roads.</p>
<p>This government did not have the advantage of $450 million a year - I think it's $457 million a year - in revenues from offshore sources. As a matter of fact, we're down to $27 million. Now again, we are a pay-as-you-go province. There have been measures taken by this government to balance the budget and for that, by the way, you are welcome.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the whole balanced budget has definitely changed the water on the beans. It's a fair way to pay as you go. User fees are the ones that pay for the services we need, and that is the action that has taken place. Those who use the services pay the costs, and if you don't own a car, okay, but after that - the fee increases, however, are gradual. There was no increase in user fees last year. This year they went up by 5.8 per cent, that's a combination of two years of user fees in there.</p>
<p>Now, again, the gradual increase of user fees is one thing. An ambulance fee, for example, went up by $2.90 for long-term care residents, and for regular users of the ambulance fee, it went up by $7.79. Now this is really quite different, very, very different than the Hamm Government of 2002, which increased the ambulance fees from $100 to $600 per trip - $600. That is a 600 per cent increase for those who need that service most.</p>
<p>And Liberals, let's talk about the Liberals. Yes, let's do that. In the 1990s, the Liberals decided to put user fees on Pap tests and prostate exams. My goodness gracious, if there is anything that we don't do, it is tax for health services. And of course, my favourite, to this day, I still resent paying $4 every time we have to come to Truro or go to Halifax from Cumberland County, from Amherst. And to my Liberal friends and colleagues across the hall I say, why don't you like us? Why did you do that to us? Highway robbery, that's what that is - the only ones with a toll highway.</p>
<p>Yes, costs are going up. But we're doing this in a humane and civilized way. We are a pay-as-you-go province. We do have a balanced budget, but we also have taken measures to protect our most vulnerable citizens, those most in need. We have programs that waive ambulance costs for low-income families and for seniors. Our government is mindful that Nova Scotians do struggle to make ends meet, many of them do, but we have introduced measures to help those who need the help most. Poverty reduction and affordable living tax credits are putting money in the hands of the people who need it most. Money in the hands that helps them pay - and a good deal more, rather, than they pay in increased HST, for example, or any moderate increase in user fees, the 5.8 per cent of services that they need.</p>
<p>Again, seniors eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement pay no provincial income tax at all - none. All that, and still, the budget is balanced. My colleague across the way took exception, by the sound of it, that the Auditor General, in fact, agreed and endorsed the calculations of our projected revenue for this year. Now, I'm sure we all appreciate the efforts and the opinions of our Auditor General on that, however, we did receive an unqualified opinion as to the projections of revenue to that end.</p>
<p>Some of the 1,400 user fees went up by 3 per cent, some went up by 6 per cent; the average was 5.8 per cent. These are associated with the cost-of-living price index, created by - who creates that, Gary? - the cost-of-living price index, anyway. (Interruption) CPI, that's it.</p>
<p>I might be a little short, I thought I had 10 minutes' worth, but I've got about eight. Another minute? Okay. As far as the user fees go, in our particular (Interruptions) The motive fuel tax is one of the ones that we did make, did have some exceptions to it in Cumberland County. One of the issues that came up during the 2009 campaign was the difference in price of the motive fuel tax in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which did amount to about four to six cents a litre, depending on the Thursday or the Friday that the tax went up.</p>
<p>One of the things that I was hoping to be able to do - and we brought this to the Utility and Review Board - is to create a zone whereby the tax was modified on border areas and increased incrementally by one cent for every 10 kilometres away from the border. This, of course, was reviewed by the Utility and Review Board and rejected.</p>
<p>Again, my colleague, the member for Cumberland South at the time spoke against such a measure to reduce the motive fuel tax in Cumberland County, and as a consequence, the motive fuel board didn't agree with that.</p>
<p>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you and take my place.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to rise this evening to speak to this resolution for late debate. The bullpen part didn't work. The cleanup hitter was the better one.</p>
<p>We just heard from the member opposite that we're now a pay-as-you-go province. I hope that's like pay-per-view television, so we can pick and choose what fees we want to pay, because we don't have that option - 2 per cent on everything in the province's HST four years ago was taking money out of our pockets left and right.</p>
<p>If we are a pay-as-you-go province, how far are we going to go? We've seen it already. We're going to go and turn that corner. I don't know about that corner, but that corner that I've been around here sees a lot more money coming out of people's pockets.</p>
<p>We also had a little lesson on the budget about the Auditor General, what the Auditor General says about that balanced budget. According to what the Auditor General says, and I'll take this right from the letter from the Office of the Auditor General, "Accordingly I express no opinion as to whether the revenue estimates will be achieved." I don't think that's unqualified.</p>
<p>We've had a raised HST, and I think the money that has been taken from each and every Nova Scotian because of that is $1,000 out of each and every Nova Scotian's pocket. I'm glad to see that the NDP are pleased with this, because do you know what? Taking money out of our pockets, when we go to the polls we'll see how pleased the people are about this. They'll pass the judgment if they're happy with this balanced budget or not. We'll see in September when the first forecast is up if they think they've got a truly balanced budget - we'll still be here, and we'll be hearing that budget. If we go before that, we'll assume that budget wasn't going to be balanced.</p>
<p>Now, it's well known that life under this NDP Government is getting harder. Nova Scotia families are struggling. We heard earlier today from the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville about all the jobs that are created here in Halifax. I'm from an area of Cape Breton where there's 30-plus per cent unemployment in my small town - 18.6 per cent unemployment in Cape Breton - and he stood over there and told us that we didn't know what we were talking about, that life in this province is rosy.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, we have the highest taxes in Canada. We have the highest power rates and the fastest-rising prices. Stagnant wages are taking their toll on our families. Our energy rates have gone up 44.5 per cent. In the four years before this government took place, those energy rates went up 6.5 per cent. That's a whopping 37.9 per cent difference, and they are saying life is easier and better for the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>All the province suffers. Even the small- and medium-sized businesses are struggling and having a hard time keeping jobs, let alone creating them. We see that in Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Shelter has gone up over 1 per cent in the four years. Clothing has gone up 7.7 per cent. Goods have gone up 9.5 per cent. Transportation has gone up over 20 per cent. Hard-working people are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. People have to make a decision on power or groceries, prescriptions or power, medication or heat to heat their homes. With higher costs and no extra income, many people are forced to make those difficult decisions.</p>
<p>What happens if we have to fix our roof or get braces for our children? We have to make a decision then: do we fix it or pay the rent? Do we get groceries or fix the roof? Do we get a prescription or fix our car so we can get to our jobs? For far too many Nova Scotians, it's simply not realistic to put a little away for retirement because they're having a tough time making ends meet.</p>
<p>Just when people thought they couldn't take any more from this government, they put the user fees up on over 1,400 government services, over 6 per cent, and that's after 2 per cent two years ago. I recall, once upon a time, the Premier called the increase in user fees across-the-board tax increases, but it doesn't really matter what we call it. Again, it's something that was said in Opposition; it's completely opposite when they are in power. Whether it's called a tax or a fee, for many Nova Scotians it may be more than their family can bear.</p>
<p>On March 28<sup>th</sup> of this year, just before the long Easter weekend, the government announced they were about to reach in the pockets and purses of Nova Scotians again and take an additional $11.6 million in increased user fees. Many of these services are things Nova Scotians can simply not do without. There are 121 pages of new fee increases, 121 pages. Among those increases are fees for home support user fees, which are going up to $12.10 an hour, while the charge for cancelling a home support visit goes up to $59.30 per occurrence. That is not just the elderly who are getting hit by this.</p>
<p>Just as we have this great opportunity with the shipyard contract when thousands of Nova Scotians are going to need training and apprenticeship opportunities, the NDP made that process a little bit harder too; 18 of those 1,400 user fees relate to apprenticeship training. The very thing that we say is necessary for our future, they're now going to tax us on and take more money out of our pockets to do it.</p>
<p>On Page 27 of the 121-page fee increases for ambulances, fees are going up for a normal call. They are going up for residents of long-term care facilities and they are going up for Nova Scotians with mobility problems. Last week the government introduced a bill that would make it easier to get a marriage licence, the "get me to the chapel on time" bill, so on one hand they are making a marriage licence easier to get, but on the other hand they are making it more expensive. That's quite a trade-off.</p>
<p>If they go to the liquor store after that and get booze for their reception, that's going to cost them more money again and if they had it on Easter Saturday, it would be even more again. People of Nova Scotia are probably happy that they are going to make a donation to charity, but probably not happy about the way they did it. If you asked them out front of the liquor store, they probably would have given it before they took it from them.</p>
<p>None of the fee increases is related in any way to the ability of Nova Scotians to pay. It's another tax grab and another way to increase revenue for this government. The burden placed on everyday hard-working people doesn't seem to enter into the equation to this government. They decided they need $11.6 million more and they reached into your pocket and took it. They reached into your purse, your wallet; they are probably reaching into every little child's piggy bank as well. In fact, when asked last week about the user fees, the Minister of Finance said, this is the year the province will move back to a balanced budget.</p>
<p>I have that article here and I'll table that. Balanced on the backs of Nova Scotians who may not be able to afford to pay it; achieving economic goals on the backs of our seniors; people who need ambulances and people attempting to better themselves through apprenticeship training; hard-working Nova Scotians who are already stretched to the limit; it's not what Nova Scotians signed up for. We've heard that it is not my NDP, on more than one occasion from people in this province.</p>
<p>But the lure of easy money was too much for the government. It was powerful enough to cause the Premier to turn his back on what he said in Opposition. It's another case of saying one thing while in Opposition and another thing while in government - it's kind of like his promise to make life easier. We now have 1,400 additional reasons that that claim is simply not true. What the Premier once called across-the-board tax increases, he now calls business as usual. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#c9bfa1a9-47ac-4d47-b492-7496e858718c"><from>MR. GOUGH</from><p>I would like to also thank one of the other folks who helped me along the way; he was part of the chain that led us here today. I want to thank a good friend of mine, Regan Oliver, and his wife, Jennifer, who are continuing encouragers, who told me that everything that I have done in my life - and especially as a volunteer - has prepared me for this great opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Edward Downey and his wife, Angela, who were in total agreement when I asked what they thought about me throwing me hat into the political area - their reply was, why not?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the list could go on and on - my campaign manager Mr. Andrew McNeil and his wife, Nancy; Mr. Pearly Oliver as my official agent and his wife, Carol; Mr. Kirk Mitchel who volunteered at my campaign office after he returned home from work up North, he had seen my name on the sign and he had to find out if it was the old Steve that he knew from years ago in high school, and once he found out that it was me he asked: How can I help? My friends Warren Kelsey, Terry Kelsey, Darrell Kelsey; Mr. Derrick Keel and his wife, Claudette; Ms. Lori Watkins; John and Krista Alfred, and also their eight-year-old daughter, Emily, who is so excited about politics; and Ms. Sylvia Sinclair who is now my CA.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in recognizing these folks by name, I run the risk of possibly insulting someone by not mentioning them - all I can say is that they know who they are and I apologize if I haven't mentioned them by name. Know that I appreciate what you have done and that the faith that you have in me, whether I have mentioned you or not, you made our dream a reality. To have anyone put their faith and trust in you is a humbling reality, they are the ones who see something in you that we personally miss many times. To be an elected official creates many opportunities, they can be financial, social, and for sure is a great self-esteem builder but we must never become complacent towards the people we represent. (Applause)</p>
<p>There are people who have entrusted me to be their voice in this Legislature, who are really struggling - and I must insist on saying it again, there are a lot of people in our province very near to us who are struggling big time. It is easy to lose touch with people we represent if we lose touch, and I've told folks that if you recognize this attitude in me, let me know and I promise I will listen.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when I told my brother Kevin about delivering this speech as a response to the Throne Speech and that I had up to an hour to deliver it, he said: An hour, is that all they're willing to give you?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have had a long and diverse career, first as a transmission technician for over 36 years, a volunteer, a pastor, a concerned citizen who travelled to New York when they needed help, and to Haiti to lend a hand after a devastating earthquake. I have worked with youth in trying to mend relationships that were severed with parents and teachers and their peers.</p>
<p>I have worked in forestry, for that matter, sort of old school, with a horse. Not many people do it anymore, but what an experience - working in the forestry with a horse. I have done work that I have enjoyed when no one else wanted anything to do with it. It isn't work for me because almost everything interests me.</p>
<p>In the 1980s I was a DJ for a very popular cable radio show in Sackville, called the Funk Plaza, which ran for nine years. Frank Magazine got hold of that information from my bio on-line and used it in one of their issues. They called me the Funky Holy Man. In that issue their prayer was: please Lord, let the Funky Holy Man win. Well, I guess their prayers have been answered. If I am to be funky and if I am to be holy, then I want to be the best at it - funky and holy.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone for taking the time to catch a glimpse of who I am, what I have done, and what I plan to do as the voice of Sackville-Beaver Bank. Working together is when government works the best - Nova Scotia first. Thank you.</p></speech>
