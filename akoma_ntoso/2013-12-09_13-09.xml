<p>Whereas studies show that movement can cause the brain to send conflicting signals to the eyes that don't match those transmitted by the inner ear, throwing off Nova Scotia's sense of balance;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House encourage the new Liberal Government to stop flip-flopping on their promises made during the election so Nova Scotians can get back to balance by keeping the NDP's programs and policies.</p>

          <speech by="#lena.m.diab"><from>HON. LENA DIAB</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 20, amendments to the House of Assembly Act, now be read for a second time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to speak on the bill. These amendments relate to the compensation received by members of this House. As my colleagues know, the House of Assembly Act requires that you, Mr. Speaker, must appoint an independent tribunal to review members' salaries within 60 days of an election. The amendments we are discussing today will broaden the scope of that review quite considerably. The review will not only include salaries but it will also include housing allowances, constituency allowances, pensions, and all other types of reimbursements pursuant to the House of Assembly Management Commission Act and all retiring allowances payable to members of the House, pursuant to the Members' Retiring Allowances Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think everyone in this Chamber would agree that Nova Scotians deserve accountability and transparency from their elected officials. As my government made clear in the Speech from the Throne, we must work to ensure that we are protecting the pillars of democracy and keeping pace with the expectations of our citizens. That is why we've committed to a full and thorough review of every form of compensation that members of the House receive.</p>
<p>By expanding this review to include everything at once, Mr. Speaker, we are ensuring that the benefits members receive are fair, responsible, and independently determined by an objective review panel. This is the level of accountability that Nova Scotians expect from us and it's the accountability we are committing to with this piece of legislation.</p>
<p>There is also another item to this legislation that I must draw your attention to. As I mentioned earlier, the current House of Assembly Act requires that you appoint a panel within 60 days of an election and that the panel report back to this House within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>As the amendments we are discussing today are expansive and require an extension on the deadline, Mr. Speaker, under the new legislation you will be required to appoint a three-person review panel on or before December 31<sup>st</sup> - that is the end of this month - and the panel to submit its report to you by the end of March of next year. In other words, they will have about three months to complete their work. The legislation will also allow you to grant the panel an extension, if you deem it necessary.</p>
<p>I think my colleagues would agree that the most important thing here is not to do the review quickly but to do it correctly, so we want to give this panel the time they need to do their work thoroughly and completely.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know all my colleagues in this House are committed to serving their constituents to the best of their abilities and I believe this legislation is the important and proper step to assure Nova Scotians that we are holding ourselves accountable, that we are being fiscally responsible in our use of public funds and that we are devoted to serving the public good.</p>
<p>I look forward to the debate on this legislation and I look forward to seeing it receive the unanimous support of this House. I'm sure you will also be pleased, Mr. Speaker, to have the opportunity to appoint the panel for this important work. With those words I will take my seat. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#kelly.regan"><from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 19, an Act to Amend Chapter 475 of the Revised Statutes, 1989, the Trade Union Act, now be read a second time.</p>
<p>After hearing from many Nova Scotian businesses across the province, we committed to making changes to first contract arbitration. Our business operators should be able to focus on employing Nova Scotians, growing their businesses, and giving back to their communities. It is in everyone's best interest when employers, employees, and unions can resolve their differences through collective bargaining and without labour disruptions.</p>
<p>We are following through on our commitment to restore balance and responsibility to first contract arbitration. The existing legislation involves the Labour Board too quickly. It gives the parties automatic access to first contract arbitration simply by running out a 120-day clock. We said we would fix these problems and that's what we're doing.</p>
<p>Amending the Trade Union Act will ensure the Labour Board can only impose a first contract agreement if it determines one of the parties is not making its best effort to reach a first agreement. The changes will remove the time limits on conciliation and eliminate automatic access to first contract arbitration, giving employers and employees more time to try to negotiate affordable agreements.</p>
<p>The conciliator must now determine that the parties are at an impasse before the matter can go to the Labour Board. If the Labour Board finds the parties are making their best effort to bargain, it may direct the parties back to conciliation. But if the Labour Board determines the parties qualify for first contract arbitration, it can appoint an outside arbitrator or the parties can choose to appear before the Labour Board and cover their own costs. These amendments will restore balance to the process. They will bring Nova Scotia's legislation more in line with the model used by the federal government and several other provinces.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, in the rare instances when employers, employees, and unions struggle to negotiate a first agreement, a more balanced process will be in place to help. These changes ensure that first contract arbitration is a tool of last resort.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, two years ago members of the business communities spoke out against Bill No. 102. Luc Erjavec of the Restaurant and Food Services Association was one of those people. He said the business community was galvanized against this first contract legislation two years ago, and when we introduced these amendments last week, Mr. Erjavec said he was pleased to see the changes we were proposing. He said the amendments are a positive signal to the business community. He said this government listened and acted quickly to bring Nova Scotia's first contract process more in line with other Canadian jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move this legislation for second reading today. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise to speak about Bill No. 19.</p>
<p>As all members know, the Progressive Conservative caucus led the charge against first contract arbitration when the NDP imposed it in 2011. Back then we believed it was a bad bill, and our opinion hasn't changed.</p>
<p>It's a bill that solves a problem that doesn't exist. We are fortunate in this province to have a history of relative labour peace - there is no persistent or ongoing labour discontent; the province had 20 years of a fair and balanced labour market. First contract arbitration is a bill that endangers our already shaky economy, as we all witness on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Back in 2011 we heard what the province's largest employers thought about first contract arbitration - and they didn't like it and they still don't.</p>
<p>Sobeys vice-president of Human Resources called first contract arbitration "totally unnecessary" and said it would damage the province's reputation as an excellent place to work and to carry on business. Mr. Speaker, I will table that document.</p>
<p>Dana LeBlanc of Michelin has this to say about first contract arbitration, "We do not want any third party, who knows nothing about our business, deciding our employment terms and conditions. And risks subjecting us to costs that we cannot afford. That would leave us with very few options." And I will table that document as well.</p>
<p>Mr. LeBlanc went on to say, "It makes my job and other people's job very difficult to sell Nova Scotia as a better place to invest than many of the other sites Michelin has around the world."</p>
<p>Clearwater President Colin MacDonald could not understand why the government introduced the legislation in the first place, saying, "There are other issues the government needs to deal with without riling up the business community" I will table that document as well, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Egg Studios, which I am sure many of you are familiar with in this area, were the unfortunate guinea pigs for first contract arbitration. The contract imposed on Egg would drive up wages and benefits by 25 to 30 per cent and threatens the business's future in the province. I will table that document as well.</p>
<p>Basically first contract arbitration kills jobs. Let's face it, it's a bad policy. This bill tinkers with a bad policy. To take a bad policy and water it down doesn't make it a good policy. Anything that risks jobs is not a risk worth taking. After all, Nova Scotia has 2,400 fewer jobs and 2,600 fewer people in the labour force than this time last year.</p>
<p>Now is the time to concentrate on creating jobs; it is not the time to be fiddling with job-killing legislation. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#frank.corbett"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I suppose I do agree with the previous speaker, it is fiddling, but in it from a whole different perspective. I guess for the record, too, the issue around Egg Films is one about the issues of who's in and who's out of the union. It's not an issue of first contract, for the record, so let's get that straight.</p>
<p>In first contract, the reality is that in order to even get there you have to pass that bar of getting certified. Now I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this province - and I have had the privilege of organizing trade unions in this province and outside this province through provincial legislation and federal legislation. Without fear of being told differently, I would say that Nova Scotia ranks in the top two or three hardest provinces to organize in, because of the tests you have to meet. You have to see first contract legislation through that lens. The lens is that you've passed this huge hurdle, and now you've got to get to the table and get an agreement.</p>
<p>The idea that first contract is a job killer, as portrayed by some, is just not so. Like I said, you have to get that very hard test, that very difficult test to get to even start collective bargaining, because there's no such thing as card check in this province. There's no automatic certification. It's a very, very difficult province in which to organize.</p>
<p>It has been a tactic, if you will, by people at the table to elongate collective bargaining, and part of that is, as they would say, to run out the clock. That has been used many times in this province.</p>
<p>I would submit to you that the need of this legislation today is because - and we were told businesses would flee and so on, and that hasn't happened, so I really don't understand the need for this legislation. The real issue here will be that the bill, in basic terms, says that a contract will be imposed after bad-faith bargaining, because that's basically what it does.</p>
<p>Again, I'll rely on my years of experience previous to this House and say, in this province, if there's an issue of organizing as difficult, then it's 10 times harder to prove bad-faith bargaining. It's a very difficult bar. You have to go - the employer, or the bargaining unit, the person, the group representing the bargaining units - and you have to find hard facts that they did something purposely to impede getting a collective agreement, and did it for less than honest reasons, which is a very, very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>I would think the Progressive Conservative Party should actually be fairly happy with this bill, because with the way this is written, it will basically do away with first contract in this province. That is a shame, because I think the women and men who have asked for certification and met that test will be denied this useful tool in their toolbox. By the fact that an employer was used erroneously in trying to prove that this was the reason, this was the harm being done to an employer, that it was first contract and it wasn't, tells me that's the lack of understanding that Party has when it comes to collective bargaining.</p>
<p>It's an emotional issue right across this province. We can go back to the days of the Michelin bill, go back to all those things. To portray collective bargaining in this province as a walk in the park, so to speak, is truly inaccurate. It's something you see time and time again. You see where certifications will fall by the wayside because there's no avenue open to either party to try to accelerate this. Because what first contract would do, and does do: it allows that period of time for both parties to work under a collective agreement and get to see how the system works and, you know, how they can get along.</p>
<p>I mean the reality is that it gives you the mechanism for a first contract, first, but it doesn't give you any mechanism for a second. So, I mean, if the two parties cannot get to a meaningful resolution of collective bargaining, then there are those other issues that take place as approved by the Trade Union Act. In most cases that would be the ability for a strike or a lockout, Mr. Speaker. So you have those issues and, you know, that's a hammer that people really do not want to use.</p>
<p>I often hear when people talk about the trade union movement and they say, oh, strikes - but again, there's an old adage that it's much easier to get people on the picket line than to get them off the picket line. That's the reality of it. Once out there, you're negotiating with a clock ticking and the one is, do the employees who are affected, do they leave and seek employment elsewhere, does the strike itself cause harm to the employer and cause such an economic issue that they move on themselves?</p>
<p>So, you know, people are cognizant of that on both sides. Most reasonable people, or, I guess, by definition reasonable people - not just most but reasonable people - see that. They see that we have to justify this. We do not want to withdraw our services and the employer says, look, we really don't want to lock our doors. But in the odd case, there are times, a first contract, where both parties are finding their way. This would allow for a much larger and better cooling off period. The cooling off period would actually be a time, Mr. Speaker, when they would work together and find out how this goes.</p>
<p>Most collective agreements, especially the first ones, it's a framework and then it's built on. You would have, in essence, what people would refer to as mature agreements, that probably have been collectively bargained say five to 10 times. After you get that going, usually it's just shaping a few things, maybe adding or taking a step out of the grievance process, or obviously one that's always ever-present for most people would be wages. But the mature agreements, we'd really maybe talk in terms of benefits. Just Friday we sent a bill over to the Law Amendments Committee on a statutory holiday, a holiday type. How is a holiday paid for? Do you negotiate double time? How do you do that if it's your day off and you're called out on that statutory holiday? What should be your reimbursement for that? So they're the ones that I would say fall under the category of a mature agreement, and employers and so on are used to working with that.</p>
<p>Now, first contract is kind of a new venture for both parties, by and large, Mr. Speaker. Some of them can be like a larger company that has a subsidiary that they may be organizing and they have a human resource department that would handle some of the collective bargaining for them. So these things aren't new, but for those that are, these are issues that from time to time, depending on the size of the employer or the size of the union itself, what they would do. They may bring in someone to help them collectively bargain and that person may be a member of the Bar, or it may be somebody else who has been associated with collective bargaining and have put up their shingle, so to speak.</p>
<p>A lot of times it is to find a way to get people to understand - can we work together in a collective bargaining process with a collective agreement in effect? That's what I believe first contract does. I believe these amendments will erode that and make it very much a toothless tiger. I believe that the way it sits today, it works, it works well and therefore our Party will not be supporting this bill going forward. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore- Tracadie.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#lloyd.hines"><from>MR. LLOYD HINES</from><p>I rise with a sense of honour and humble gratitude to stand in this historic place to address my honourable colleagues representing the residents of Nova Scotia's largest geographical riding, the new riding of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie. It is a privilege to serve with my fellow Liberal members, of course, but also with each and every member of this House, in particular the many I have known and worked together with during my time in municipal government. And particular congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment, the wisdom of which you are displaying with great ability, evident in this sitting.</p>
<p>The road to this place is far from being a straight line and along the way there are many places where you need help. I want to briefly mention some of those who provided that help recently and over the years. I must start with my lovely wife of 37 years, Patricia, who has been my solid rock in all that we have accomplished together and without whose encouragement and indulgence I would not be standing before you today. Together we raised four children: Sarah, Shannon, Victoria, and our son Regan, who have shared in every up and down of my political career spanning 11 elections. They have always been there believing in what I have been attempting to accomplish, thank you very much my wonderful family.</p>
<p>Of course, I must mention the super group of believing individuals who are my campaign team. Faced with a new riding, which is vast, we had to build and rebuild networks in areas new to all, but the energetic people who came to my side made it happen. Close to 100 people came to work on our team and each one shares in our victory. People like Shirley, Dan, Bruce, Monica, Shelley, Ed, Cheryll, Milt, Moira and countless others including the granddaughter of my great friend and great Nova Scotian, a man familiar to this House, the late A.M. (Sandy) Cameron. I will be eternally grateful to you all. Thanks to all in the provincial campaign who worked flawlessly to answer every question with an inspiring calmness, thorough knowledge, and instant responsiveness. For a busy candidate, such support is priceless.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign our team kept up constant contact with our neighbouring ridings, and I wish to thank those members for the common vision and co-operation throughout the writ period. One last tip of the hat to my former council colleagues and staff at the Municipality of the District of Guysborough, many of whom were with me for 25 years, for all the ambient support in your manners and good wishes - it means a lot. The bonus for you is that you're rid of me once and for all from your council table.</p>
<p>I should mention, Mr. Speaker, that since the election they were able to have a by-election, elect a new councillor to replace me and elect a new warden for the municipality - so, so much for being indispensable.</p>
<p>And, finally, thank you to our Premier, who accepted my candidacy for a second time and provided constant support throughout the run - it is a great honour to serve in a government led by this man.</p>
<p>Now I want to take you on a short journey through the beautiful and diverse riding of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie. Beginning on the northern shore of our great province, on St. Georges Bay in the Gulf of St. Lawrence at the venerable Port of East Tracadie, from whose wharf our fishermen still ply their ancient trade, around Cape Jack past Havre Boucher, along the Strait of Canso to one of Canada's most prominent, man-made features, the Canso Causeway.</p>
<p>When this construction marvel was completed in 1955, an incredible benefit aside from the ease of access to and from Cape Breton was created. Prior to that time the annual drift ice from the Gulf blocked the Strait of Canso for extended periods, making the deepest port on the East Coast of North America unusable for several months of the year and severely limiting its utility. The new causeway acted as a dam against the ice and has opened up this port for use year-round, which has seen significant industry migrate to the Strait bringing jobs and good economy to the region.</p>
<p>The Strait continues to be recognized for its potential, with an international container terminal under development for Melford in Guysborough Municipality. East Asian interests are in the area scouting for liquefied natural gas sites, and other exciting business opportunities are in the hopper. Wind turbines are now turning on both sides of the Strait, a testament to the many natural advantages the region holds.</p>
<p>Next door to the Causeway lies the beautiful port Town of Mulgrave, long celebrated as the ferry access to Cape Breton and a prolific fishing area. Strategically located close to proposed developments and hosting an international nutraceutical company, Royal DSM, Mulgrave lies poised for growth. Continuing southeast past Steep Creek and Sand Point, we move past a point at Red Head and pass into Chedabucto Bay on the Atlantic, one of the largest bays on Canada's East Coast.</p>
<p>Continuing along the coast, past the sandy beaches of Clam Harbour and Hadley Beach, we reach the sheltered port of Guysborough, the shire town of the Municipality of the District of Guysborough and a bustling community in its own right. Home to the Mulgrave Road Theatre and Chedabucto Place Performance Centre, it has a lively cultural community and tireless volunteers.</p>
<p>Together with a good presence of government services, entrepreneurial efforts abound. The Days Gone By Bakery and restaurant just celebrated 15 years of successful service, and local businesses work hard to provide service to the many surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Recently, Authentic Seacoast has expanded its beer brewing business - it is now listed in the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission - opened a superb coffee roaster and is busy planning a craft distillery for a Spring of 2014 construction, providing badly needed jobs to a rural community.</p>
<p>Near the shire town we find three of Nova Scotia's largest African Nova Scotian communities: Sunnyville, Lincolnville, and Upper Big Tracadie. These residents, whose ancestors date back over 250 years, display their proud traditions with such facilities as the African Canadian Heritage and Friendship Centre, housed in the local school, and an annual festival celebrating their proud heritage. These communities are particularly proud of their African Nova Scotian council representative, Councillor Sheila Pelly, district councillor, for the solid representation that she delivers.</p>
<p>Heading east on Route 16 we pass through the historic community of Queensport, with its iconic island lighthouse; through Hazel Hill, the first Canadian home of Western Union's transatlantic cable site; and enter the oldest fishing area in North America, the historic and proud community of Canso. Home to National Historic Site Grassy Island, which was the staging area for the British Siege of Louisbourg, Mr. Speaker, Canso is now an important renewable energy site with the soon-to-be-turning turbines of the Sable wind farm - to say nothing of the incredible fishing industry currently leading the pack with the development of Nova Scotia's only trapped shrimp fishery.</p>
<p>Around Glasgow Head is tucked the vibrant community of Little Dover, home to several dozen lobster licences that drive the economy, and around the bay to Whitehead and into Tor Bay where Captain Savalet entertained Samuel de Champlain in 1608 - Savalet, who at that point said he had been coming to that bay for many years, harvested the rich waters for fish, which he transported back to France.</p>
<p>La communaut&#xE9; prochaine est la belle ville de Rivi&#xE8;re-de-Larry, maison &#xE0; la Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; des Acadiens de la r&#xE9;gion de Tor Baie. Nous sommes tr&#xE8;s enchant&#xE9;s de cette communaut&#xE9; acadienne, qui ouvre maintenant un nouveau mus&#xE9;e, la Salle des Acadiens.</p>
<p>Along the coast, through many more historic communities, too numerous to name, takes us to Goldboro, named originally for the great Nova Scotia gold play of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and now the host community to the first offshore natural gas development in this country, Mr. Speaker. Now hosting a second gas project in Canada's Deep Panuke; first gas from those reservoirs is expected to be announced any day. Further still, host to an active application to locate eastern Canada's first liquefied natural gas export terminal at that port - Goldboro: truly Nova Scotia's energy hub.</p>
<p>Moving west through the deep fjord known as Country Harbour, we reach Stormont, sporting the landing spot for Mersey Seafoods' Greenland shrimp fishery. That's a huge fishery, Mr. Speaker, employing many, many people in the area. Further west, we travel across the ferry to Port Bickerton, with its very active Lighthouse Association, to the shire town of the Municipality of the District of St. Mary's, historic Sherbrooke. Here sits the Nova Scotia Museum's Historic Sherbrooke Village, a living museum of world renown. I would truly invite members to take a relaxing ride and visit Nova Scotia's Liscombe Lodge in nearby Liscombe and try their famous planked salmon.</p>
<p>Continuing along Highway No. 7, we pass through seaside Marie Joseph to Ecum Secum, marking the border into municipality number five that comprises the Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie riding, Halifax Regional Municipality. Onward through Necum Teuch, Moser River, the Quoddys, Port Dufferin - home to the soon-to-be-producing gold mine at Dufferin Mines being developed by Ressources Appalaches.</p>
<p>And now, we enter into the outskirts of the anchor community of eastern Halifax Regional Municipality, Sheet Harbour. Sheet Harbour is a busy and bustling community serving a large catchment area. It serves as the business centre and service centre for the large region. An extremely active and effective board of trade led by the business community provides yeomen service for the area. Long a great renewable energy centre harnessing the hydro power from the East and West Rivers as they flow into the Atlantic, the area remains an important contributor to the provincial power grid. Centre for an active arts community and host to one of the province's best ports, Sheet Harbour Port, the future is bright for this great area.</p>
<p>Pushing still westward, Mr. Speaker, we pass through the lovely tourist areas of Spry Bay, Mushaboom, Tangier, and Murphy Cove, arriving at the western-most boundary of this magnificent riding at East Ship Harbour at Newcombe Brook, and the beginning boundary of the riding represented by our Speaker. So there you have it: a journey of over 500 kilometres, over 5,100 square kilometres, and home to approximately 10,500 electors.</p>
<p>Please grant me your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, to speak about our strong people and their economy. With almost 20 per cent of Nova Scotia's coast, it is therefore obvious that the importance of the fishery is paramount to our people. Inshore and offshore landings are significant, and over 300 lobster fishers under licence risk life and limb in the pursuit of Nova Scotia's sweetest crustaceans, found in these Eastern Shore pristine waters. No debate on that - good. Indeed, this fishery represents our last bastion against out-migration, with young men and women staying in their home communities to continue the family tradition of fishing, blessing our schools with their children, and being economic generators in their respective communities.</p>
<p>Then there is the forestry. Centuries of stewardship of our forests by our predecessors gifted us with viable forests which, with careful husbandry, will continue to be productive for future generations.</p>
<p>Farming is an important vocation in the riding, with dairy, beef, huge blueberry production, and thousands of acres of balsam fir Christmas tree production that has supplemented incomes for decades. All these activities have helped create an incredible tourist product throughout the riding, as the natural advantages of great rivers and intriguing coastal areas catch the traveller's imagination and bring visitors to our communities for experiential tourism.</p>
<p>These are the traditional industries in the riding, but let's turn our attention to the future. Starting with energy, the Sable Offshore Energy Project has been heating homes and businesses throughout Atlantic Canada since 2000. A second billion-dollar offshore investment has landed on the riding's shores at Goldboro, with the Encana Deep Panuke gas project. It's nearing first gas and, together with the Sable project, will put millions more dollars into the royalty coffers of the province. Because Goldboro is the beginning point of the Maritimes &amp; Northeast transmission pipeline, that piece of infrastructure has attracted investors who plan to establish Eastern Canada's first liquefied natural gas export terminal.</p>
<p>Some facts about this project, Mr. Speaker : send-out capacity up to 10 million tons per year; capital expenditures, $5 billion to $10 billion Canadian. Yes, I did say "billion". Up to 3,500 workers for 36 to 42 months, to build the facility; 200 direct jobs in the operating state; and countless spinoff opportunities for small business. This project is now before the Nova Scotia Department of Environment for environmental assessment, and recently an application was prepared for the National Energy Board for an import-export permit for that project.</p>
<p>On the renewable side, COMFIT turbines are producing income for residents, and a 13.8 megawatt wind farm is under construction near Hazel Hill and Canso.</p>
<p>The mining sector is very important to the riding, with a renewed gold mine scheduled for operation in early 2014, which will employ 78 people at Dufferin Mines in the Sheet Harbour region. Martin Marietta operates eastern Canada's largest aggregate mine at Cape Porcupine near Auld's Cove, employing just shy of 100 people. A second aggregate export development is in the advanced planning stages on tidewater, just 11 kilometres from the community of Canso, with a projected workforce of 80 and a capital cost approaching $100 million.</p>
<p>Another prolific gold deposit at Goldboro is being proven up, and Orex Corporation, a gold developer, is preparing to file a permit for a 10,000-ton bulk sample which will confirm the future mine's viability.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, on the Strait of Canso at Melford, we have a well-advanced proposal for an international container terminal, and that wonderful, ice-free, deep-water port that I mentioned was made possible by the advent of the Canso Causeway. The capital projection for that project was $400 million and 200 jobs in the operating phase, and we in rural Nova Scotia need those jobs to build the economy back for this province.</p>
<p>Woven throughout the economy of the riding is the ever-present tourism industry along the shore from East Ship Harbour, through to Sherbrooke, through to Canso with its famous Stan Rogers Festival, which I invite everyone in the House to take in. It's a marvellous activity. Along the shore to East Tracadie lies some of Canada's most scenic geography. Unique tourist businesses have their shingles out - showing strong spirit to entertain the incredulous visitors who are enchanted by the spectacular beauty. Authentic Seacoast at Guysborough is one of those businesses that is making a significant mark with its various offerings, including a coffee roaster - served here recently in the House, Mr. Speaker, their coffee - an Internet caf&#xE9; and trading company featuring decadent pastries created onsite, a craft brewery, and soon to be joined by a craft distillery - all of which contribute to more jobs for our important rural economy.</p>
<p>I look forward with vigour and excitement to representing the wonderful people of Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie in this historic Assembly. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Hammonds Plains-Lucasville.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ben.jessome"><from>MR. BEN JESSOME</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to address this House of Assembly today and represent my hometown that I've lived in for more than 20 years of my life. I've shared incredible memories with my family, friends, and neighbours in the area through things like going through the school system, playing competitive sports, as a member of various church congregations, and being involved in several community organizations. I look forward to the opportunity to be the collective voice for my hometown, my brothers and sisters in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention that I'm grateful for the privilege to work in this House with the representatives on all sides of the House who have all demonstrated in one way or another their ability to encourage their constituents, who have a great deal of knowledge and experience in their respective former careers, and the abilities which I believe have the potential to contribute to the improvement of our province as a whole.</p>
<p>I also just wanted to take a quick moment, Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a point to recognize the member for Pictou West for inspiring such an impressive voter turnout in her riding. I think that we should recognize that as the House. (Applause) I hope that we can all continue to inspire Nova Scotians and get some more people out to the polls next time around.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm happy to be a part of this House of Assembly, filled with former lawyers, first responders, farmers, educators, municipal representatives, entrepreneurs, as well as the former members of the House and more. I am additionally grateful that we're accompanied by the member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley and the member to my left, the member for Sackville-Beaver Bank. Honestly, gentlemen, pray for us.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians deserve nothing except our best and I look forward to our collective contributions to change. I hope that we can move toward enhancing this province, modernizing this Legislature, achieving the best possible results for our province through constructive debate, and restoring the faith of a declining voting population.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to share a few interesting points with regard to my community and pieces that contribute to why I'm very proud to be the representative for Hammonds Plains-Lucasville. Upper Hammonds Plains is home to Pockwock Lake, perhaps more commonly known as the Pockwock Watershed where HRM gets its drinking water. Hammonds Plains is home to the Wallace Hills Indian Reserve - historically a stopping place for the Mi'kmaq First Nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Upper Hammonds Plains Volunteer Fire Department, originally opened by 48 volunteers in 1966, was officially established in 1970 - therefore making Upper Hammonds Plains the home to the first all-Black fire department in Canada. Upper Hammonds Plains is additionally the home of now retired Lieutenant Gina Jones-Wilson who was the first female African Canadian to achieve a Level 1 firefighting certification in our province and continues to be an activist within our community.</p>
<p>The Upper Hammonds Plains Volunteer Fire Department was made possible by the efforts of the local community. The Ladies Auxiliary from Emmanuel Baptist Church contributed to the fundraising efforts and the land for the fire hall was donated by community resident Mrs. Elizabeth Mantley. Elizabeth's daughter, Doreen Mantley, still lives in Upper Hammonds Plains, is a fantastic person and an incredible cook - though I will state for the record that my mom still holds the title.</p>
<p>Speaking of Emmanuel Baptist Church - or EBC: The MEETing Place - it celebrates the rich legacy of its founding members, three Black refugees of the War of 1812 who first settled in Upper Hammonds Plains. This place of celebration is truly a central point in our community and beyond. People come from far and wide to be part of this experience and whether you are deeply religious or not, the people who make up the congregation at Emmanuel - led by Pastor Lennett Anderson - are the most welcoming group I have ever met. I encourage everyone in this House, and anywhere, to make a point to attend a service as our Premier did the first Sunday of the election.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I need to give a sincere thank you to the congregation at EBC, for Sundays were an opportunity to reflect, relax, and recharge during the months leading up to and throughout the campaign. The strength that carried me because of my participation at Emmanuel was integral to the success of my campaign. I'm happy to say that such a powerful place, filled with incredible people, is in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville just up the road, and I look forward to continue being a part of the celebration. Again, these are only a few significant pieces of my community's history and I look forward to the opportunity to learn more.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I represent a newly-formed riding. The redistribution of the provincial boundaries formed Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, a riding that incorporates, more exclusively, the place that I've called home. This was a major contribution to why I decided to put my name forward. I have great confidence speaking on our behalf and I'm committed to doing so. I grew up in HPL playing competitive sports, for example, for TASA Minor Hockey, Halifax County United Soccer, Hammonds Plains Soccer as well as playing for the Bay Ducks organization in the Maritime Junior League. I want to thank the people who continue to make these organizations successful and enable opportunities for wellness through sport in our community.</p>
<p>Hammonds Plains-Lucasville is a community that is home to more than 10 extended families of mine, which is extremely inspirational. I'm privileged to be connected to so many wonderful people throughout my riding, for example through church, sport, school, family, and various community groups. The election campaign was a great opportunity to meet new people, reconnect with people I hadn't seen for quite some time, and hear their collective testimonial, which supported a lot of what I understood about the area.</p>
<p>Our community is the site for many small businesses and hardworking entrepreneurs. It is additionally a thoroughfare to the Lighthouse Route and the beautiful South Shore region of the province, though I will add, a thoroughfare, whether the road can handle it or not, is just a shortcut. The area is comprised mainly of, but not limited to, young families and senior citizens. It is evident, based on our demographics, that this is a community where parents are eager to raise their family and senior citizens, many of whom have raised their families in the community, intend to spend their retirement.</p>
<p>I am confident in my understanding of our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and our challenges. I look forward to expressing them in this Chamber, throughout this mandate, and working hard to ensure that we maximize our opportunities in HPL.</p>
<p>Before I delve into the concerns of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, I need to take a moment to recognize some of the people who contributed their time, talents and treasure, helping me put together my campaign, a successful campaign. Bill Crawley was my campaign manager; Darrell Jessome was my official agent - Darrell is also my father and a former colleague of the member for Pictou East; Ben MacDonald, assistant to the official agent; Jillian MacDonald, Ben's sister, was the candidate scheduler; Ariel Gough was our social media and Web site chair; Matthew Heffler was our written communications; Rob MacLaughlin was our sign chair; Terry Bent, Kathy Baker and Clark Swim were our office managers; Cameron Stoddard was our volunteer coordinator; John Jessome, my brother, and Callie Butler were fundraising co-chairs; Erik Mistal; our get-out-the-vote coordinator; Joseph Landry and Brian Gazeley, our election night coordinators; Peter Covert; my mother Pam; and my two other brothers, Nicholas and Matthew.</p>
<p>Frankly, there are a number of individuals who I could continue to address but I just felt compelled to mention these people in particular, where a group that didn't have the most experience in the world but we all had various abilities, which really contributed to a fantastic team. I hope everybody will stay committed, stay engaged and recognize that we can all add a lot of value to any room we go into. I look forward and hope they'll be around in four years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I mentioned the fact that I lived in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville for the majority of my life so I have a pretty firm understanding of the lay of the land. My canvassing efforts were certainly an emphasis on what I understand and I'm going to share some of the things that I heard at the doorsteps.</p>
<p>Firstly, our subdivisions have grown exponentially and continue to blossom in Hammonds Plains-Lucasville. Despite population declining in many places around the province, our community continues to explode with new residents. While I appreciate and understand the desire to move to our community, the scary fact is that the means of safe transportation has barely enhanced over time.</p>
<p>I won't complain about paving, other than on the Pockwock Road, but the Hammonds Plains and Lucasville Roads are a commuter's nightmare and a daily threat. There are presently 20,000-plus vehicles that travel on the two-lane Hammonds Plains Road daily. Mr. Speaker, the Hammonds Plains and Lucasville thoroughfares are of the utmost concern to residents. Having spent the majority of my life here, experiencing little change and reading through some of the testimonials of former representatives of this House of Assembly who have addressed the same concern, I wonder what it is going to take for someone to react and enable the upgrade that we need so desperately. The safety of our children waiting for the school bus and the safety of our hard-working Nova Scotians commuting to work to provide for their families, for example, is a perpetually escalating problem and needs to be addressed by the province, in conjunction with other municipal and federal partners.</p>
<p>Secondly, anxiety around the education system is major. For example, the size of classes, lacking resources for educators, support staff and administrators and the strains that are placed on these individuals and the students they teach are all genuine concerns that I hear door-to-door.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are so many who are more than capable and committed to enhancing the lives of the next generation through education but they need our help. We can do so much more, as a province, to ensure that young Nova Scotians maximize their potential in the classroom and evolve into the leaders of tomorrow. I am thrilled that there is so much emphasis in this room with regard to prioritizing education, restoring financial cuts and, in particular, updating the curriculum. Frankly, I'm hoping and willing to advocate for consideration for mandatory courses, especially at the secondary level, pertaining to current issues, economics and financial literacy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the state of the economy in Nova Scotia is of grave concern and the people of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville are no strangers to this reality. Businesses and residents in our community have concerns regarding our tax dollars, how much it costs for businesses to function and for an individual family to own and maintain a house.</p>
<p>There is also present concern for economic expansion in terms of job creation, which I realize is a problem recognized throughout the province and that there is much determination in this room to keep my generation, the next generation, and skilled workers in general, from migrating.</p>
<p>Health care is another huge concern for residents of Hammonds Plains-Lucasville, in particular with regard to wait times, the pressure placed on front-line health care, and the means by which we provide long-term and end-of-life care for our seniors. Additionally, I'd like to emphasize the need for this House of Assembly to place emphasis on increasing our capacity for supporting Nova Scotians with various cognitive disabilities and mental illness. This includes, but isn't limited to, autistic youth trying to fit into classrooms and social circles; young adults feeling depressed and alone as they transition from adolescence into adulthood, in a world with seemingly insurmountable expectations; mothers and fathers who are feeling the weight of family pressures in ensuring their children have the best possible future; veterans returning from service after having faced the ultimate sacrifice to protect our rights and freedoms; and a senior population that is increasingly suffering from cases of dementia.</p>
<p>I won't ignore the recognition for its existence and the work that has been accomplished surrounding mental illness in the recent past. However, as someone who lost one of his best friends to depression, I really want to express this for the record. For many challenged with mental illness, negative public stigma is deathly isolating. Our collective inability to recognize someone in need is likely based on ignorance, but the more depression and suicide continue, the more we walk the line of insensitivity.</p>
<p>Our present ability to help individuals seek adequate support, individuals who need our listening ear and helping hand more than ever, is lacking - and for me, completely unacceptable. There is so much more we can contribute, and as a member of this government I ask everyone in this room to grab this beast by the horns so that our brothers and sisters can get the support they need to tame their demons.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm going to close very simply by thanking everyone who made it possible for me to be here today and say that I'm looking forward to being a part of the solution. I'm committed to working hard. I'm committed to doing my part, playing my role, and doing whatever it takes to be a good part of Team Nova Scotia and ensure our success. Thank you for the opportunity to submit my Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. Peace and God bless. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable member for Sackville-Beaver Bank.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#stephen.gough"><from>MR. STEPHEN GOUGH</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honour and pride to stand here today and present my response to the Speech from the Throne. I was extremely pleased to see, the first time that I sat in the House, that the House still opens in prayer, and I was a bit surprised, but surprised in a very good way.</p>
<p>I come from a family of 14. Both my mother and father are deceased. There are 14 in my family: nine girls, five boys. To date we have lost two sisters, Kathleen (Kaye) and Brenda, and my oldest brother, Bernard. Growing up wasn't easy, as my mother was a stay-at-home mom, and through her death I am only beginning to know her. My father worked as a concrete finisher for many years until he had a severe stroke and was hospitalized for over a year. After being released from the hospital he began physiotherapy, which helped him relearn how to walk. He worked hard, determined to recover, enabling him to take care of his children. In the end he had a noticeable limp on the left side of his body, and also permanent paralysis to his left arm that restricted him to raise it completely.</p>
<p>Knowing that he could not return to his original profession, fate would have it that a local golf course was about to open next door to our home. When dad learned that they were looking for employees, he decided to apply for a position, and it turned out that the experience that was required, dad had gained many years before working at home and also by working on various farms in the Woodlawn area. Dad spent many years at the Sackville Golf Course until he retired, and I can still remember as a little boy sitting on his lap as we steered the caged tractor while picking up golf balls at the driving range.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, although I come from a family of 14, the first seven who were much older than I had already left home and a few already had families of their own. They were all real blessings, as they were the ones who took care of the home while dad was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Being the oldest boy at home required many responsibilities at a young age. At home we had pigs, chickens and horses. It's amazing how so many things can be accomplished when everyone works together. I am told that I began working at the Sackville Golf Course when I was 10 years old. That is where I learned many things from many people.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as a young boy I would often dream about what I was going to do when I grew up. How was I going to turn out? Was I always going to be poor and struggle as my parents did? Sometimes things that I take for granted today were hardly imaginable at the time of my growing up. Who would have thought that people would have enough faith in me to be their voice in the House of Assembly for Nova Scotia? (Applause)</p>
<p>I feel that I am blessed to be the voice as an elected official for the community in which I grew up - a community that I am so very proud of. Sackville-Beaver Bank is a new riding which I am the first MLA to ever be elected. Sackville is made up of three distinctive parts - Lower, Middle, and Upper. Adjacent to Upper and Middle Sackville, we also have Beaver Bank. All of these areas hold their own place in history.</p>
<p>Upper Sackville is a place where an inventor of yesteryear revolutionized the manner in which people communicated. Mr. Speaker, Charles Fenerty was a Canadian inventor from Upper Sackville who invented the wood pulp process for papermaking which was first adapted into the production of newsprint. Fenerty was also a poet, writing over 32 known poems.</p>
<p>The Fenertys were farmers and lumbermen, and during that period paper was made from rags. Rag paper was not sufficient enough to keep up with the paper demand and a new substitute for making paper had to be found since rags were in short supply.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, many were trying different things to produce a new type of paper, but around 1839 Charles Fenerty started experimenting with wood as a substitute. In 1844 he sent a letter to the Acadian Recorder newspaper with a sample of his pulpwood paper, announcing his discovery of the world's first piece of paper made from pulpwood. It was his invention of a wood-grinding machine that produced the pulp for making paper. His method of pulp making is still used today. By advancing paper into an unlimited supply, Fenerty became one of the great revolutionists in communications during the Industrial Revolution. His paper invention did for the world that the Internet has done for us today - making the transfer of information so much easier.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, little attention was given and Mr. Fenerty himself never pursued his idea as he never took out a patent on his process, but it was his idea that marked the beginning to a new industry - although today most people attribute F.G. Keller as the original inventor. Fenerty was also well-known, as I said, with his poems and many love to listen and hear the poems that he would recite. He travelled to Australia and then returned to Halifax in 1865. He held several positions - wood measurer, census taker, health warden, tax collector for his community, and overseer of the poor. He was also very involved in his church. Fenerty died on June 10, 1892, at his home in Upper Sackville, Nova Scotia, from the flu.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Maroon Hill today - called Middle Sackville - is yet another part of the greater Sackville area that holds its own in history. One of the most interesting events in the history of Atlantic Canada is the arrival of the Jamaican Maroons. These were the descendants of Africans and slaves in Jamaica who had escaped their Spanish slave owners in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> Century. For the next 140 years these freedom fighters fiercely defended their right to live as free and autonomous people. Few outsiders dared approach their strongholds in the mountains of Jamaica. A truce with the British Government in 1738 finally saw the Maroons settled in free communities, the largest in Trelawny Town.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out again in 1795, followed by a treaty in 1796. Accused of breaking the treaty, approximately 600 Maroons from Trelawny Town were sent to Nova Scotia aboard <i>The Dover, The Mary </i>and <i>The Ann. </i>They arrived on June 6, 1796. The Jamaican government agreed to pay the cost of their upkeep. Governor John Wentworth of Nova Scotia wanted to keep the Maroons as a fighting force. They worked extensively on the fortifications of our well-known Citadel Hill, as well as the Government House of that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Duke of Kent formed the Maroons into a militia which was quite useful as a unit designated to protect Fort George, now referred to as the Halifax Citadel. Many were settled on lands in the East and North Preston area and Maroon Hill, today called Middle Sackville. Governor John Wentworth settled many on his own estate in East Preston where his governor's farm was established and his well-documented relationship began with a Maroon woman identified as Sarah Colley, hence the surname Colley originated and is still quite common today in East Preston. In fact, Colley is my wife Leah's maiden name.</p>
<p>Having spent 140 years as comrades-in-arms, the Maroons objected to being divided in this fashion nor did they appreciate being put to work on the governor's estate. However, some Maroons who converted to Christianity were convinced to stay supportive of the British proposals and henceforth removed to the Maroon Hill area, Middle Sackville, as a cheap source of labour to begin cultivating the land. However many objected and petitioned the British Crown in England to resettle in the land of their ancestors, hence leaving Nova Scotia, and on August 7, 1800 approximately 550 Maroons embarked for Freetown, Sierra Leone, in West Africa on board <i>HMS Asia</i>.</p>
<p>A good cross-section of African Nova Scotians today can trace their roots to these proud and noble individuals from the great Ashanti nation of Africa. Their amazing spirit and tremendous tenacity still thrives in their blood, to continue being strong in all the things of life and liberty.</p>
<p>Beaver Bank is a community northeast of Lower Sackville on the Beaver Bank Road within the Halifax Regional Municipality. It is about 35 kilometres from the City of Halifax. As of 2011, its population was estimated at 7,119 families. Today Beaver Bank is a rapidly developing community in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The motto of Beaver Bank is "People Together With Nature". This community is comprised of many lakes, rivers and forests. It has the country feel only minutes from Halifax and Dartmouth. History says that the community dates back to 1776 when Loyalists from Boston arrived. John Henry Barnstead, 1764-1861, and his mother, Mary Brown Parcel Barnstead, arrived there after the War of 1812. George and John Barrett were shopkeepers from Blackthorn, Oxfordshire, England.</p>
<p>In 1816 the Fultz family was granted 1,000 acres of land. Today's Fultz House Museum bears their name in nearby Lower Sackville. Other longstanding families in this area include Lively, the descendants of Rueben Lively, a member of the 96<sup>th</sup> district. An American Loyalist from South Carolina, he was granted 500 acres in the Rawdon Township after the American Revolutionary War in 1784.</p>
<p>Shunamon (Sch&#xF6;enmann), descendants of Carl Ludwig Sch&#xF6;enmann of Eisfeld, Germany. A former Hessian soldier in the American Revolutionary War, he arrived in Beaver Bank prior to or during the year 1813.</p>
<p>Among the oldest family names are Dean, Langille, Gilby, Peters, Woods, and Nicholson.</p>
<p>When the Canadian Railway reached Sackville in the mid-1850s, under the direction of Joseph Howe, the first chief commissioner of the Nova Scotia Railway Company, the next step was to construct a station and freight shed. The Beaver Bank Station served the Sackville-Beaver Bank area until 1956, creating business opportunities for lumbermen by shipping their product to Halifax.</p>
<p>Daniel Hallisey of County Cork, Ireland, was one of the builders of the original railway. He became the first stationmaster. In 1856, he built a house/hotel next to the station, which many say served more as a tavern than anything else. The house offered the new assets of a telegraph and post office, which ran for 99 years. Sir Robert Borden was often present at this house for entertainment.</p>
<p>Today the Beaver Bank Station building remains at the corner of the Beaver Bank Road and Windgate Drive (formerly known as the Windsor Junction Crossroad), and has been converted into a pub called the Black Crow, now closed.</p>
<p>The Grove family offers a rich contribution to Beaver Bank history. Originally from England, the siblings moved to Nova Scotia after living in Philadelphia for several years. The four Grove sisters quickly established a reputation in Halifax due to their prestigious finishing school in the downtown area. They were described as, "Those four English sisters whose ability and character influenced for good such a large number of young ladies of that generation."</p>
<p>Woodlands, the Grove residence, was built in Beaver Bank in 1847. The two Grove brothers lived on the property, profiting from sawmilling, brickmaking, farming, and box-making. In 1880, their sisters returned and established the Grove School for Young Ladies in its place, which ran until destroyed by fire in 1943.</p>
<p>One or all of the Grove sisters are the writer(s) of what is thought to be the first piece of children's literature written in Nova Scotia - possibly even Canada - titled <i>Little Grace or Scenes in Nova Scotia</i>. The sisters also are the main influence behind the construction of the first Anglican Church in Beaver Bank in 1886: the Church of the Good Shepherd. The original church was sold in 1998 to a private buyer and removed from its foundation.</p>
<p>Today it is located in the Township of Chester and used for private purposes. Frances Shunamon (McCarron, n&#xE9;e Grove) donated the land in her newly-developed "Shunamon Subdivision" to house the newer and current Church of the Good Shepherd, which still stands today.</p>
<p>The RCAF Station Beaver Bank was a long-range, Pinetree Line early warning radar station operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, located in Beaver Bank, or what is known by many as "the base". RCAF Station Beaver Bank was approximately 40 kilometres north of Halifax-Dartmouth. The station sat on 430 acres with about a half-mile separation between the domestic and the operations site, both sites being divided by the county line between Halifax County (the domestic site) and Hants County (the operations site).</p>
<p>The 22 Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was the operational unit posted to the station, its colours having been created in 1953 and the unit made operational a year later, in the Fall of 1954. The radar unit itself was manually operated and reported to the Fredericton NORAD Sector at RCAF Station St. Margarets until September 1962, when this was changed to the Bangor NORAD Sector at Topsham AFS, Maine.</p>
<p>The 22 AC&amp;W became SAGE-operational on January 1, 1964; however, this capability did not last long, as the station was closed and the squadron disbanded four months later, on April 1, 1964, following a NORAD realignment and increasing focus being placed on the DEW Line.</p>
<p>Royal Canadian Air Force Station Beaver Bank occupied a unique location and proximity to Canada's largest Atlantic seaport and its largest naval base, making it an important early warning radar base during the manual environment of the 1950s. Since manned bomber raids by the Soviet Union in the area were considered quite likely, it was felt that RCAF station Beaver Bank fulfilled a critical role in the early days of Canada's and North America's air defence.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the station was originally financed by the United States Air Force, although operational responsibility rested with the RCAF until 1962, when the RCAF assumed financial responsibility as well. In the mid-1970s the base was converted for a short time into a cement plant. This was used for only a few years before the base was abandoned completely.</p>
<p>In the 1950s residents of Beaver Bank had close access to the first Sackville drive-in theatre; a car race track, a drag strip called Drag City; Sackville Downs Raceway in the Downsview area; and Sackville Golf Course, a driving range and nine-hole, par-three course.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Beaver Bank is often misspelled as one word - Beaverbank - as it was misprinted on provincial signs for much of the 1980s and 1990s. After the community rallied together in protest for many years, the province reissued the signs with the correct spelling. There are still a few signs in the province that have not been corrected. As some early texts, such as newspapers, spelled Beaver Bank as one word, many of the older residents still consider that spelling to be correct.</p>
<p>Beaver Bank continues to grow exponentially. One of if not the oldest business still operating and employing people in the community is Barrett Lumber Limited. There is Chen's Variety Store on the Beaver Bank Road and restaurants such as Beaver Bank Pizza, located on the cross-section between Beaver Bank Road and Woodbine Avenue, and Foosing Chinese restaurant, located before the Beaver Bank Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are also two golf courses: Lost Creek Golf Club, a 19-hole championship golf course within a residential community, located in Lost Creek subdivision; and Emerson Ridge Driving Range, located across from Beaver Bank's well-known Brown Hall. Also, there are a few day care facilities in the community as well: First Memories Day Care, located on the Beaver Bank Road beside Woodbine Trailer Park homes; Peachtree Children's Centre located at 971 Wind Gate Drive, formerly known as the Windsor Junction Crossroad, located inside the Cross Roads Wesleyan Church, beside the Black Crow pub; Rachel's Day Care, a private, in-home day care located off Beaver Bank Road, on Majestic Avenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the riding of Sackville-Beaver Bank has developed through changes in many ways over the years, to have and continue to be dynamic communities that hold many future opportunities through a focused vision toward open-minded development. Our large land mass dictates development that is required by new and existing families. Also, the only thing that hinders this future development is economics.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the future of Sackville-Beaver Bank can be so much more than subdivisions and used car lots. The large land mass of Sackville-Beaver Bank dictates the fact that, as a community working together, we are the ones who choose our own destiny and together we can make out future a prosperous one.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank first my wife Leah for her growing support. In the beginning she was a bit uncertain about me becoming a politician. This direction was likened also to my decision to become a pastor. I want to thank my sons Alex and Jordan for their encouragement that was and still is very important to me. Alex was with us at caucus when we recognized Take Your Child to Work Day. He was very impressed with Premier McNeil and his new office.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Alex's friends Dewan White, Donovan White, Blake Henry, and Luke Eisner. I want to thank Marc Boutlier who got me to think about the possibilities that are a reality today. He was the one who, after witnessing me chair a meeting, asked: Did you ever think about getting into politics?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the now Premier of Nova Scotia, Stephen McNeil. I remember the first time that I met him in his office and as we were reaching out to shake hands something came to me and it was the memory of an old children's show that was on television, on CBC, many years ago and I've been trying to keep up with what we were beginning to say, the thing that came into my mind was look up, look way up, and I'll call Rusty. Well my name isn't Rusty, but I think Premier McNeil has all kinds of "Rustys" to work along with him in this new adventure that we are a part of.</p></speech>

          <p>Order, please. I'd just remind the honourable member not to use proper names in the Address in Reply, only to use titles.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#stephen.gough"><from>MR. GOUGH</from><p>I would like to also thank one of the other folks who helped me along the way; he was part of the chain that led us here today. I want to thank a good friend of mine, Regan Oliver, and his wife, Jennifer, who are continuing encouragers, who told me that everything that I have done in my life - and especially as a volunteer - has prepared me for this great opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Edward Downey and his wife, Angela, who were in total agreement when I asked what they thought about me throwing me hat into the political area - their reply was, why not?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the list could go on and on - my campaign manager Mr. Andrew McNeil and his wife, Nancy; Mr. Pearly Oliver as my official agent and his wife, Carol; Mr. Kirk Mitchel who volunteered at my campaign office after he returned home from work up North, he had seen my name on the sign and he had to find out if it was the old Steve that he knew from years ago in high school, and once he found out that it was me he asked: How can I help? My friends Warren Kelsey, Terry Kelsey, Darrell Kelsey; Mr. Derrick Keel and his wife, Claudette; Ms. Lori Watkins; John and Krista Alfred, and also their eight-year-old daughter, Emily, who is so excited about politics; and Ms. Sylvia Sinclair who is now my CA.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in recognizing these folks by name, I run the risk of possibly insulting someone by not mentioning them - all I can say is that they know who they are and I apologize if I haven't mentioned them by name. Know that I appreciate what you have done and that the faith that you have in me, whether I have mentioned you or not, you made our dream a reality. To have anyone put their faith and trust in you is a humbling reality, they are the ones who see something in you that we personally miss many times. To be an elected official creates many opportunities, they can be financial, social, and for sure is a great self-esteem builder but we must never become complacent towards the people we represent. (Applause)</p>
<p>There are people who have entrusted me to be their voice in this Legislature, who are really struggling - and I must insist on saying it again, there are a lot of people in our province very near to us who are struggling big time. It is easy to lose touch with people we represent if we lose touch, and I've told folks that if you recognize this attitude in me, let me know and I promise I will listen.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when I told my brother Kevin about delivering this speech as a response to the Throne Speech and that I had up to an hour to deliver it, he said: An hour, is that all they're willing to give you?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have had a long and diverse career, first as a transmission technician for over 36 years, a volunteer, a pastor, a concerned citizen who travelled to New York when they needed help, and to Haiti to lend a hand after a devastating earthquake. I have worked with youth in trying to mend relationships that were severed with parents and teachers and their peers.</p>
<p>I have worked in forestry, for that matter, sort of old school, with a horse. Not many people do it anymore, but what an experience - working in the forestry with a horse. I have done work that I have enjoyed when no one else wanted anything to do with it. It isn't work for me because almost everything interests me.</p>
<p>In the 1980s I was a DJ for a very popular cable radio show in Sackville, called the Funk Plaza, which ran for nine years. Frank Magazine got hold of that information from my bio on-line and used it in one of their issues. They called me the Funky Holy Man. In that issue their prayer was: please Lord, let the Funky Holy Man win. Well, I guess their prayers have been answered. If I am to be funky and if I am to be holy, then I want to be the best at it - funky and holy.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone for taking the time to catch a glimpse of who I am, what I have done, and what I plan to do as the voice of Sackville-Beaver Bank. Working together is when government works the best - Nova Scotia first. Thank you.</p></speech>
