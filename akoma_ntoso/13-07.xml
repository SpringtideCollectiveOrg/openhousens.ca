      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please.</p>
<p>Before we begin the daily routine, the subject for this evening's late debate was submitted by the honourable member for Hants West:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House recognize that Lyme disease is a growing issue in Nova Scotia and ask that the government take action.</p>
<p>This will be debated this evening at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>We will begin the daily routine.</p></speech>
      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. Before I start the daily routine, I'm obliged to do another Speaker's Ruling this morning.</p>
<p><b>SPEAKER'S RULING: </b>Remarks by Richmond MLA after the Speaker delivered a ruling (Hon. M. Samson, [Hansard p. 400, 04/04/13]) No point of order and no point of privilege.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after I delivered a ruling on a point of order, the honourable member for Richmond rose and made several remarks, asking me about what he said was a reversal by the Treasury Board of a decision that had been made by the House of Assembly Management Commission.</p>
<p>To be clear, as the honourable Government House Leader pointed out, it was not the Management Commission that made the initial decision in the matter but, rather, it was the Special Committee to Review the Estimates of the Auditor General and the Chief Electoral Officer, which is made up of the same people as those who are on the Management Commission, but is a separate committee of the House.</p>
<p>The member asked me a number of questions, including whether further recommendation respecting decisions of the committee would be honoured by the government. Without speculating on any of the questions posed to me by the member, I must point out that I cannot speak for the future or to anything that may be done by the government, or even by the committee of the House.</p>
<p>Turning to the procedural issues arising from the member's question, I reviewed Hansard and it is now clear that he did not rise on a point of order or a point of privilege. After my ruling on the point of order, he asked me a series of questions.</p>
<p>I remind all members of the rulings in 2010, by the previous occupant of this Chair, that it is out of order for the members to raise questions respecting the Speaker or matters falling under the administration of the Speaker in the House. If a member has questions about such things the member can raise them outside the House with the Speaker.</p>
<p>As set out in <i>Campion</i>, questions on such matters should be addressed to the Speaker by private notice - this includes matters relating to my involvement with committees of the House.</p>
<p>On another point, some of the member's questioning yesterday related to decisions of the Treasury Board. Those decisions have nothing to do with the Speaker and can be addressed more appropriately to the responsible minister, in a parliamentary manner. Further, it is not the role of the Speaker to rule on questions of law or statutory interpretation, which appear to me to be part of what he was asking.</p>
<p>The Speaker will not be drawn into debate in the House. What the member for Richmond asked was not a proper point of order or privilege. Members need to remember to follow proper procedure when raising things in the House. I've issued my ruling with respect to the previous point of order and have no intention of being dragged into a debate over the budget of the Office of the Auditor General.</p>
<p>Having taken this matter under advisement yesterday so I could carefully review Hansard as to what was raised by the member at that time, I rule there is no point of order or no point of privilege raised by the honourable member.</p>
<p>We will begin the daily routine.</p></speech>

<blockquote>"The road is in horrible condition and driving over a damaged road can hasten the wear and tear on your vehicle, increasing the costs of your vehicle's maintenance. Additionally, driving over a damaged road can be a jarring experience, particularly when you drive over a pothole unexpectedly. It was last paved 39 years ago and it is a definite safety concern for all residents who travel the road, including students who travel by bus daily!"</blockquote></speech>

<p>Whereas Nova Scotians are proud of their diverse culture and heritage and the contributions made by groups such as Scottish immigrants who have come to our province to build new lives and create a unique way of life that celebrates their language and culture; and</p>
<p>Whereas Scottish language and culture has shaped our heritage and strengthened the identity of our province over countless generations, and the links between Nova Scotia and Scotland continue to foster friendships and pride, exemplified by the visit to our province this week of Scotland's Minister of Transport and Veterans Affairs, Keith Brown, and a delegation from the Scottish Government; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Nova Scotia Tartan Act establishes April 6<sup>th</sup> as Tartan Day in Nova Scotia, and in 1987 Nova Scotia was the first province to celebrate Tartan Day, setting an example that is now followed throughout our country in recognition of the cultural significance of our Scottish heritage;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that members of the House of Assembly join me in recognizing April 6, 2013, as Tartan Day in Nova Scotia, in welcoming Scotland's Minister Brown and the delegation accompanying him to our province, and in wishing them continued success in promoting cultural ties among the Scottish diaspora throughout the world.</p>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>It's my pleasure to rise today to continue my reply to the Budget Speech that we heard yesterday here in the House. Just before beginning I would like to recognize, as well, the guests in the gallery that you mentioned, Mr. Speaker, and say that had I realized tomorrow was Tartan Day I would have worn some tartan today. I think you don't have to go very far in the history of most Nova Scotians to find somebody with a Scottish name. My mother was an Urquhart and her family, of course, was from Scotland originally in the 1800s. They had moved, actually, to St. Peter's area in West Bay in Cape Breton in the early 1800s, so we take great pride in that. I know that there are many people in this House who have names that are definitely identified as Scottish but we don't have to go many generations back to recognize that we are not far from our roots in this province. So I do think it is nice to have them here with us today. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the subject of my address today is not as pleasant as that. Today we're here to talk about the budget that was brought in yesterday, a budget that was touted as being balanced but there are a lot of people wondering and skeptical about the mechanisms and the means by which that budget was announced to be balanced. We know that across the country there were a few provinces that had done that and Nova Scotia is not the strongest of the economies in Canada. We don't have strong financial indicators and fundamentals at the moment. As much as we hope for the future and some of the big projects that may come to fruition in the province, we're still concerned that the budget that is presented should be a true reflection of the condition and the expectations of the coming year. That is what we expect.</p>
<p>I'd like to start, Mr. Speaker, by saying that the minister has mentioned on a number of occasions the Auditor General speaking and supporting what was given here and it's important for members to know that when the Auditor General makes a comment on the budget he is simply looking at the process by which the numbers were generated, that's all it is. (Interruptions) I'd like to read the letter.</p></speech>

Mr. Speaker, I was speaking to the Auditor General's opinion that he presents each year along with the budget and I do agree that in past years it was qualified, even under the first few years of the NDP. It was qualified because all of the corporations and DHAs, and so on, were not properly consolidated with the main budget and that has been done this year. That's the main reason there is no qualification on the revenue estimates. It's so that all of the bake sales and all of the money that comes in separately through school boards is all recognized in the budget. That's the reason.</p>
<p>So good decision, you have listened to the Auditor General and now, Mr. Speaker, the government has ruled that other information into the consolidated revenue (Interruptions)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, just in context, as I go back to the Auditor General and what the significance is of his letter in the Budget Estimates and what it really means, I think that a lot of members in the House often, in fact, don't have the financial background that might help them to understand a lot of these issues, whether or not something is qualified or not, what is the significance of it, and how much it means.</p>
<p>I know there are members in the House with financial backgrounds and I happen to be one of them. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I think it is a good time to mention the Society of Management Accountants that I've been a member of for many years. Since 1984 I've been a certified management accountant and I've worked as a consultant, so I always appreciate the opportunity to have the budget presented.</p>
<p>I know there is a lot of information, it is a lot of depth and you can get lost in the numbers, but it is a very important time to use our skills, whatever they may be, whether they are legal, whether they are financial, and apply that to what we see here today. I think with the letter from the Auditor General it's just important to know that the qualification that was given in the past was because it wasn't consolidated and that previous governments just sort of sloughed that off and said, well, this is the reason it's not so material.</p>
<p>It has now been addressed, that's good, but I think the members opposite really want me to read what the Auditor General said in his letter. I'm not sure if you'd like me to table it, Mr. Speaker, because everybody received a copy of this book yesterday. It's from the Budget Assumptions and Schedules. The Auditor General finishes with - the final paragraph says, "Since the 2013-14 revenue estimates are based on assumptions regarding future events, actual results will vary from the information presented and the variance may be material." It could be material. He is not saying that the estimates are really close to what we can expect and that barring any really outstanding, unusual thing that we won't make it, he's saying I'm not going to say, it could vary materially.</p>
<p>His final line is, "Accordingly I express no opinion as to whether the revenue estimates will be achieved." So that's really important. He's not saying everything in here is ironclad and it's going to happen and it's exactly accurate. It is an estimate. It's based on assumptions and the assumptions are provided by government. The assumptions are given to staff and the staff are told to apply those assumptions to get the best-looking budget, the most rosy, to extend, I guess, our credibility as far as you can, to get the best-looking budget possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General knows that and we know that. We know that the government wants to present a balanced budget because there was a promise made before the last election, by the current Premier, saying that there would be balanced budgets every year of the mandate of the NDP. This is the last budget we expect to see from the NDP in this term, hopefully for a long time to come. We are sure, and so is the public sure, that this is a pre-election budget, that a lot was at stake for the credibility and future of the NDP Government if they were to continue, so they wanted to make good on one promise, at least one year out of the four that they've been in power, that they would balance this budget.</p>
<p>Despite some very disappointing financial results over the last four years - and I acknowledge the government has weathered some very difficult times - the budget had to be balanced. It's an act of desperation on the part of the NDP to present a balanced budget going forward to the election and that's important to know.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I was referring to the fact that I have some background in accounting and I know that it's not an exact science; it's not a practice that says there's only one way to do things.</p>
<p>When we were being briefed yesterday, the financial staff was referring to different public sector accounting bulletins and guidelines and changes in how funds could be recognized. A lot of those - you can adopt them now, these are suggestions, you can do them later, but they give wiggle room and choices to government. I think that's important to note.</p>
<p>One of the things that has gone well in this year's budget is one new public accounting bulletin that said you now had to recognize funds in the month in which they apply. Anyway, $50 million got put back into the previous year's budget and added to last year's deficit and took $50 million out of this year by acknowledging payments in a different month than we had traditionally been doing it. So in 2012-13, 13 payments for Community Services' clients, 13 months were recognized last year and 11 months are going to be recognized this year.</p>
<p>That just shows the wiggle room that's available and that the government took advantage of. It is wiggle room, it's choices and that blew the budget deficit for last year. (Interruptions) Mr. Speaker, I don't think they want to learn too much more about what's behind the numbers here. It's important for the Opposition to do their work here and I think the rest of the House should be more respectful. May I continue? Good.</p>
<p>I'm a little bit annoyed today to hear the noise from the other side of the House because my job in Opposition is not to be a cheerleader for the NDP and I think they know that, that's obvious. My job is to use what I have. Their job is to be cheerleaders, and that's what they're doing, but you don't have to be disrespectful and noisy.</p>
<p>My job is to scrutinize the budget and to look carefully and to see whether things are as they appear, whether the numbers really do reflect what's true or whether they've been manipulated, or massaged, or in any way don't reflect the true picture of the future year coming. I see a number of things that I think are being pointed out and I think that the public need to know, as well. It presents a balanced view of the government's record and I think that's important. When the election comes, the government will have their chance to bring out their message and we will have our chance to point out our figures. That's important.</p>
<p>The balanced budget, as it was touted yesterday, really is based on a fiction and that's my job to point out. It would not be balanced if we had not moved those Community Services payments back by one full month, throwing them into the year before, and it wouldn't be balanced if we had not paid two of our universities in advance for their payments for the following year and that amount - those are two very basic things right off the bat. We definitely have two payments pushed back into the previous year.</p>
<p>In December 2012 we had our latest economic update and at that time we were told there was a $277 million deficit expected for the year just past, the one that we've just closed. Instead, yesterday we see the forecast is for a $356 million deficit. It has gone up by almost $80 million and that $80 million is accounted for by prepaying two of our universities, Acadia University and NSCAD, our art school, both prepaid for the year, and that pushed their recognition of the revenue into an earlier year. It's not the year it applies to and that's not directly associating the payments and the revenue in the right year.</p>
<p>Whether they asked for the money or not is not material, the cheque could be written on the 30<sup>th</sup> or it could be written on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April. If the money was promised, they would be happy. What they need to know is what their funding is, that's what they need to know to continue to operate. If they can't afford to operate, then the minister responsible for universities should be looking at that and working with them.</p>
<p>It's important that we recognize revenue in the year that it's received and that we recognize payments in the year that they are accounted for. So this is a manipulation and we know as well that the government condemned this very practice when they were in Opposition and that's important to put in the context.</p>
<p>If the government, if the Finance Critic of the day for the NDP - the current member for Halifax Fairview - if the current Premier had not condemned the former Tory Government for doing the same practice, then it wouldn't seem so hypocritical, but the fact is that the history is there, that it was condemned roundly when it was tried in the past and the Premier himself, Madam Speaker, called that budget a "fudge-it budget." Now twice, in the current government, the NDP have used that same mechanism.</p>
<p>As I said, what we're seeing then is $80 million extra on our deficit for last year, which was already a write-off - right? The government had already failed to reach their balanced budget last year, so just throw $80 million more in last year's deficit and try like mad to show and reflect a positive picture for this year.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, as I said, this is a pre-election budget and we know darn well that it's heading towards an election, that it's more of an election document than it is a budget and that everything has been constructed to form a narrative that's going to be positive on the election trail, on the campaign trail. That's what this is for, so I think we have to look at it with that lens.</p>
<p>A lot of the media and on-line comments are also recognizing that this was trying to pull that rabbit out of the hat and create, by one means or another, the impression of a balanced budget. So right away, if we take the university prepayment out of last year and put it in this year, where it belongs, right away we would have a deficit this year of $18 million rather than a $16 million surplus. So it's that thin, that that one prepayment has pulled the rabbit through the hat, if you like, and all of a sudden you have a conjuring trick.</p>
<p>People just need to know that, that this is what it's based on, what the foundation of the budget is - so even if we accept that it would be balanced and that the figures are true, the $16 million surplus, Madam Speaker, is so thin that any number of very tiny machinations will throw that out of whack.</p>
<p>We know that by the first quarter results, when they come in, we're not going to be seeing as rosy a picture. That's why I believe and I'm prepared to say today that I think the government has to go to an election before the first quarter results are out, because that's going to then reveal how thin this budget is and really how unpredictable and unreliable the figures are before us. That's important to note because a lot is now based on the narrative or the fiction or the fairy tale that was the Budget Speech yesterday - and that's very important to know.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, as I said, there are choices that people can make within accounting guidelines. You can still get the Auditor General to say yes, you followed guidelines; yes, you followed a process and set some assumptions and have been true to those assumptions. That doesn't mean that those assumptions are realistic; it doesn't mean that they're likely to come to pass, and that is why the Auditor General said he would not say, he absolutely, categorically would not say that he thought they would come to pass. He has no confidence in saying so, and that's very important for all of us.</p>
<p>The ChronicleHerald today actually had a comment on the $50 million that went in for the early payment and it's in the editorial today. It says "A required change in accounting for advanced transfer payments (for example when government sends April income assistance cheques out in the last days of March) has added an extra month of payments to 2012-13 fiscal year and subtracted a month from 2013-14. This removes $50 million from 2013-14 expenses, a nice lift from the accounting standards gods." That shows that it was really outside of good management - perhaps it was a gift that the accounting rules changed this year. Madam Speaker, I'd be happy to table that as well.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, Madam Speaker, there's a rule change and it's your choice when you adopt it. There were rule changes to adopt GAAP long before the government moved towards Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in public accounting. So there are choices made by government every year. This one was helpful; this one looked good on the books. So, okay, I understand if it was in the favour of the government, I guess that was the choice made.</p>
<p>The university prepayment, however, that's another matter, Madam Speaker. I still call into question the veracity of the balanced budget, this razor-thin surplus which is not really there if you properly identify the payments to universities. That's what I'm saying, that was a practice condemned by the government and now embraced twice in their term - twice - not once but twice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read the article, and tabled it, where in 2009 The ChronicleHerald editorial had said that that was a huge hit to the credibility of the current government. Huge hit, they said it was a bus-sized hit and that has already been tabled twice in the last two days so I think that the Clerk will agree I don't need to table it again. Madam Speaker, plain and simple, the numbers tell us what the situation is and it's up to the opposition members to see where those numbers have been conjured up, how they've come to be, and whether or not they are reasonable and the assumptions are reasonable.</p>
<p>A second area, in addition to the prepayments of cost, a second area that is very important to note is the inflated revenue estimates for the coming year. The budget does include, I think, an outrageous - maybe prosperously silly would be the right word - expectation that our economy will turn around so dramatically that we'll have over 7 per cent higher personal income tax coming into the province, corporate income tax is going to rise, HST is going to rise; everything is going to be so buoyant. But, Madam Speaker, if you look at the major projects we're hoping to see materialize in the province, they are not due to come on stream in 20013-14. The shipbuilding one is the most touted here in the House and in our province and we know that there is going to be a lot of benefit come from that and it is a very large public sector project. It will have good benefits to the public sector, the Irving shipbuilding project, but it's not even going to actually begin work on the ships until the year after 2015. So where does that leave us next year for suddenly conjuring up hundreds of millions of dollars in extra money?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, prior to the budget coming down, there was a lot of speculation about how the government could turn around a $300 million deficit, that there was $300 million in spending last year that they would have to overcome, find ways to cut that out and get ahead to the next year even to come in on par. We didn't know how that would be done and now it is quite obvious, it has been done by really inflating the revenue figures by having huge expectations about the economy of Nova Scotia for next year.</p>
<p>Again, as much as we'd love to see that in every corner of the province, to see the really dismal unemployment numbers improve, if we'd like to stop the halt of Nova Scotians heading out west for jobs that are waiting for them and higher pay - we know in our own families, and I know many people in the House have family who have gone out there to either train or to get work, a lot of young people are leaving and that is a sad thing. Not even just young people, midcareer people that have lost their jobs in our province have left. That's just a reality of our situation today, we're not at the point yet where we're able to bring them back and draw them back into these big projects.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, another project that has been touted by the minister was the Muskrat Falls project but that's not going to create tremendous employment here in this province. We know that. Even if the project goes forward, where is the employment? We have the landfall here in Halifax for all the Internet cables to Europe and that was touted as a great big thing when the landfall came and we have all this Internet connection, but that means nothing when you actually get down to jobs. It is just a pipeline and that is what is going to be coming this way, a pipeline. It's just the jobs are not there.</p>
<p>I also want to go back to the Budget Assumptions and Schedules to just have a quick look at what the government's information - the economic information, the outlook for the coming years is all included in the Budget Assumptions and Schedules. There are all kinds of charts and bar charts; it's about our population growth or not. Madam Speaker, we could start with population itself and in that regard we've had, at best, a pretty stable population. It's not growing. Our birth rate has been quite low. In 2006, in that one year anyway, we had more deaths than we had births. We are trying to encourage immigration so that we can bolster our numbers and keep our people employed and keep economic activity here, but it does require a population, and a young population, to improve spending and growth.</p>
<p>If we're all retired people, we won't be buying the items that are going to feed this HST line. Where do we get the HST revenue? We get it from people buying homes, buying cars, and buying furniture. Young people are doing that when they're setting up their lives. Older people are settled, they're not buying all these things that are going to add to the HST bottom line. So we have to look at our population and say where are we going? What's the economic trend and are we likely to see a big boom this coming year in income, in employment, in perhaps the number of people here in the province who are buying and consuming goods and services. Madam Speaker, nowhere in the Budget Assumptions do I see anything that would give me the confidence to know where the government conjured up a 7 per cent increase in our own income here in the province.</p>
<p>The government's budget estimates show personal income tax going up by over $140 million, a big bump in corporate tax as well, over $60-some million and another large $60 million to $70 million in HST increases. This is in a year when we didn't meet our budget for last year. In fact, all of that fell off in this last year of 2012-13. All of that was below, that's why the budget update in December 2012 showed us going from a $211 million deficit to $277 million. A lot of that was a decrease in corporate and personal income tax. So we've had a year where we didn't meet our targets and next year we think it's going to rise by 7 per cent. It's not realistic, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>I wanted to look particularly at the unemployment. Yesterday I had a chance to ask the Minister of Finance a question in Question Period about this and I'll grant you, her answer was that she had consulted with many experts, that they had talked to many economists and gone around Canada to test their assumptions. But, Madam Speaker, it flies in the face of common sense to explain to me that we're going to have more people working, higher incomes, more money coming back to the province in income tax and corporate tax, when we're still predicting a 9 per cent - in fact, for the coming year 9.1 per cent - unemployment rate in the province. In the next year, 2014, it rises to 9.2 per cent, there's no change there.</p>
<p>We know the trends, as I said, about the number of people leaving the province. Madam Speaker, we know that 6,400 fewer people are working in this province than did a year ago. That's a huge number, 6,400 Nova Scotians in a little province of less than one million people. We know that every month 1,000 people are turning 65 and joining the ranks of seniors. That means we know our workforce, our working age population is shrinking.</p>
<p>Now yesterday the minister said that even seniors are making more money. I wonder if many seniors are going back to work in the part-time-work economy that we have at the moment. Part-time work has grown; maybe it's the seniors who are being forced back to work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it doesn't really support the government in their assumption that we're going to have a huge increase in income tax. That's the point I want to make, that the assumptions in this budget document don't support an inflated, overly-buoyant and, in fact, miraculous recovery in income tax. It's just not going to come back to us and that's our number-one source of our own income in the province, from personal income tax. If you go through the whole list, there is just that one item that is the largest. Corporate income tax pales by comparison; it's not even one-quarter of personal income tax. So the most important thing the government can do is grow new jobs, have higher paying jobs in this province, grow the economy.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister loves to talk about a three-legged stool, I guess was her example to the chamber of commerce. One of those legs of the stool is growing the economy and that is where the government has really failed. There has been a complete failure in expanding our economy in the last four years.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think there have been some desperate attempts to do so. I think the government has been quick to jump on any suggestion that comes to their door, any unsolicited proposals like IBM saying, we'll come in and set up a call centre or a big centre of some sort but you have to give us your $8.5 million a year contract, you have to give us all your people, you have to forgo all of the time, effort, millions, multi-million dollar efforts that we had to develop that system in-house.</p>
<p>I've sat here, Madam Speaker, for 10 years and I've often been on the Public Accounts Committee. Annually we've seen different projects along the SAP line about how they were introducing another segment of that. Each time it was $30 million and $40 million and $50 million development projects. All that expertise goes out the door with IBM and the staff that we may be losing in that transfer. If they don't get our staff, the expertise is not going to be there. I do believe they're getting quite a few of the staff at the end of the day, though, I will say. But if they didn't, the risk is that they wouldn't be able to do the work we've been doing in-house.</p>
<p>To add to that, Madam Speaker, when have you ever heard of the government outsourcing jobs and having it be revenue-neutral? Usually you outsource jobs because you want to cut costs, to do that fiscal restraint that the government has also talked about, but we don't see evidence in the budget. But, anyway, out go the jobs, and we've lost the expertise, and we closed the door on our own SAP functions, and - who knows? - we might have to pick it up again in 10 years, because this contract is only 10 years and then IBM can choose to leave. But we didn't ask for this proposal; it was brought to us, and my concern is did the government do due diligence, did they look at options, did they really consider this? That's no way to grow the economy, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the whole idea of corporate largesse - or let's call it really what the government would have called it in Opposition, "corporate welfare" - has really gone out of control in the last couple of years, far beyond anything we had seen under the 10 years of Progressive Conservative Governments. And it's really, really interesting that it's an NDP Government, Madam Speaker, that has gone so blindly into a lot of agreements with companies, and I think it just shows that there has been a desperation to try to show some positive aspects.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, my concern is that we've opened a chequebook, and that corporate welfare is becoming a way of life here in Nova Scotia - and it's not right. Small business is left out, regular mom and pop businesses in our communities get no government assistance - no help whatsoever - and I think that the emphasis has been in the wrong place.</p>

<p>As well, I wanted to say that there are good things in this budget, like the insulin pumps. We in the Liberal caucus have been asking for that policy to change for many years. Even previous to this government, we had bills before the Legislature. The Progressive Conservative Government had the opportunity to do so and did nothing. They turned a blind eye when they were asked again and again by the Juvenile Diabetes Association, by the Liberal caucus, by other advocates, and by families, and finally this is going to become a reality in Nova Scotia, so we're very pleased. We don't expect our bill to be passed. We're very pleased that the actual intent of it is now going to become reality. We hope that over time that will be expanded to adults as well, because it has better outcomes for all those patients.</p>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>That is good news. I don't know if I have 10 minutes of praise for this budget. I had actually planned just a couple of minutes of praise. There are definitely measures in this budget that are good for people in Nova Scotia, and things that we've asked for - I know there are things that we have individually spoken to ministers about.</p>
<p>I have to say, it points to this being the budget for the election year. The government has had to hold back on some of these things and waited to put it in this budget, in their final year, so that now they would hope that the most recent budget will be what's in everybody's minds. These goodies, these responses to needs, are going to be the things that they can run on in the next election.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it the Liberal caucus supports those measures. They're good for people, and we will of course be supportive on those aspects of the budget. There's no question that it was time to do the insulin pumps, in particular, and I know there are a number of other small tax measures.</p>
<p>One of the quotes that we had here related to the fact that it's time for a comprehensive tax review. We have been calling for that, as you know, for some time, that the government needs to take a step back and look at all of the costs that we have and how we're going to manage it. I can't quite find my quote here, but I know that in the paper today somebody is calling for a proper review of all the taxes. What we've been seeing and what has continued over many years is a piecemeal approach to a little bit of tweaking on this one or that one or adding a little credit somewhere. It doesn't amount to doing the kind of tax study that would say what taxes could we change that will most stimulate the economy? What taxes might help people to get ahead in their own lives or help small business?</p>
<p>We're not looking at the overall impact of all of our taxes, and at the end of the day you could collect the same amount of taxes but do it in a different way, and it might have a far more beneficial effect on the economy. That's what we have been promoting for many years, that there be a comprehensive tax review so that we can talk to business and to individuals and to poverty advocates and see what will work best to make life more affordable and a little bit easier for people in Nova Scotia, and to still create the economic growth we want.</p>
<p>Again, Madam Speaker, where are we getting this economic forecast that says we will suddenly increase our own income, our Nova Scotia-grown income by over, roughly, $250 million? It's just not realistic and I wish it were, but it's not. It's my job in Opposition to say these figures don't add up, the numbers don't add up, the assumptions don't support what we see in the revenue estimates, that's it, they're not there.</p>
<p>At the same time, I know that Nova Scotians can read this, too, and they know what's going on in their lives and they know the rate of unemployment and they know whether their children are still home, living at home, because they can't get a decent job that will allow them to move out and make their own lives. We know the unemployment rate right now is 10.4 per cent in Annapolis; 12.2 in southern Nova Scotia; 12.5 in the North Shore; 17 per cent in Cape Breton today; and 18.5 per cent unemployment for youth in Nova Scotia. Imagine that, Madam Speaker, and I know that both of us have children about the same age, 18.5 per cent unemployment for our youth 18 to 24. That's a reality for many parents. We know that as we try to help our children and see what's next in their lives.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of promises made by the government since, well particularly pre-election promises last time. Go back to 1999, Madam Speaker, and at that time during the election there was a televised debate of Leaders and the Leaders were asked: will you raise taxes in your coming term if you are elected? The current Premier, then-Leader of the NDP, said oh absolutely no raised taxes. Are you going to balance the budget? Absolutely. Those are the easy answers. The Leader of the Liberal Party didn't say that, the Leader of the Liberal Party said we don't know the state of the books, we haven't had that opportunity, we haven't had that chance, we know that we need to be a little bit more cautious in making those kinds of blatant promises. Our Leader was the only Leader that showed honesty and credibility in that debate. (Applause)</p>
<p>Nova Scotians remember that and Nova Scotians know who told the truth in that debate and that's going to come back to roost with this government. The promise to balance the budget every year has not been achieved, this is the first balanced budget and we've just proven that this budget is based on a stack of cards, it doesn't have a foundation that is solid, and the assumptions are not bearing out what's in the numbers. We've seen that. I can go on about the economic forecast if the members want. There is a lot more to say about where we are in terms of numbers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the net debt has been rising every year that the NDP have been in power - we haven't talked about that yet, but I have a few more minutes and I think it's important that we look at that. The net debt is over a billion dollars higher than it was, I think it's $1.4 billion higher than when the government came into power four years ago. That is a huge thing, that's more than 10 per cent now of our total deficit accounted for in the last four years and the NDP love to point out that the two Parties here on this side of the House have been the only governing Parties since our province was founded and in all that time there was a debt, a debt was accumulated, but 10 per cent of the debt now is the responsibility of the NDP Government in just four years, and that's a shameful thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the pace at which this debt has risen is astounding; if we have another four years of NDP Government, God knows where it will go. It's growing by a tremendous amount and we know that more and more is being just pushed into debt, all of the capital spending, everything is going into debt. We want to see a plan. Some kind of plan needs to be in place to address debt in the coming years. We just can't blindly go into the future and the government should remember while they are touting the Auditor General's letter in today's budget, they should remember the Auditor General's strong condemnation of the debt; that was unequivocal. There was a strong condemnation of where we are.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that the four years of the NDP Government have been characterized by corporate welfare - really, fewer people working. If you took the collective workforce of the companies that we've put $600 million into, we have fewer people working. We have never seen a government pump money in to have fewer jobs after they made that contribution, so what's going on in this corporate welfare? Who's in charge of these deals?</p>
<p>That corporate welfare has been a characterization of this government - broken promises from the HST increase when there was a promise of no tax increases, from the promise of emergency rooms being open 24/7 to totally changing the definition of an emergency room and what that was all about. Nova Scotians know that's just semantics. They know the emergency rooms were still closed 17,000 hours last year. They know that even where there are new CECs, some of them are closing. I heard Springhill was closed because no doctor was available, so that's happening even under the new model of community care: 17,000 hours in one year. Those are broken promises.</p>
<p>I think it's important that we look at the characterization of the NDP term in office: the characterization this year of inflating revenue beyond what would be recognized by any economist or accountant and by prepaying a number of costs to inflate last year's deficit and make this year look a lot rosier than it ever would have been if we had a true representation. The confidence, the reliability, the transparency, and the trustworthiness of this government are in question, and I believe that Nova Scotians will be looking at this budget. They'll look at it with a lot of scrutiny, with great care, and they will see what we see: that it doesn't bear fruit, that their biggest concern is unemployment, and yet the people in government think that we're going to have an unbelievably buoyant year. These forecasts are not realistic, and they call into question the credibility of the budget itself.</p>
<p>We look forward to the 40 hours that we will have here in the Chamber and the 40 hours in the Red Room to try to drill down more on these numbers and get greater accountability from the Government of the NDP. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to begin by saying that I really appreciate the remarks of the speaker who just concluded, the Finance Critic for the Liberal Party. I believe she did a very thorough job of discrediting the claim of balance in her normal professional manner. I know she has some background in these things, and I just want to compliment her on a job well done here this morning. It's good to see someone in Opposition who does have a grasp of the finances of the province.</p>
<p>Her Leader, of course, made a big deal in the last election about the fact that he didn't know the state of the province's finances - an odd thing to say, for someone who at that time had been the Leader of his Party for over two years, going into an election campaign. Of course, trying to make a virtue out of not understanding the finances did not stop the Leader of the Liberal Party in the last election from making $530 million in spending promises, even though he didn't know the state of the province. I have a document from that campaign to table in a few minutes.</p>
<p>What could be more responsible than standing up in this House, having been in Opposition for several years, and saying, I don't know the state of the books - like he did, trying to make a virtue of not knowing - and then going ahead and promising $530 million in spending anyway. That is what is wrong with people who criticize all the time but have nothing positive to say themselves. But I got up to compliment the Finance Critic who just spoke, because at least she did a thorough job of showing her own understanding of the flimflammery that we see on the government side today.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do want to turn to the NDP's budget, because much has been made of the fiction of the razor-thin $16 million alleged surplus that the NDP tabled yesterday. The fact that it is so far off can actually be seen in the series of reports they gave on their real, truthful progress - or lack of progress - in the year just ended. Last year's budget estimated a deficit of $211 million, and we found out yesterday - and this hasn't been thoroughly covered yet, I don't believe - that they were off by $145 million on their $211 million deficit for the year that just ended. How can Nova Scotians believe anything they say now, when they were off by so much on the actual results of the year that they just finished with?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the great humour in all this is one of the reasons that they were so far off is that they didn't reach their extreme revenue assumptions, their inflated goals for tax income, for sales tax, they didn't meet them. All through the year 2012-13 the NDP said we're falling short because our tax revenues are below our expectations. Yet what did they turn to, yesterday, to try and show the people of Nova Scotia that they were going to be balanced this time? An inflated view of how much they were going to take in in income tax and sales tax and corporate tax, yet again.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I can't help but point, over and over again, to that famous cartoon of Charlie Brown and Lucy where every season Lucy tries to convince Charlie Brown to kick the football. Charlie Brown knows she's going to pull it away at the last second and he's going to fall flat on his back but he can't help himself but go in and try to kick that football one more time. That is exactly the NDP method of budgeting because year after year they produced these hocus-pocus budgets and only after the fact, only after they yanked the football away and Nova Scotians fall flat on their backs, do we find out the truth, that there was no balance at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there's something else very interesting, though, about our experience with the NDP when it comes to actually meeting their own budget targets. Not only are they using the same trickery this time as they used last year but in their most recent update, just three short months ago, they told us okay, we're not going to hit our $211 million deficit target, it's now $277 million, but that's the real number. That's what the NDP told the people of Nova Scotia just three short months ago.</p>
<p>What did we find out yesterday? Yesterday we found out that it is not $277 million anymore, it is $356 million. Now that's a very interesting number, Mr. Speaker, because somehow in the last three months they slid by another $79 million, close to $80 million. Now what happened in the last three months to throw the NDP off by another $80 million in their actual results? Well I think we found out yesterday, in fact I know we found out yesterday, and all Nova Scotians are now seeing the truth about what happened. It didn't happen in the third month, it didn't even happen in the second month, it happened at the very end of last month that they took a bunch of spending that more properly belongs in the budget and they stuffed it back into last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday Nova Scotians turned their attention to the issue of prepaying two of our universities, a bad accounting practice from the past that deserves to stay in the past, a practice that the NDP themselves criticized in Opposition when they saw it, a practice that bears no resemblance to the real world of how monies should be allocated and accounted for, a practice designed only to make one year look worse and the new year look better. That is why it belongs in the past. That is why the government's own consultants, Deloitte, a world-wide, respected accounting firm, told them that that practice should stop.</p>
<p>The government waves that Deloitte report around every chance they get, when it works in their favour, but they stay strangely silent on it when they don't like what it says. Mr. Speaker, Deloitte said don't do that anymore, when it comes to prepaying the universities, but the government did just that so $35 million of that $80 million slippage from last year can be completely accounted for by taking two of our universities - Acadia and NSCAD - and giving them their entire next year's amount of money in the year just ended.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, the government has tried to say that that's perfectly normal because they wanted the money, it would help them out. Well the fallacy of that argument can be seen in the fact that - do you know what date they gave them the money? Do you know what day that money went from the province to those universities? It was March 28<sup>th</sup>, three days before the year end of both the government and those universities - three days. How much help does that give to those two universities that they got their money three days before year end, in fact the very last business day of the previous year? It was of no significant help to Acadia or NSCAD.</p>
<p>The only beneficiary of that last-minute March madness transaction was a desperate NDP Government doing everything they could to stuff money into last year to try to create the fiction of a surplus. That is what is wrong with this government. (Interruptions) That is what is wrong with this government.</p>
<p>When those universities said they needed help, the NDP had a choice. Even if you accept the argument that they needed help, they had a choice. Do we send the money at the proper time and in the proper year, which is three days later than they did, and be truthful about whether the budget was balanced or not, or do they rush it to the universities at the last minute, no benefit to them, only so they could create the fiction of a balanced budget? Common sense, everyday Nova Scotians know the answer to that question - it was done not for the universities, it was done only for the government using the same old tricks, the tricks that were part of the past and belong in the past and that is what &#x2026;</p></speech>

            <p>Order. Order please. The same as yesterday, again today, "tricks" and "trickery" are unparliamentary and I would remind the honourable member that I mentioned it yesterday, and I'll mention it again today. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you for that ruling, and I understand.</p>
<p>My point is, Mr. Speaker, when you claim a surplus of $16 million, when you claim one and we can already in one moment prove that it's not a surplus but actually a deficit, from this one move it just undermines further the credibility of the government as a whole, a government that said they would not do these things when they were in Opposition, that accepted a report from world-class accountants saying not to do these things and then turned around and did these exact things.</p>
<p>I pointed out a moment ago that in the last three months the government's year they just finished got $80 million worse and $35 million is because they stuffed the university money in there - but, as we found out yesterday, that's not all the year-end manoeuvering that they did because it turns out there's another $50 million in year-end transactions that the government engaged in to take money that properly belonged in the budget and stuff it back into last year. Now, $50 million and $35 million - $85 million explains the entire difference between their last fiscal update for last year and what they told the people of Nova Scotia yesterday.</p>
<p>So when any Nova Scotian looks at this budget and that $16 million alleged surplus, the proof that it's wrong can be found just by looking at the year that just finished and how far off it was from what they said. I know that the government in their presentation in the lock-up yesterday to the media, to the public, went through all the accounting changes that they adopted this year - and in four of the five cases in that presentation they went out of their way to report the net impact on the bottom line in the budget. In four of the five accounting changes they made, they said there is no impact, but on the fifth change, which they did tell us about, they were silent on the net impact.</p>
<p>How interesting that is, because it is the one that is the smoking gun of accounting changes in this budget. They kept it to themselves that it actually had a $50 million impact on the budget bottom line. That is transfers to individuals made in the last week of March, like income assistance payments from Community Services that they made at the end of March 2013 and stuffed into the actual results for 2013, even though they were late to payments for April 2013, which is the new start of the budget year.</p>
<p>Although that is an accounting change, Mr. Speaker, the least we could expect from the government that wanted to be open and transparent is that they tell people what they've done and show the budget under both sets of rules. This is exactly what I was worried about all along. It is why I tabled a bill in this House saying that if you change the accounting rules and it has a bottom-line impact on the budget, you have to tell the people of Nova Scotia and show it under both sets of rules.</p>
<p>Did they do that? No. They changed the rules. They recovered $50 million that they could make their budget look better with, and they didn't tell people the effect. So $35 million for universities and $50 million in transfers at the end of March - that's the reason that last year looked so much worse, and the reason that this surplus cannot be trusted. That is the record of the NDP, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>If that were not enough for Nova Scotians to throw the budget out as a work of fiction, as they surely will do the more they learn about it, then knowing that on the expense side, the government is already counting savings that they haven't actually accomplished yet, in an amount more than the alleged surplus itself - when the government actually records $18 million in savings from ideas like better purchasing and more shared services, before they even realize that savings, they are literally counting their chickens before they hatch.</p>
<p>Nowhere else would someone say they've saved the money before they've actually saved it. Nowhere else would someone say, well, I have that money now because I thought of a good idea about saving it. They estimate it when they actually have a savings to estimate, not before. This is the kind of accounting flimflammery that happens in too many governments across the country and around the world, and they have gone ahead and done the same thing. So there are three ways - each, on their own, greater than the alleged surplus itself - that throw this budget from surplus into real deficit.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Speaker, perhaps the biggest one of all is the idea that somehow, after three years of economic hardship, after three years of job losses - 6,700 in the last year alone - after three years of Nova Scotians experiencing virtually no growth in their wages or their incomes - the seventh-worst performance of income growth in the country, as I tabled yesterday - after three years of a stalled economy - an economy in outright recession outside Halifax - the NDP suddenly believe that our jobs are going to take off and our incomes are going to take off as of April 1, 2013.</p>
<p>Now, nobody believes that on March 31<sup>st</sup> we have economic hardship and then we have a budget on April 1<sup>st</sup> of the new year, and all of a sudden the sun comes up, our incomes skyrocket, and the government tax revenues grow by over $290 million, almost $300 million. This is the kind of magic accounting that Nova Scotians saw in the budget yesterday.</p>
<p>I'll tell you, Enron has nothing on these guys. A company that went down because they engaged in these kinds of accounting practices, a company that went down because of this kind of attempt to create a fictional bottom line, and you know what, Mr. Speaker? I hear them yelling, well, the Auditor General says it's okay. Enron had an auditor too. There are ways, as we have learned too often in the accounting scandals of companies like Enron. That is why Nova Scotians want a government here that doesn't engage in those kinds of practices, that doesn't create such a fiction, that doesn't present to the people a budget that is so obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Like anyone else who has a problem, the first step in getting control of the finances of our province is to present open and honest and accurate estimates before the House and a budget before the people that truthfully reflects the financial position of the province. Only then can Nova Scotia ever begin to move ahead. When the NDP came in, they said that was what they were going to do; in fact, they said they were going to do it in their very first year and they were going to do it every year. This is their fourth year and their fifth budget and we haven't seen it yet and we certainly don't see it now.</p>
<p>Those are some of the reasons and there are many more about why. I say that because Nova Scotia has a very bad history spanning back over many years, and I can say here, as a new Leader, over all Parties, that when the pressure is on, when election time comes, this House and the people of this province have seen too much of this kind of accounting game being played to try to create on paper what they can't do in reality. Nova Scotia will not move ahead until all of those practices are behind us.</p>
<p>Just last year they knowingly gave Nova Scotians a budget with a $27 million hole in it. The last time the Liberals were in they presented a balanced budget on the eve of an election; it turns out they didn't count $600 million, 20 times as much in new debt. This province deserves better than both of those examples. There have been examples from all sides, in fairness, from all sides, and they're wrong and they deserve to be in the past. When Nova Scotians voted for change, they thought they were putting it in the past, but it turns out they got it in spades, again, this time from the NDP. That is why, like the Liberals, they are the Party of the past and yesterday's budget shows it once again.</p>
<p>Even if we take the government's tax estimates at face value, which is a big stretch, it means another $300 million coming out of the pockets of everyday Nova Scotians; that is over $300 each. Even if we take them at their word that they're really going to take that much more in tax money from us, that is more than $300 each. What kind of plan is truly balanced when its basic premise is that they're going to reach into our jeans for another $300 a person? That is not sustainable. That is not fair to the people of Nova Scotia. That is not a plan for the economy, or for families, or to make life better; it's a plan to further impoverish the hard-working people of this province. That is no way to build a modern, dynamic, growing economy; in fact, the opposite is what is needed to grow a modern economy and that is to give people a break on their taxes and fees, not to further squeeze them - $300 each.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians might be willing to go along if they saw any kind of restraint from the government itself, but they don't see that in this budget. For every $3 that the NDP is going to grab out of our pockets this year, they are only looking to themselves to kick in $1 in alleged savings. We give $3; they try to find $1. That is not fair. That is not balanced. No household out there is going to say, I get to give $3 more in taxes and fees and the government tries to find $1. That's not matched. That's not fair. That's not balanced. In fact, the only way to truly balance the budget and get on with building a modern, growing economy is to do the opposite of what the NDP are doing, and that is to first find those free dollars in savings from the government before you ask the people for more; that would be a more proper ratio.</p>
<p>Are they doing that? No. Do they accept all the wasteful government spending that continues to go on? Yes. Are there still 10 district health authorities and 10 CEOs and dozens of vice-presidents and thousands of managers that they are paying for? Oh, yes, there are. Are there still hundreds of millions of dollars in forgivable loans and corporate bailouts in the budget? Oh, yes, there is. Are they still paying for Tim Hortons in our hospitals and subsidizing them? Yes, they are.</p>
<p>All of that stays; they chose to keep that and, instead, tell Nova Scotians that they're going to take $300 each from us to try to make the books look good, and that is not good enough.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the reason that our economy here in this province lags so far behind the growth that we see in the rest of Canada is because we're already paying the highest taxes and the highest fees and the highest power rates, and Nova Scotians have had enough; they are tapped out. When you tap out the people of the province, the economy cannot grow; in fact; it shrinks.</p>
<p>Here we have a budget that not only has no plan for jobs or for the economy, it doesn't even foresee any growth in jobs or the economy in the future. The government's own budget assumptions show the level of employment going nowhere for the next few years; it shows the labour force going nowhere for the next few years. Mr. Speaker, that's what they are admitting to.</p>
<p>The reason it shows that is because they have tapped out the typical Nova Scotian family, they have reached into their pockets already for $1,000 in extra HST; they have reached into their pockets already for 30 per cent more on their power bills; and they have reached into their pockets already for another $12 million in user fees for government services. They have no limit to how far they're willing to go when they reach into our pockets because, on top of that, they want $300 more from each and every one of us in the new budget while they try to find $1 to match the $3 that we're giving up. That is backwards economics; that is backwards budgeting. That is not balanced budgeting; that is unfair, unjust, wrong-headed budgeting and planning, and that's why Nova Scotians are stressed and that's why the economy is in such trouble here while it grows in the rest of Canada. That's what's wrong with what they are doing.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, let me just pause for a moment and say that in the middle of all that gloom there was a nice, small but important ray of sunshine for young Nova Scotians suffering from diabetes who are in need of an insulin pump to make their life a little better. I do want to put on the record that we agree that the time has long come and we finally see it, where the government is going to invest in insulin pumps for our youngest Nova Scotians who suffer from diabetes and can benefit from one. That is an important investment that will pay off over and over again for those young people and even for government health care spending itself in the years ahead. That's exactly why we've been calling on the government to do that for a long time - and I will say that so have the Liberals. Both Opposition Parties have been calling on the government to do the right thing on insulin pumps for a long time.</p>
<p>Now where we are different, Madam Speaker, is that unlike the Liberals who call on them to spend more money, but have no idea where that money will come from, we actually took that call a step further and pointed out to the government where they could find the money to pay for those insulin pumps, where in their own budget they could save the money to buy insulin pumps - and it is to stop the crazy subsidy of Tim Hortons outlets in our hospitals, because that saving alone covers the expense of those insulin pumps.</p>
<p>I'm glad that they are now funding the insulin pumps. I am disappointed that rather than save the money to do it, they just spent it without any idea of how to save the money, but at least we gave them both the idea and how to pay for it - and that's what Nova Scotians want from a modern, growing, dynamic, political Party that wants to run the province. What would you spend your money on, what would your priorities be, and where would you find the money, and we're meeting that test. That's important because it's different from the Liberals who have yet, after seven years under the current Leader, to meet that test even once, but we are meeting that test right now. I hope the government actually does take up both the suggestion to fund those insulin pumps and stop the subsidy to those Tim Hortons so that they can actually find the money too, and that would be a great thing. The same is true for victims of CF. Madam Speaker, I also agree with the funding that is going to be providing for screening for cystic fibrosis; that is an important addition to the health care services of the province and I do support it and that's a good one.</p>
<p>I also, Madam Speaker, while I'm up, on the theme of good things, am happy to see that more of our seniors will be relieved of some of the burden of income tax and property tax, particularly low-income seniors, particularly low-income seniors that want to stay in their own homes, to give them a little break is a good thing. Now having said that, it is another example of how the government gives to our seniors and others with one hand and takes away so much more with their other hand. I can tell you from my own riding - and I'm sure other members have had the same experience - every day I meet seniors who are living in their own homes, even in apartments, that they are wanting to stay in, that their health allows them to stay in, even if it's with a little help like home care. But some of them are giving up their homes, or their apartments, not because of their health, but because they can't afford to stay there anymore. The power bill comes in, their pension has not gone up but their power bill has gone up by 30 per cent or more. Their home heating fuel bill has gone up by multiples and multiples. Their property taxes go up by more than the $200 that the government wants to relieve them of.</p>
<p>I have seniors that I know personally in Parrsboro and Springhill, I have been in their apartments, literally in the wintertime they close off rooms putting towels under the door to try to save on the electric bill, or save on the oil bill because they can't manage them anymore and heat their whole apartment. Now how sad is that? Not in my Nova Scotia, Madam Speaker, not in your Nova Scotia. That is not the kind of Nova Scotia we want today when people are forced to make those awful choices.</p>
<p>So, yes it's nice, and we agree, give seniors a break on their property taxes, another $200, relieve some more seniors from the burden of income tax on their low incomes, absolutely, but as long as power bills continue to skyrocket, as long as the cost of living in your modest apartment or home is out of reach, it is not an entire solution. It is a helpful thing but it does not fix the problem and Nova Scotians deserve a modern, dynamic, 21<sup>st</sup> Century government that knows how to manage the economy, create opportunity, and fix the problems like power rates, like taxes on gasoline, and the things that this budget and the NDP continue to accept.</p>
<p>Now I will say, in the time I have left, that I noticed with great interest and some amusement the Liberal criticism of the NDP budget. After all, they have their own record when it comes to budgeting both for their own Party and from the last time they were in government. I mentioned a moment ago that in 1999, not that long ago, the last time they were in government, on the eve of an election the Liberals tried to table a budget in this House that they said was balanced. I know there are some members of the current Liberal caucus who were in the government, even in the Cabinet at that time who are still here so they'll remember this, I'm sure, with great interest. But what Nova Scotians quickly found out with that so-called balanced budget is they weren't counting $600 million of more debt in the budget - $600 million. To hear the Liberals blame the NDP for not counting $27 million last year, one has to laugh at their own record when they did 20 times as much in their last budget at the same time - $600 million.</p>
<p>I am very proud that the Leader of the PCs at that time, the member for Pictou Centre, went on to become Premier, John Hamm became Premier because that member and that Party tried to pull a fast one on the people of Nova Scotia and he called them on it. He brought them down. He said no. He said that is not balanced; it is not right; it is wrong, and he called them on it, and he told Nova Scotians the truth. I hope the NDP are watching the sorry history of the Liberals because when Premier Hamm said no to fake budgeting, Nova Scotians elected him Premier. That's what made him Premier and he went on to set this province on a track for eight real balanced budgets. That was a great step forward for the province.</p>
<p>When they came in, it took them exactly one session of the Legislature to repeal the balanced budget law and throw us right back into significant, hundreds-of-million dollar deficits.</p>
<p>I know that some in the Liberals, even though they were there at the time, say, that's a long time ago now. We're really hoping that Nova Scotians forget about that because it was so long ago, even though they're still sitting here, in some cases. Under the current leadership of the Liberal Party, they ran an election campaign, trying to make a virtue of the fact that even though they sit here year after year and examine the estimates, that they didn't know the state of the province's books. That didn't stop them from making $527,750,000 in promises.</p>
<p>The time has come I think that I table that for the benefit of the House. I do have with me The ChronicleHerald examination of the Liberal platform from the last election which is amusingly, but accurately entitled, "LIBERAL PLATFORM; So, whose dog ate page 34?" I will briefly and accurately quote from this article, for the benefit of accuracy and for the benefit of the House, "Liberal briefers even gave the press a 33<sup>rd</sup> page &#x2026;" in their 32 page platform, "&#x2026; itemizing the four-year cost of all the party's promises. The grand total is $527.75 million." That's quite a whopping total from someone who says he doesn't know the state of the province's finances.</p>
<p>How irresponsible is that to say you want balanced budgets, to say you want to turn around, to say you want to be about the future but to engage in the worst kinds of pulling the wool over people's eyes? I don't know the state of the province's finances, he said, but I'm still going to promise half a billion dollars in more spending. Nova Scotians, rightly, rejected that old style approach.</p>
<p>Of course, there's more and I do want to share it with the House. " But the plan is missing a crucial page 34.", reports the Herald. "This would be the page showing us where the revenue comes from to pay for all the things on page 33." The $500 million that I was referring to earlier. "Minus page 34 &#x2026;" concludes this important examination of where Liberals come from, "&#x2026; the Liberal plan is not a full plan." More truthful words were never written in The ChronicleHerald and I will table that for the benefit of the House.</p>
<p>For those that say please forget 1999 when we forgot the $600 million in our budget, well let's go forward unto the current leadership and only a few short years ago, the very last election where they told Nova Scotians we don't know what the books look like but we're still going to promise half a billion dollars in spending. That is not a historical fact, that is a current fact for the Liberals and that is why their criticism of the NDP's $27 million is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Should we go on and bring the story up to even the present day? Madam Speaker, we can bring this up to the present day. For those one or two Liberals who are still hanging on to the hope that maybe the people forgot the election of 2009, the very last one, we have the record of the Liberals with their own trust funds just in the last year. You want to talk about transactions that move money off the current books and into some nebulous unknown place - well the NDP can't hold a candle to the Liberals at doing that because it took a law, it took an Act of the Legislature, to force them to, hopefully, do something with that $2.5 million of dirty money that they hung on to, including the current leadership, with their fingernails until they were forced by law to give it up.</p>
<p>Have they even complied with that law? Well we still don't know. Madam Speaker, we still don't know because all we have is a footnote in their own financial statements saying that they intend to, to some trust, the For the Public Good Trust - nobody knows where this trust is, nobody knows who the trustees are, nobody knows what they are doing with the money, and they won't tell us.</p>
<p>So every time the Liberals tell the NDP to be more transparent - I'll give some advice to the NDP - hold them to the same standard when it comes to their own trust fund. Hold them to the same standard. I mean, here is a Party that can't even manage a tiny little caucus office without the help of a consultant, here is a Party that can't even run a surplus in their own little book of accounts asking the people if they can run the entire Province of Nova Scotia. They have not won an election in this province, a majority election, in 20 years because Nova Scotians will not trust them as long as they hold on to that dirty money in that trust fund, and they won't this time either - and no one can say oh that's in the past as long as the current leadership hold on to it.</p>
<p>We also know, Madam Speaker, that just before that law passed they took over $300,000 of that dirty money out of the trust fund and put it on their own Party books and then spent it on TV ads - that's the record of the current Leader of the Liberal Party, that was his decision &#x2026;</p></speech>

I did start by thanking the Liberal Critic for her examination of the budget and I just want you to know - to return for a more pleasant topic - that I meant it, that she did a very good job of poking gigantic holes in the NDP budget.

RAMONA JENNEX</from><p>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, and thank you very much to the member opposite for giving me the opportunity to introduce to the House today two of our fine students from the Cape Breton Highlands Academy. Zoe Phillips and Hannah Phillips, both Grade 11 students, are in our O2 program and have been here the last couple of days at the O2 Showcase at the Westin. Accompanying them is their lead O2 teacher - that's Options and Opportunities - the community-based learning teacher, Neil MacDonald. Peyton Charmichael, who is over in Dartmouth doing a competition at the Akerley Campus, also came from their team from Cape Breton.</p>
<p>I would ask the members of the House to please give our guests a very warm reception here today. We're so glad that our guests were able to see us and the work that we do in the House. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I was just about to bring this to a conclusion by pointing out that in addition to all the criticism that goes on - and there are some who can only go to criticism and have nothing more to add - but a government only gets elected - and we saw this from Premier Hamm, and I want people to see it again now - when they give Nova Scotians a real plan for the future.</p>
<p>Far from taxing them more, far from promising them wild spending with no idea how to pay for it, that plan is to grow the economy and create jobs by lowering taxes like the HST equally for everybody; by paying for it by stopping wasteful government spending like all those health bureaucracies and the 10 health authorities and the subsidies to the Tim Hortons and the government bailouts of too many companies while small businesses struggle; by paying for it by stopping those things, creating more jobs that are sustainable and meaningful across the province; by training people through a world-class education system for the economy of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century; and by letting our job creators get on with the job of building a modern, dynamic economy based on lower taxes, frozen power rates, and better education and training.</p>
<p>Then we can truly say we have a balanced plan that pays for health and schools and other services we need. Only then can we get on to that better day and away from the kind of direction that we're under now from the NDP. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Yesterday I asked the Premier how many candidates there were for the job of Chief of Protocol and he didn't answer. According to a CTV report, the Premier said that some names were brought forward - and I will table that news item for the House. My simple question for the Premier today is, is the CTV report accurate?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to again, today, congratulate and thank the outgoing Chief Protocol Officer for the tremendous work she has done on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>
<p>I again want to remind this House that we hired a 30-year veteran of this province, someone who has worked as a journalist in both the public and private sector doing work on behalf of her clients, communicating. As well, we hired her on a contract basis where she is being paid less than the outgoing Protocol Officer - by the way, there is no buyout at the end of this contract, Mr. Speaker, unlike when the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party was hired by the former Progressive Conservative Government when he negotiated for himself a $20,000 raise for the position that he was applying for. Not only that, he negotiated for himself, on the back end, a full year's salary which would amount of $124,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we're doing exactly what Nova Scotians hired us to do - protect their hard-earned money.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I see that the old, angry, attack dog Premier has now returned. Let me just say, first of all, that nothing he just said is accurate. I negotiated no such thing - and for the benefit of all members of this House, I did work in a Premier's Office once and I did leave and my severance was exactly zero dollars. So let's be clear about that.</p>
<p>I also want to remind the Premier that during the election the Premier is quoted on the on-line service Reddit, in an Ask Me Anything session, as saying "&#x2026; openness and transparency are values I believe in and are values I will carry into government." And I will table that statement of fact.</p>
<p>The Premier has given us the same non-answer to our simple questions now 10 times in a row. I will ask him to live up to the words that he spoke during the election and I will try again with a simple question. How many names were brought forward for the job of Chief of Protocol and where did they come from?</p></speech>

            <p>Before I recognize the honourable Premier, I want to remind the honourable Leader of the Official Opposition to keep the language parliamentary in the description of the Premier, please.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm very proud of the fact that the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism has tabled a piece of legislation that will make this House, when it comes to economic development, more accountable than any other House in the entire country. (Applause)</p>
<p>Let me clear up the misconception that was brought forward by the Leader of the Progressive Conservatives. He negotiated a severance package if his contract was terminated. Unfortunately, they were returned to power and Nova Scotians had to suffer through another term of a Progressive Conservative Government, and at that point he moved into the private sector. Let's be very clear: his contract had a $124,000 severance if that contract was terminated. There is no such clause in any contract that I have negotiated as Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, nothing that the Premier just said is accurate, for the record. Perhaps we need a bill that makes the Premier of Nova Scotia accountable for his own actions as well as the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism.</p>
<p>Yesterday I asked the Premier if this hiring of a Chief of Protocol followed his own government's fair hiring policy, and he answered yes, although I now understand his officials in fact are saying no. Clearly he skirted his own policy to hire his friend and fellow Liberal. My question to the Premier is, why is he hiding the details - simple details like, was it advertised, and how many names came forward? - instead of being open and transparent as he promised during the election?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we were the Party that told Nova Scotians of the appointment. To correct what the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has just said, if you look at any protocol position in this province, whether it is the Chief Secretary to the Lieutenant Governor, it is a hire that is done by the person coming in. The same thing when it comes to the Chief Protocol Officer in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I want to be clear: every opportunity that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has had, when it has come to public money, he has made sure he's protected his own wallet. When he negotiated a contract for himself, there was $124,000, and I &#x2026;</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order. Order, please. I would remind all members that the Premier has the floor at the moment, and I would remind all members to please direct your comments through the Chair when you have the floor.</p>

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Just in case you didn't hear what I had to say, with all the noise in the House, I want to make it clear that when the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party negotiated a contract for himself, he made sure he negotiated a full-year salary at $124,000. But even better, when he left the Premier's Office to go to the private sector he called upon his friend Mr. Harper, who appointed him to two appointments that provided him with over $300,000 in taxpayers' money.

<p>Clearly, when it comes to being open and transparent, it applies to everyone but the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Premier. In 2003, the Progressive Conservative Government of the day appointed a former chief of staff from federal PC Cabinet Minister Kim Campbell's office to the position of Director of Corporate Communications for the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation. At that time, I'd like to table an article quoting the member for Preston-Dartmouth - now the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture - who told the Daily News that the person responsible for this hiring should quit or be fired for such a blatant act of patronage.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is, does he believe the patronage appointment of the Director of Corporate Communications for the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation in 2003 was wrong and that his Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture was correct when he said that the person responsible for this patronage hiring should be held accountable?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the question. What this government did was hire a qualified person to fill a vacancy that was left vacant by a 30-year person who decided to retire. In this province all protocol jobs - those associated to the Lieutenant Governor's position and those associated here - have been hires that have been made by the government.</p>
<p>It's quite interesting that the Leader of the New Democratic Party is standing in this House trying to lecture anyone when in actual fact, in the last Cabinet meeting they had, they saw fit to not only reward their political friends with very generous severance packages, they decided to top it up to a tune of $250,000. The taxpayers not only had to change governments but they had to pay out almost a million dollars to the NDP political appointees.</p></speech>

            <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Well I know why the Leader of the government, the Premier, is attempting to deflect from being accountable for the patronage appointment he just made - he thinks this isn't an important issue. He told reporters moments ago in the scrum that people on Main Street don't care about patronage in Nova Scotia, and in fact he's had very few emails on this, or phone calls. Perhaps the Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister was one of those people who contacted him. Given that the member from Preston-Dartmouth, back in 2003, on the Tory patronage appointment also had this to say about that appointment, and I quote from the Daily News, "This begs the question: what else is going on?"</p>

            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>What's going on is good government in the Province of Nova Scotia. Mr. Speaker, with every contract that has been signed by this premier, there is no buyout clause in any of them and all can be terminated by any future government at any time, unlike the NDP, who were in power just a few short months ago, and what did they do in the secrecy of the cabinet room, in the dying days? They bumped up severances that were already generous for their political friends. Not only did we turf the NDP Government but we got a bill for severances for a million dollars to look after.</p>

          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in the past 18 months two other provinces have filled the position of Chief of Protocol. In both cases they had well defined job descriptions, open and transparent hiring processes that were arm's length from the Cabinet and the Premier, hiring committees with members of Chiefs of Protocol from other provinces on them, and an independent panel, merit-based hiring.</p>
<p>I want to ask the Premier, why wouldn't you follow a fair-hiring process moving Nova Scotia forward instead of backward to the dark days of patronage in the Province of Nova Scotia?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>For a minute there, when she said the dark days, I thought she was referring to the early part of October and the last four years. Let's be clear with what happens in this province, Mr. Speaker. This government, with every contract that it has signed, this Premier, with every contract that I have put my name on, there is absolutely no buyout clause in any of them. Any future government can terminate those employees as they wish.</p>
<p>What happened when the former NDP Government signed contracts? They added very generous severance packages, but that wasn't good enough. After Nova Scotians told them they no longer wanted them to govern, what did they do? They went to the Cabinet Room and billed the taxpayers an extra million dollars so that they can give their friends some money on the way out the door.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the Premier if the position of Chief of Protocol was advertised. He didn't answer, so we know it wasn't. Just a few months ago in this House the Premier said "The job of government and indeed any Nova Scotian is to be open and honest." I will table that for the benefit of the House.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is, if he truly wanted to find the most qualified person for the job of Chief of Protocol, truthfully, why didn't the position get advertised?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we have introduced the most open and accountable piece of legislation when it comes to economic development and the disbursement of funds of any government in the history of this country.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, at every opportunity and every turn we've told - the questions about the contracts that we have signed, I want to be very clear to the people who are listening to this and the people in the gallery - that every contract that this government has signed, every contract that I have put my name on is open and transparent and there is no buyout clause at the end, unlike what the Progressive Conservative Leader negotiated for himself about a decade ago.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I struck that severance position out of my contract and got zero - that's what I did, and I just want to make the record clear. The reason I did is because paying off your friends at the beginning of your term is no better than paying them off at the end of your term, like the NDP did.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the Premier if he consulted the Public Service Commission on the hiring of his new friend, the Protocol Officer. He didn't answer, so we know he didn't. This is the same Premier who once said in this House, and I will table this, the same Premier who said "Mr. Speaker, it's not too much to ask the Premier to substantiate his comments in the House."</p>
<p>So if it's not too much to ask, who was consulted on the hiring of Ms. Langille?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, as I've said many times in this House, we hired a very qualified person to be Chief Protocol Officer in the Province of Nova Scotia. We hired her on a contract basis. In that contract she's being paid less than the outgoing Chief of Protocol Officer. I want to also remind all members of this House, in case they haven't heard me, there is no buyout at the end of this contract - and just to help clarify what the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party actually did, he left in that buyout clause just in case he got fired from that position; that buyout clause of $124,000 was there so that if the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party got turfed from his job he had a soft landing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that the only reference collected for Ms. Langille for the position of Chief of Protocol was the Premier himself who said on YouTube: "Nothing would make me happier than to have her working as part of a Liberal Government."</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, that YouTube video mysteriously was taken down late yesterday. So my question to the Premier, who pledges himself to openness and transparency, if the Premier did nothing wrong, why was the YouTube video removed?</p></speech>

But I will tell you again, there is no buyout clause. If there's one thing we know for certain, it is that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party certainly knows how to look after himself when it comes to negotiating a contract.</p>

Nothing the Premier said in his answer bears any resemblance to what actually happened - and he either knows it or he needs to find better researchers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier once said, as I pointed out earlier, the job of the government and, indeed, any Nova Scotian is to be open and honest and truthful. There seems to be some uncertainty about when Ms. Langille started with the government, so I will ask the Premier a simple and straightforward question. Once again, I hope I get a different answer than the canned answer he has given us 12 times already. On what date was Ms. Langille hired, and will he produce a signed copy of her contract before the end of Question Period today?</p></speech>

The Premier said the media was informed on Tuesday. I do find that very interesting, for a Premier who said he wants to be upfront with Nova Scotians about this hiring. It's an important ceremonial job, but there was no press release, and there was no announcement. It was a verbal passing-on of information to the media at the end of Question Period on Tuesday.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is, if this is all above-board and upfront, why was there no announcement made using the usual means of press release and so on?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this government has done a tremendous amount of work on behalf of Nova Scotians, and unlike previous governments, we don't run down to the press release machine and throw one out. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure where the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party comes from.</p>
<p>I do want to remind him that there is no one from CNS who actually is in my office, because unlike previous governments, we want Communications Nova Scotia to stay away from political messages and communicate to Nova Scotians. That's what we're going to continue to do, to be open and transparent with Nova Scotians.</p></speech>

Now we've made another small step forward.</p>
<p>We all know that if the Premier truly believed he had done nothing wrong, there would have been a proper press release. There would have been a proper announcement, and there wasn't.</p>
<p>All of the hiring under the government's fair hiring policy are subject to freedom of information disclosure. The Premier has now refused to answer straightforward questions 18 times here in the House of Assembly in the last two days. He has avoided being open and transparent by breaking his own rules around the fair hiring policy in the case of the Chief of Protocol. If the Premier truly believes that he did nothing wrong and truly wishes to stand by his own words, which he spoke before the election, that the job of government is to be open and transparent, will the Premier agree to release all documentation and communications about the hiring of Ms. Langille, including her contract, so Nova Scotians can judge for themselves?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#c479d7de-83a6-47c7-a045-07816407bdb3"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Premier. On October 1, 2013, the Premier, then the Leader of the Opposition, wearing a pair of orange-coloured Fall flip-flops, told the HRM council that the province should not be making unilateral decisions on issues that impact HRM, and that "&#x2026; it's the responsibility of the provincial government to respect the decision of council." I'll table a copy of the minutes from that council meeting.</p>
<p>On May 21, 2013, the Premier, this time sporting a pair of yellow-coloured Spring flip-flops, wrote to the Chair of the Otter Lake Community Monitoring Committee, saying "&#x2026; it is the position of the Nova Scotia Liberal Caucus that we will not entertain amending the Industrial Permit, nor relaxing provincial legislation or regulations that impact the operation of the Otter Lake Landfill." I will also table that.</p>
<p>My question for the Premier, since these commitments are obviously in complete contradiction to each other, how do you plan to keep both of these commitments?</p></speech>

            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>I want to thank the honourable member for the question, Mr. Speaker, and I want to reassure her that HRM Council, through the great work by the deputy mayor, is actually agreeing with the provincial government.</p>

ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, well on Tuesday, November 12<sup>th</sup>, HRM Council voted against a motion that would stop controversial changes at the Otter Lake Landfill. This means that the HRM council is moving ahead with plans to eliminate front-end processing and the waste stabilization facility at the landfill, despite overwhelming opposition by local residents.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Environment Minister said in this House, "&#x2026; it is the position of the department and the government that we will not entertain modifications to the existing approval."</p>
<p>My question to the Premier, given his very public commitment to respect all HRM Council decisions, now that he is Premier, how is he going to keep his commitment to the people of Otter Lake?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>I want to thank the Minister of Environment for the great work he is doing on behalf of all Nova Scotians but particularly the residents of HRM in making sure that they protect that facility and the environment surrounding that facility.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what I find very interesting is a question coming from the NDP about municipal government. That is the same Party that showed disregard for those elected bodies across this province by tearing up a memorandum of understanding and telling them to take it or leave it. The difference now is municipal governments across this province are grateful that the people of this province elected a new government, one that wants to work with them and be their partner.</p></speech>

<p>in Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River and Colchester County is very pleased to see me back in this Legislature.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, on April 24<sup>th</sup> the former Environment Minister told Mayor Savage, in no uncertain terms, would HRM be allowed to change the terms of the permit for Otter Lake? At the time, Councillor Steve Adams said, "The letter from the Minister is quite definitive and that's what's put this process to an end." I will table that.</p>
<p>But, lo and behold, public hearings and council votes on Otter Lake continue. So my third and final question for the Premier, has his government told the HRM Mayor and council that changes to the Otter Lake permit will or will not be considered?</p></speech>

I'm not sure what part of his response the member opposite missed but he was very clear that there would be no changes. We would be respecting the original permit that was put in place and the process that was there.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, again, whether she is the Critic for the Environment, she is a member of a former government that showed so little regard for municipal governments across this province that I find it hard to believe there is a single municipal official who is grateful that any New Democrat is back in this House.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, on November 8<sup>th</sup> the federal Citizenship and Immigration Minister made big changes to one of Canada's most popular immigration programs, the Canadian Experience Class, what they call the CEC. These changes are bad news for potential immigrants to Nova Scotia, so my question to the minister is, could she provide details about the conversation between she and her federal counterpart after she called Ottawa to express her frustration over these short-sighted changes?</p>

<p>You're quite correct, there were various changes made to the CIC Act and I will certainly attempt to answer your question, but definitely not today. This is a very complicated regulation that has been made to the Act and I'm actually in the process of contacting the federal minister to have a face-to-face meeting with him.</p></speech>

But what is most troubling about these changes were the new qualifications regarding who will be excluded from the program. Effective November 9<sup>th</sup>, experience in certain jobs will no longer qualify an applicant for the CEC; jobs like cooks, bookkeepers, food service, and retail managers, and others.</p>
<p>My question to the Minister of Immigration is, does the minister agree with the Conservatives that people who work in these sorts of occupations deserve less of an opportunity to become Canadians?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this question through you is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. This month the Canadian Federation of Independent Business produced a report on the state of apprenticeship in Nova Scotia. I wish I could say it was a positive report, and I'll table that. Instead, it confirmed many of our concerns. We are on track to face a serious labour crisis with high out-migration, low immigration, and an aging population. Things need to change. Young Nova Scotians are looking for leadership to make needed changes to apprenticeships. This is clearly an issue that cannot wait. My question to the minister, how much longer will small businesses have to suffer until changes are made to apprenticeships?</p>

            <from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from>
            <p>I would like to welcome the member back to the House after his involuntary sabbatical. The member is correct that there are concerns around the current apprenticeship regime in this province. For example, our apprentices are starting their apprenticeships two years older than the average across the country, and they take longer to actually finish their apprenticeship - about two years longer as well. We do have a problem there with our apprentices. Nova Scotia businesses need workers and our skilled workers need experience. One of the things that we've discovered is that during a slowdown, we have workers who are not completing their apprenticeship because there is no work for them. We are actually working with the community college, with business, and we expect to have a new plan very soon. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, after those kind words I feel like taking a second and third question with me and putting it aside. However, I will continue. The Liberal platform suggests that there would be changes to the apprenticeship program in the current year. Nearly half of all small business owners point to apprenticeships as potential solutions to the labour shortage. They are facing many roadblocks including high costs, poaching risks, information deficiencies, inflexible training arrangements, and provincial inconsistencies across the country. This long list of barriers makes it difficult, if not impossible, for many employers to hire and train apprentices. My question to the minister is, when can small businesses expect some relief?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, 7,000 new skilled tradespeople will be needed in Nova Scotia over the next seven years. We need more skilled tradespeople and we need them now. Twenty-one per cent of small business owners in the region point to restrictive ratios as an obstacle in providing apprenticeship training. Without more Nova Scotians training, the demand will be difficult to meet and small business will suffer. My question to the minister is, why does the minister continue to wait when Nova Scotia jobs and the economy are on the line?</p></speech>

However, we're not going to do this in a vacuum. We are committed to consulting with business and my answer still stands that you will see a new apprenticeship regime soon.</p>

It's December and the weather is getting colder. We're getting calls about the Heating Assistance Rebate Program, and I'm sure the minister's office is also. However, when they were on this side of the House, the members of the Liberal Party often criticized the previous government who made changes to ensure more people would qualify for the Heating Assistance Rebate Program saying that the program was inadequate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the honourable member, with regard to the Heating Assistance Rebate Program, and I will table a passage from Hansard from the member for Preston-Dartmouth. He said, "Mr. Speaker, $200 doesn't even cover one-third of the cost of a fill-up of fuel."

            <from>MR. FUREY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges we face in maintaining the program is an upload of new applicants given the expiration of the three-year period. So it is our intention to continue to monitor the program. The cap rate of $200 at the present time is valuable to recipients, they've indicated that in feedback they've provided. We'll continue with that cap at the present time. We'll continue to monitor it and depending on the upload, we may, in the future, be able to adjust that cap.</p>

PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable member for his answer, but I can tell him that there is no requirement to monitor the program. We know that $200, as was criticized by the Liberals when they sat on this side, is not enough for individuals or families because it does not provide enough oil for heat in their homes. I guess it is different when they sit on the other side.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Liberals also promised to decrease nearly every government department's spending by 1 per cent. That includes the Department of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations. That would mean a cut of $0.25 million.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to ask the minister, can he tell us where the cuts will come from in his department? Does that mean that the Heating Assistance Rebate Program will be cut for the poor, or jobs in his department that help process those very applications?</p></speech>

<p>My question to the minister is, has the minister made any immediate changes within her department to ensure that vulnerable people are protected and background checks are done in a standardized fashion?</p></speech>

            <p>I'd like to thank the honourable member for the question. We will be following all the recommendations of the Ombudsman. From someone who has come from community and working with very vulnerable children and women, that absolutely is a priority in my tenure as Minister of Community Services.</p>

            <p>Thank you for that answer. Now this is a serious issue and while legislation is needed to make sure all necessary checks are performed, history has shown us that this is not something we can afford to wait on. The Ombudsman pointed out that there are many situations where service providers may not know when a background check is needed. Some do not include criminal record checks, and others do. The inconsistencies can put people at risk. My question to the Minister of Community Services is, will the minister require retroactive background checks for those who were not otherwise properly reviewed?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we will be abiding by all of the recommendations of the Ombudsman's Office. One of the things that I've currently changed, as well, is that any volunteers who want to go on any of the ABCs that are directly linked to the Department of Community Services are now, for the first time ever, required to have a background check. I feel very strongly about this. There is absolutely no reason why anyone connected with our department, dealing with vulnerable populations, does not have a background check.</p>

          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. The Premier has tasked the Minister of Finance with the responsibility for overseeing the province's finances. This is an incredibly important task, and indeed no small job. I know that the minister is up to the task, because she has been watching the province's finances for quite some time. In fact, last April, while in Opposition, the minister expressed a lot of concern over the NDP's budget. Many Nova Scotians shared the minister's concern about the budget. Many Nova Scotians questioned whether it was actually balanced or not, and they are now anxious to see how the actual results are comparing to the expectations of the budget.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, can we expect an update on the budget situation to be released before the House rises?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2">
            <from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for that question. This is something that I know is important to all Nova Scotians, to see what the state of the finances is. We are waiting right now for a little bit more information. As the members will know, we've received new information on the economy - the growth or, in some cases, the negative growth in the economy. Some of the difficulties have been the outflow of people, a decline in population, and a higher unemployment. In the Finance Department we take all of that information to make our forecasts and to see where we're at during the year. Right now we're waiting on one further piece of information on HST.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her answer. I'm glad to hear she's compiling additional information, because as we know, we all hear statistics over and over about the state of the province. We hear numbers like $14 billion in debt, depreciating infrastructure, 11,000 fewer jobs as compared to four years ago. In fact, we hear those numbers so much that they may start to lose their impact on some of us, but of course, not on me with my fascination for numbers. Nova Scotians do deserve to know the truth about our financial situation, and while in Opposition, one aspect of the NDP budget that the minister seemed particularly worried about were the NDP's financial revenue projections.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, having now had 50 days to look at the books, is the minister confident that when she gets this final piece of information, the forthcoming update will provide this House and, in fact, all Nova Scotians, with a true representation of our bottom line that Nova Scotians can rely on?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you again for that question. The question's very good, will it be a true representation, and that's something I can assure the members of this House that it will be. We want to make sure everything is transparent and open. (Applause) Unlike the two Parties in Opposition, this government did not promise to lower the HST when we did not have money in the budget to do that. I think that's very important.</p>
<p>What I see already with the revenue projections are clearly, clearly there is not money in the budget to lower the HST as both Opposition Parties promised. It was irresponsible to do so, particularly for the NDP who knew very well what the province's budget looked like. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I again thank the minister for her answer. I'm glad to hear they're going to try to be prudent with the province's finances, although in their platform they promised many millions of dollars of spending with really no way to substantiate how they would afford them.</p>
<p>One question I would like to clarify this afternoon is last winter, the minister spoke a number of times about the NDP's prepayment of universities and other fiscal shell games. My sense is that the minister was deeply uncomfortable with the practice of the prior government that saw expenses shifted between fiscal years. I am also uncomfortable about this practice and worry that it is misleading to Nova Scotians. My question today for the minister is, knowing that while in Opposition the Liberal Party disagreed with the practice of prepaying universities, will the minister commit that there will be no prepayments or shifting of expenses around fiscal periods in this financial update?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the question, again. This issue won't arise in the update because that was something that happened in the budget. It was a payment made by the NDP Government at the time to load extra money into the previous year's deficit in order to show what they called a balanced budget for this current year. My fiscal update will show where we are this year going forward and how it's unfolding. As I said, I have some real concerns about the revenue estimates.</p>
<p>I believe I was right when I spoke here in the House when the budget was introduced. The forecast estimates were rosy, to say the least. They took the most optimistic possible scenarios in order to build the revenue into the budget. I think when I point out the recent economic information that's coming in - not the least of which is a declining population, which will be equivalent to millions of dollars less in transfer payments from the federal government - all of those figures are pointing to the fact that the NDP Government inflated their revenue figures.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday was dumping day for our lobster fishers in fishing areas 33 and 34, and if the catch in fishing area 35 is any indication, they can expect another bountiful harvest this year. Unfortunately, as fishers know far too well, large harvests may bring down the prices. My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is, now that the new CETA agreement has been signed, what steps is this new government taking to increase demand for Nova Scotia lobster in the European market?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this is a very important topic that the former Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture brings up. It's very important that we move forward in marketing our product as a quality product from Canada, and we're in the process of working out an arrangement with the other provinces, as the member would know. To achieve that, there's going to be a long, difficult road. There are many issues that have to be addressed that have been outstanding for more than four years.</p>

I don't know if he managed to get down to the wharf on dumping day, but in case he didn't, I can tell you that in southwestern Nova Scotia, the temperature was low but the enthusiasm was high. My question to the minister is - it has been demonstrated over and over again that MSC certification is extremely important to the European consumer. In May of this year, my NDP Government committed to funding MSC certification for the Nova Scotia lobster industry. Can the minister provide an update on how the certification process is currently going on and will he commit to that financial commitment that we did previously?</p>

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 9 be now read a second time. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on a fundamental piece of legislation that sets the stage for how this government provides economic development assistance to business.</p>
<p>On October 8<sup>th</sup>, Nova Scotians sent a message. They spoke with their votes and we heard them loud and clear. On that day Nova Scotians voted for change on how this province is governed, how the government treats Nova Scotians, and how the government will address economic challenges our province is facing.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, today this government sits in the Legislature with a strong mandate from the people of Nova Scotia. We have a vision that builds on the strengths of our people and communities. We will work with entrepreneurs whether they operate small, medium or large businesses. We will work with organizations and work with communities. We will listen and treat Nova Scotians with respect and will be more transparent and accountable to Nova Scotians about how their tax dollars are invested.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we come into government having to face some tough realities. We have an aging population, a shrinking workforce, and regions of high unemployment. At the same time there are skilled worker shortages, lags in productivity, and low investments in capital and R&amp;D by the private sector, and the opportunities and challenges that come along with the globalization of business.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we wanted to make it easier for businesses to grow, prosper and create jobs in Nova Scotia. We can do that by helping to create a fair and competitive business environment and by providing financial incentives and other forms of support to help grow their operations. Every jurisdiction in Canada is trying to do the same thing and we know we are often competing for the same opportunities. Having a clear economic vision and the right mix of programming is critical as our government creates the path for our province's economic future. Our vision includes supporting innovation, harnessing research, maximizing our advantages, eliminating barriers to competitiveness, and getting government out of the way of business.</p>
<p>Our government will undertake a full, comprehensive tax review. We are hoping that review will identify changes that we can make to allow Nova Scotia to have a much more competitive business environment. Businesses must be allowed to prosper but not at the expense of the true investor, which is the people of Nova Scotia. Being open and upfront with Nova Scotians is the first step in our commitment to support economic growth. Nova Scotians expressed great concern with investments made in the past. They did not understand why so much money was being invested, what the terms were, or what the outcome was expected to be.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we will set the bar higher and Nova Scotians will see the difference for themselves. With this legislation, Nova Scotians will have access to more information about the government's financial transactions than ever before. We will make all of our provincial investments available on-line for all to see. We will do this on behalf of taxpayers, because it's their hard-earned money and they deserve to know. It won't require a freedom of information application, and it won't fall to the media to track it down. The same information about every transaction will be posted: the type of assistance and what activities the money will be used for.</p>
<p>Details on all amendments will be posted, too. Mr. Speaker, no longer will amendments be done behind closed doors, as was done by the previous government. We will change the practice when it comes to amendments by putting it on-line for all Nova Scotians to see and, most importantly, for all Nova Scotians to judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we will also build in regular updates. Nova Scotians will find out whether their investments are being used the way they were intended to be used. Every six months each transaction will report on targets and timelines.</p>
<p>This legislation affects all deals signed after this government came to office on October 22, 2013. Nova Scotians deserve this level of transparency so they can understand the results and the reasons for their investments. This is one way of showing Nova Scotians that we have heard their concerns and are keeping our commitment to transparency and accountability. (Applause)</p>
<p>The Opposition may claim this information was available before, but Mr. Speaker, that just isn't the case. By making such a claim, it shows the lack of respect the past government had for Nova Scotians. In fact, no other Canadian province is currently providing this type of transparency, and it certainly wasn't done in the past in our province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'd now like to address the business community. With this bill, businesses will know that doing business with the province means being honest with the true investor, Nova Scotians. We are very cognizant of the fact that we must not only ensure the interests of those who we will be investing with, but at the same time, that we do not put Nova Scotia taxpayers' investments at risk.</p>
<p>We will develop the regulations for this legislation and we will respect our obligations under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act and trade agreements so that we strike the right balance for our province.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia is open for business, and we want to attract and support companies that want to grow and prosper here. That's why we have announced the third-party review, which will be underway very shortly. It will look at the tools we use to support businesses today, through Innovacorp, Nova Scotia Business Inc., and the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. It will consider incentives being used in other jurisdictions so we can develop a mix of programs that will ensure we get the best value for money for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I said yesterday, there is a sense of optimism in our province. We are looking forward to the Ivany commission's report on our best opportunities for our future economy, with Nova Scotians as true and informed partners along the way. Merci beaucoup.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to speak to this Bill No. 9, although I am somewhat perplexed as to what it really will achieve at the end of the day. For five decades, governments in Nova Scotia have been buying jobs through corporate bailouts, handouts and giveaways, and this is totally unacceptable. It's a system of economic development that really no longer works, if it really ever did.</p>
<p>If we look back in time, we all know that all three Parties have attempted to create and retain and maintain jobs through bailouts. Just in my humble opinion, we really, truly are all guilty and we must change. Although I don't want to backpedal a lot on it, I think that we need to realize that we need to look at the past not as a hitching post, but more or less as a guiding post, and do what is best for all Nova Scotians. We only have to look at the state of our economy and the number of Nova Scotians looking for work to know and realize that bailing out companies is not the right thing to do. Bailout economics simply do not work. As our Leader often says, if bailouts worked, then we would all have three jobs.</p>
<p>We know bailouts don't work. Then what does Bill No. 9 really do for us? What does it do for all Nova Scotians?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I wonder, will this bill actually cure our sick economy? I think we all know the answer to that, it won't. I feel, personally, that we're experiencing the longest economic cleansing we ever had to in Nova Scotia and we have to ask ourselves, will it create jobs? The only job that I can really think of that it might create is a Web site administrator to post it, and I think that's pretty sad when we think about that.</p>
<p>I think you have to ask yourself, and really stop and think about it, does it stop the failed policy of corporate bailouts? Does this bill take decisions out of the hands of politicians so they can be made based purely on merit? Mr. Speaker, it does nothing of the sort and I'm really somewhat disappointed in this bill because it really does nothing for all Nova Scotians. Bill No. 9 doesn't say we need to do things differently to create jobs in this province, it doesn't say that all.</p>
<p>What Bill No. 9 says is, let us continue doing the same thing over and over again that we complained about in expensive attack ads. Let's keep doing that but let's add a Web site while we're at it. This bill puts into law procedures about how to document the details of a failed system. Putting those details on a public Web site, though, won't tell Nova Scotians everything that we don't already know. Everyone knows that bailouts don't work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, transparency in government is always a good thing. For instance openness and transparency in hiring practices is something that Nova Scotians expect from their government. However, I don't think Nova Scotians will thank this government for shining the light on a system that the Liberals themselves said they would put an end to. It simply is a contradiction.</p>
<p>We know the Liberal election campaign literature said, "Liberals will end corporate give-aways and make it easier for small businesses to succeed," I will table that for the House. There is nothing about this that says stop corporate giveaways or makes it easier for businesses, Mr. Speaker. This does nothing to fulfill the election promise and it doesn't make it easier for small businesses to succeed. Lower taxes, lower power rates, and less red tape, that's what helps a small business to succeed and I should know because I am an owner of a small business.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our caucus cannot support this bill as it does nothing. We cannot support the old way of doing things that has failed our province and betrayed our taxpayers, thank you.</p></speech>

DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>It is an honour to speak about this bill today introduced by the government, An Act to Ensure Accountability in Providing Economic Development Assistance in Nova Scotia. I do understand that the minister feels a need to continue to play the political perception game by presenting this bill. This bill has little substance. It is to make it look like something is being done, when actually it is just to divert the attention from the fact that while they stood on this side of the House they were very clear that they were not going to give any money to corporations. (Interruption)</p>
<p>Actually, Mr. Speaker, it was said over and over again. Neither the Progressive Conservatives' nor the Liberals' history is a good history in terms of bailouts over the years. We only have to mention Sydney Steel and people throughout this province know immediately what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, at its core, the deliverables arising from this bill already exist, and they have for years, because in fact there is a whole office of people whose sole job is to provide information that people want and that is called the Information Access and Privacy Office. My greatest concern is whether this bill will act in a different manner. Will there be necessary disclosure of information that may be a deterrent to major businesses? We all know that businesses at that level need a competitive edge, so they are very concerned about their competitors.</p>
<p>There is no information whatsoever in this bill addressing that. There has been little or no consultation with major corporations to be able to get an insight into what their concerns may be and what their suggestions may be.</p>
<p>What about our Privacy Act in Canada, and how is that going to fit into this particular bill? Certainly I agree, and I know my caucus agrees, that if there is a manner to make information easier to access for the people of Nova Scotia, that is the way to go. But again, I caution the minister that he needs to consult with businesses and make sure that the decision being made here may not create some lost opportunities in our province.</p>
<p>What I have to bring to the very point, Mr. Speaker, is that this is not about putting information on-line and being transparent. The discussion here is really about one thing, and one thing only. That is the fact that the Liberal Party, in Opposition and during the election, told Nova Scotians very loudly and clearly that they would not support funding to large corporations. That is what they said. I didn't say it; the Progressive Conservatives didn't say it; the NDP didn't say it. It was the Liberal Party going door-to-door, looking in the faces of Nova Scotians and pretending that they are honest and trustworthy by saying, we will not give to large corporations.</p></speech>

Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that during the election the words that were being used were "trust," "change," and "first for Nova Scotia." Those were not our words. Those were the words of the Liberal Party. Those are the words that Nova Scotians are carrying with them each and every day, because of the fact that they did go to the polls, and they made their decision. They made their decision based on the words that they heard, and they made their decisions on belief, believing that this Party was going to come forth with change and be able, as they said, to trust them. How do you trust a newly-elected government that flip-flops immediately?</p>
<p>There were two major issues that were thrown at us in this House on an almost daily basis when the House was open, and I'm sure their memories are not that short. If they are, then we're really in trouble. They said time and time again, we would not give to major corporations, and we also do not think it is appropriate for Cabinet to be part of that decision-making process.</p>
<p>What was the first thing they did on this file? Well, the first thing they did on this file was to decide they would give money to corporations, and the second thing is that we will leave it in the hands of Cabinet's decision. They criticized us for that. So how can you criticize a government for one way of doing business, and then you come in and you don't even attempt to change that? If that is not a true flip-flop, if that is not creating a political perception - and now the people of Nova Scotia are saying, what did we do?</p>
<p>I know that in four years or four and a half years it will come back to bite them. It definitely will, because people will not forget. The whole concept of corporate funding became a political perception that they won the battle on in this House and in this province. Believe me, that will go for them, too - what goes around comes around. It's a belief that I have, Mr. Speaker. And it will come around, because Nova Scotians are not going to put up with the fact that these people on the opposite side, who are government members now, knocked on doors, talked to poor individuals, talked to businesses, talked to seniors and said to them, we will not support funding major corporations. It's as simple as that.</p>
<p>What changed when they went into government? What changed was the political perception. They won the game, and now they're playing a different game, and that game will come back to bite them. Bill No. 9 is a waste of our paper and ink because all it is is to try to continue that political game, to tell Nova Scotians, oh, we're doing something about it. We're making it transparent. With a hit of a button, you can go on-line and see where we're spending your tax dollars - when they told Nova Scotians that they would not spend their tax dollars on major corporations, and that is what Nova Scotians are going to remember. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today and say a few words about Bill No. 9. During the last campaign, the Liberal Party told Nova Scotians they would end bailouts. I know we're hearing some murmurs from the backbenchers over there that they're only going to end the bailouts for certain types of corporations or certain types of situations. The fact of the matter is, you can't really just define what a bailout is and keep doing the same thing and pretending it's different.</p>
<p>They didn't say they would tweak the bailout process. They said that a Liberal Government would end corporate giveaways. I'm sure Nova Scotians who voted to end corporate giveaways will be surprised by Bill No. 9. With this bill, the Liberals are telling voters, those people that supported them, we aren't really going to end corporate giveaways like we said we would; we're going to keep doing them, but we're going to let you know the details of them. That's just silly.</p>
<p>Bill No. 9 tells them that this government is not going to do what it said it would do. The history of bailouts in our province is not a happy one. You can't take a broken system and make it less broken. This government had a chance to fix it and they've decided to look the other way. This province has a history of using bailouts as a bribe to business - sometimes to bring jobs here, sometimes to keep the jobs here. More often than not, the bribes have not been successful.</p>
<p>The Dartmouth company called Scanway is proof of just that. In 2010, Scanway was handed $4.75 million taxpayer dollars &#x2026;</p></speech>

(Laughter) I would like to see $4.75 million worth of Unni's cooking any day of the week and I apologize for that. (Applause) We're talking about Scanwood here folks, and I apologize.</p>
<p>In 2010, Scanwood was handed $4.7 million taxpayer dollars to keep jobs here. Those jobs were gone within two years. That was a terrible use of our taxpayer dollars, but it's a great example of why this bill does nothing to create jobs or improve our economy. Let's imagine for one second that Bill No. 9 had been in place in 2010 when the Scanwood company got their bailout. Would that business still be a going concern because of this bill? No, it wouldn't. Would Bill No. 9 prevent the loss of jobs at Scanwood? Not likely.</p>
<p>You can set the bar as high as you want in terms of disclosure, but if it's a bad deal, it's still a bad deal, and it doesn't matter if you tell Nova Scotians all about it. Bill No. 9 would simply give Nova Scotians more insight into the reasons why corporate bailouts don't work and should not continue. You don't build a modern, dynamic, 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy when government tries to get in the business of picking winners and losers. You do it by levelling the playing field so all entrepreneurs can do what they do best &#x2013; create jobs. You do it by lowering taxes, freezing power rates, and stopping wasteful government spending.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if the NDP had not spent over $600 million on bailouts - $600 million - that's money that could have been used to lower taxes, which would have created jobs. The Liberals told voters that they were going to put a stop to this, and Nova Scotians believed them. Sadly, they are now walking away from that and doing something different. As my colleague said earlier, Bill No. 9 simply puts into law procedures about how to document the details of a failed system. Putting those details on a public Web site won't tell Nova Scotians anything that they don't already know. Everyone knows that the bailouts aren't working. Nova Scotians will tell you that handouts to corporations aren't putting food on their tables, or paying for their kids' braces, or putting oil in their tanks. We need new ideas in government, and this bill is just more of the same.</p>
<p>What Bill No. 9 is going to do is create a bunch of reports, and forms, and red tape that will actually kill jobs in Nova Scotia. It's just a bad idea. Now, as you can tell, we're disappointed by this bill because it really doesn't do anything to make the lives of Nova Scotians better. Even as it's written, it's incomplete. The bill says that the minister shall publish, twice annually, a report showing the recipient's progress in meeting targets and timelines. That report will come from the recipients, and given to the minister who will put it on-line. So what are we going to do if the recipient doesn't provide a report? Will the minister then publish a report showing what penalties or what action the minister is taking for the failure of the company to provide the reports? These are the types of things that we need to think through with this bill. If you're going to do something like that, you might as well make it complete.</p>
<p>We need solutions to our problems. Bill No. 9 isn't a solution to any problem. Our caucus cannot support this bill, as it does nothing. We cannot support the old way of doing things that has failed our province and betrayed our taxpayers for so long. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the comments from the members of the Opposition. In the last election campaign Nova Scotians spoke loud and clear about wanting to have accountability and transparency when it came to investments being made by the Province of Nova Scotia. Bill No. 9 will do what no other Canadian jurisdiction is currently doing. That is something for all of us to be proud of.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure if the Official Opposition may have missed this, but in the House, I've already indicated that we are undergoing a third-party review of all economic development tools that we have in the province. Even further than that, we have indicated that the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund, as it currently exists, will be no more.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that we've said that, and yet the Opposition still accuses us of wanting to do things the way they were done by the previous administration, rings hollow to say the least. The member for Pictou East says we already did one. That's a bit of the flip-flop that we're hearing from the Official Opposition. An earlier bill they brought in was to give all the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund to NSBI, arm's length, and let NSBI make their own decisions. Yet when NSBI brought forward a decision, which we supported knowing that the board, which is made up of very well-respected business leaders throughout the province, which is arm's length, came forward and said we believe this is an appropriate investment for our Nova Scotia taxpayers. The Official Opposition criticized it.</p>
<p>You can't have it both ways. You can't say let's change the way we do things and let NSBI have control of this, and then criticize the decisions that they make and say that's not the way it's supposed to be. So the Official Opposition has to decide once and for all what it is they want to see.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have to say, I was disappointed to hear the comments made by the critic for the NDP. The suggestion that the NDP - and I'd be curious, if the former member for Halifax Fairview was here, to hear what she just said criticizing us for suggesting information be put on a Web site - and she, in turn, said you can already get that through freedom of information; why would you want to put it up on a Web site? Well, I'd love to hear what his take would be on that comment coming from his old Party, the NDP. Suggesting transparency and accountability, whether you're in Cape Breton or Yarmouth or anywhere else, that you can click on the Internet and get this information, that the NDP would now suggest no, make Nova Scotians go through the freedom of information process if they truly want to get that information - I have to say, what a marked departure for the NDP on that specific issue.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>Mr. Speaker</from><p>Another comment that the member made that I couldn't help - she referred to what we do as a game. Mr. Speaker, the trust that Nova Scotians have put into us is to ensure that we do everything possible to carry out the responsibility we've been given, to respect Nova Scotians and to move this province forward. I tell you, : for us, that is not a game.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I do want to say that I did appreciate the comments being made, and I found them interesting, from the members for both Pictou West - the critic - and Pictou East. I do look forward to hearing their comments as we move forward in the days and weeks ahead, when it will come to issues such as DSTN, Maritime Steel, and Northern Pulp. I really look forward to hearing exactly what their positions are when it will come to addressing questions facing those companies and other companies in Pictou County.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing this bill pass. As always, we look forward to seeing it go through the Law Amendments Committee process and any changes that may be suggested at that particular time. With that, I now move that we close debate on second reading of Bill No. 9.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, today I move that Bill No. 10, an Act to Amend Chapter 9 of the Acts of 2012, the Maritime Link Act, now be read a second time.</p>
<p>This bill contains a number of important amendments to the Maritime Link Act, amendments that will help move the Maritime Link project forward. After significant efforts of government, the Department of Energy staff and interveners, to ensure ratepayers were protected, our government has introduced amendments that will enable the project to proceed. Our amendments make it clear that the URB has full authority over the project and ensures Nova Scotia Power Maritime Link (NSPML) complies with all board decisions.</p>
<p>This bill makes certain that the URB decisions are fully supported in legislation. We have now ensured beyond a shadow of a doubt that the full decision of the board stands. The amendments are designed to provide NSPML with a number of authorities for the construction and operation of electrical utility projects in a very limited geographic area. Most importantly, the changes will allow the project proponents to access the necessary financing with the security of the federal loan guarantee. The federal loan guarantee is a crucial component to the Maritime Link - it will significantly lower the borrowing costs of the project and save ratepayers millions of dollars. The protection of ratepayers has always been our number-one priority. As we've said before, if the project went ahead it should do so with the benefit of the federal loan guarantee.</p>
<p>I can also tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the province has signed a Canada-Nova Scotia indemnity agreement, and we are close to completing negotiations for use of Crown lands to build the subsea cable. We expect the Crown land use agreement for the Cabot Strait-Subsea Corridor to be finished very soon. The indemnity agreement is necessary to access federal support for the loan guarantee. As a condition of the guarantee, the province agrees it will not increase risks for the federal government. The agreement is standard commercial practice and does not impact the URB's ability to protect ratepayers' interests. At the end of the day those agreements will allow us to access up to $250 million in savings over the life of the project, putting the interests of Nova Scotia ratepayers first.</p>
<p>As the public record shows, we have always believed the Maritime Link was a project with potential, and we had concerns with how the deal was structured. Now that the URB has made a final decision that includes our conditions, we can move forward knowing that ratepayers are better protected. This project, as laid out in the URB decision, provides multiple benefits to Nova Scotians. We now have a guarantee of access to market energy. The result will be a competitive energy market, which we have promoted for some time. In addition to Nalcor Energy, we will be able to access competitive power from other sources. We now have guarantees of access to surplus energy, something we clearly did not have before.</p>
<p>Of highest importance is the fact that risk is shifted away from ratepayers to Emera and Nalcor. Mr. Speaker, we certainly didn't have that before. The revised agreement goes even further to outline exactly what the mechanics of sales and benefits to ratepayers will be. Every single issue we expressed concern about in connection with the Maritime Link deal is now addressed in the new arrangement.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the new and improved deal surrounding this project is good for Nova Scotians. The URB has given the Maritime Link the green light and now we will move the project toward completion with the necessary legislation. This is just one more step toward ensuring that Maritime Link benefits Nova Scotians for decades to come. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand and speak for a few moments on Bill No. 10. As we've said before, this caucus has never doubted the value of Muskrat Falls, a project on its own, yet we simply want to stand up for ratepayers and make sure that they are getting the best deal possible.</p>
<p>The project has merit. We celebrated that announcement a couple of years ago already as a win for Nova Scotia, but of course, that hinged on getting a good deal for Nova Scotians, and we're really not sure if that's true just yet.</p>
<p>The $1.5 billion project locks the people of Nova Scotia in for decades to come - for 35 years. At the end of that deal, we just give it to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. That in itself is one that continues to create concern for many Nova Scotians that we've talked to - how can it possibly be that, when ratepayers are spending so much of their money on a project like this, we don't even own it in the end? It's one that doesn't necessarily have an answer coming from either government or Nova Scotia Power at this point, of exactly why that is. Why aren't we required to maintain or keep that asset for the long term?</p>
<p>The commitment was made by a government that was not sure that we weren't - you know, let me read that one again, Mr. Speaker. The commitment made by the government was not one that we were prepared to make without very careful consideration, but time was not permitted by government as this rolled around. In Opposition, the Minister of Energy and the Premier frequently asked the former government how much the Maritime Link would impact power bills, and now they say they'll need a crystal ball to get that answer. That's not good enough, because we continue to speak to Nova Scotians, whether through social media or as we have the opportunity to travel in our communities, and people continue to ask the question, what is this going to cost? Skyrocketing power rates have plagued family budgets for far too long here in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotians do deserve a break.</p>
<p>Now, this bill that we have before us is one to match up in order to allow the federal loan guarantee to flow. It is one that is a full-out requirement. We're not sold that the Muskrat Falls or the Maritime Link is one that is going to continue to ensure that we have low power rates in Nova Scotia. As a matter of fact, by the admissions of the previous government - and we haven't had that backed up by the current government yet - it will mean an increase in your power rates for years to come. So let's hope, all of us together, that the energy coming from Muskrat Falls will hopefully be a little bit cheaper, a little more in line, and one that I hope will create a more stable power system here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that's very important for that loan guarantee, and I guess as it rolls around, we are going to have to support this to make sure that those dollars flow along. So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on Bill No. 10, and I look forward to this moving on to the next step of the process, which is off to the Law Amendments Committee.</p></speech>

<p>Now, I keep hearing from my friend just to my right here about their energy policy and how, you know, what are we going to do? But if you remember in the recent election, the idea was to freeze rates. There was nothing beyond that.</p></speech>

If we freeze somebody's wages, people will try to catch up to it, and all these things. It was an over-simplistic solution - the member had even said - a very difficult thing. I agree that Lower Churchill will give us stable rates, and that's what we've said since the get-go, Mr. Speaker. It's needed. It has to be a very serious, viable piece of our energy portfolio. We agree with that, Mr. Speaker. But the fact is that one thing that all Parties should be able to agree to in this House, from having rotated from the government side and this can go back for many, many years, is there's no simple fix when it comes to your energy costs and your needs. If someone could merely click their heels and have rates drop, there's not a government, there's not a member in here, who wouldn't agree with being able to do that. It's just common sense and a lot of times this Chamber is devoid of that but I think that even we could reach that bar, Mr. Speaker. That's the reality of it.</p>
<p>Until we get to realize that there will be times - and I am sure I'll be one of them, Mr. Speaker - that our partisanship will show, but the reality is, anybody who stands up in this House and says here is the simple solution to our energy needs, is just not talking about things in the real world.</p>
<p>This provides us with an energy source for 35 years out. One would wish that we could do something with this tomorrow. I know the other day the minister was talking about if this was on the go today, well the fact, when the minister talked about that, it was impossible to be on the go today, that would have cost - I think his dollar figure then was like $42 a megawatt. Mr. Speaker, those things aren't there.</p>
<p>The energy solution for this province is a long game. It's a marathon, it's not a sprint. Therefore, with those few words, Mr. Speaker, we will support this going forward, understanding that this is a very difficult file and we hope the government does well in this and we hope that because if they do well in this, Nova Scotians will do well in this. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from><p>I rise today to move second reading of Bill No. 12, the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians want their workplaces to be safe, and they're eager to assist in making them so. Workplace safety fines are part of making this happen, but they need to be consistent and they need to be fair. We know employers and employees want the administrative penalty system to focus on serious and repeat offenders, and for education to be an important part of the process. During consultations, two of the biggest concerns that were noted were how the funds were spent and how penalties are appealed. We listened and we're making these changes to protect workers and keep workplaces safe.</p>
<p>The Occupational Health and Safety Act will be amended to change the process to appeal penalties, with the Labour Board now hearing all appeals - this includes compliance orders and administrative penalties. We're also changing how we spend the fines collected from these penalties - the money will no longer go into general revenue as they have done since 2010; in fact now they will go towards initiatives that will help make workplaces safer, as opposed to general revenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, keep in mind this isn't all we're doing. These two changes are just the first steps in rolling out the new administrative penalty system. In July the proposed framework for the new system was presented to Nova Scotians and we'll be making these changes happen through new regulations in the new year. The new system will help educate employers and employees on workplace safety and will assign penalties for the appropriate types of offences, and it will focus on the most serious infractions and repeat offenders. We're stepping up our safety efforts in many ways: we're hiring more safety inspections; we're working with industry to ensure officers are getting to more high-risk workplaces; and we're improving documentation and following up on compliance orders.</p>
<p>This is all in an effort to make our province the safest place to work in Canada, because, Mr. Speaker, everyone should come home safe from work. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#71280477-3de0-4cef-90bd-e23864226ad3"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the House to speak to the amendments to Bill No. 12, the Occupational Health and Safety Act. This bill would be some help in putting us in the right direction to many of the challenges we are facing on work sites around this province.</p>
<p>Directing revenue generated by the workplace safety violations to the workplace safety initiative is a good preventive measure to put in place. Certainly prevention is an area where much improvement is needed. Our province is facing many challenges in our workplaces in workplace safety, and workplace safety should be at the top of our priority list. No one should have to go to work wondering if they will be able to make it home at the end of the day to have dinner with their family.</p>
<p>The number of workplace fatalities so far this year is staggering. There have been 28 workplace-related deaths in Nova Scotia this year alone. Most recently, Mr. Speaker, this Fall we lost 21-year-old Alan Fraser who fell six stories to his death on a Clayton Park work site. Sadly, the same site saw an accident the week before when a 25-year-old man pouring concrete fell from the sixth floor - he only fell about 10 feet or so, hurting his leg in the process. This would lead one to believe that we can, and must, do better.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this change to the OHS Act will assist with the issue - there is clearly much more that needs to be done to protect Nova Scotian workers and improve the workplace safety culture in this province. In May 2013, the previous minister said that the government would accelerate a plan to hire a safety prosecutor to deal with the overwhelming number of workplace safety infractions. He said at the time it would likely happen within a month. Well, many months and a new government later, we still do not have the safety prosecutor in place.</p>
<p>What we have seen from the new minister is progress on recommendations from the Workplace Safety Strategy launched earlier this year. Five new investigators will be hired, making the total number of inspectors and investigators 40. This new bill will hopefully improve the appeal process and allow for a more efficient and productive processing of administrative penalties. This will all help, but certainly more needs to be done to change the culture and it will need to involve all Nova Scotians in that process.</p>
<p>It's important that education and preventive programs and much more be inserted into changing this culture. Unfortunately, changing culture takes time. Workplaces that have repeated incidents, especially those with serious accidents resulting in death, need to be held more accountable and then closely monitored to ensure compliance. It is imperative that we have a safety prosecutor in place to ensure that companies are accountable and realize there are serious penalties to providing unsafe working conditions. This is extremely important, and time is of the essence.</p>
<p>In May, there was discussion of expediting the process. Since then, 15 more Nova Scotians have lost their lives on the job site. In my own constituency of Pictou Centre, the Pictou County Injured Workers Association has been critical of the government for a lack of action on the prosecutor front. We cannot wait any longer for workers to be put at risk without holding the workplaces accountable.</p>
<p>We also need to address the prevention side of work public safety. Some have suggested a safety ombudsman or expanding the powers of the current ombudsman to investigate reoccurring workplace complaints and issues. As of right now, there is a confidential government 1-800 number for employees or employers to call should they want to report a violation. An ombudsman would be another avenue to report concerns in your workplace.</p>
<p>Today there was an article on allnovascotia.com examining the circumstances around the death of a 50-year-old shipyard worker who sadly took his own life. I'll table that. There were allegations of bullying within the workplace. The company did investigate the allegations and stated that, "&#x2026; bullying wasn't a factor in Mackenzie's death and the company has looked into allegations of intimidation and harassment and taken disciplinary action." The article called for an investigation by the provincial Department of Labour and Advanced Education, to conduct anonymous interviews and clear the air about the working conditions at the shipyard. It may find that changes are needed in the workplace culture at the shipyard before the heavy lifting on the combat ship contract begins. The article raises some interesting points when it comes to the safety of our workers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the commonality between these suggestions is that changes to workplace safety need to be made. This should be a priority for the government and they need to address the bigger picture of prevention and prosecution to protect all Nova Scotian workers. This bill seems to be a step in the right direction for workplace safety and we are interested in hearing from presenters at the Law Amendments Committee.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Cape Breton Centre.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for bringing this forward. We will be supporting the bill. I don't know what's new in it in some ways, but anything that inches even worker safety forward we would support. There are some issues when it comes to the idea of getting more inspectors and the fines and so on because this is more from words, I would hope, of caution than of criticism. I would hate to see inspectors turn out to be ticket writers as opposed to people who really help with workplace safety. They are the front line for working men and women in this province, to keep them safe.</p>
<p>The idea in other areas, when these - I guess that's an issue that I bring up, because on its face it looks good when you say that those fines will be going into certain programs and not into general revenue. Sometimes those things have to be - I don't know if it's thought through completely or not. That would be a cautionary note from me. The fact that as it sits now, some of our programs as they relate to OH&amp;S are jointly sponsored, if you will, by the department and by WCB's accident fund. Has the department sat down with WCB and asked them to perform an expanded role here in the prevention of workplace accidents? Are we saying the reality is that more and more we see accidents happening in the workplace, in businesses that are not covered by WCB, and would universal coverage be of value in there?</p>
<p>I also would hasten to note that one wonders if we're going to hire new inspectors, but also that the department will be under the 1 per cent cut, so I wonder how that kind of evens out with one another.</p>
<p>The idea of workplace safety is one that we as politicians can talk about in here - the minister would know from the recent campaign that's going on, and it's all about returning home safely. I want to congratulate the minister and the staff on those ads. To my mind, she and I have some of the same background at one time, and I think we agree with the effectiveness of that advertising. It's to that point that we can't lose sight of what government's role is here, and that is to protect the women and men in the workplace. We need to make sure that every workplace is as safe as possible.</p>
<p>I've been involved in enough collective bargaining sessions, and I remember two things that were told to me during my first go-round with collective bargaining by a mentor out of Montreal. He said, when the employer says it's not about the money, it's about the money, and that there's no such thing as an unsafe worker, there's just an unsafe workplace.</p>
<p>We have to make sure that when the inspectors go in, they are looking for the real thing also. I'm sure the minister is aware. What we need is to get at the root of the problem. For instance, if someone had a low bottle of eyewash, should we give them a citation or should we just say, look, get it fixed? That's common sense. But if someone has open wire hanging down and someone could get flashed out, that's serious. I know the folks, the inspectors, and they do a good job.</p>
<p>They need the tools. That's all they ask for, the proper tools to do it. It's impossible to think that we could hire enough inspectors to cover every workplace. We have quite a few police officers in this province but crimes still happen, that's just the reality. Again, as one chap I worked with years ago once told me, locks only keep out honest people, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>The idea is that the inspectors cannot prevent every accident from happening but I would think, given the proper tools, they will prevent many of them and, with education, we will prevent even more. Once we get a culture in this province that every workplace has to be as safe as possible, that's when it will be a success, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I wish the government well with this bill. More importantly, I wish - as the member for Pictou Centre just quoted about the amount of workplace deaths this year - that we can stand in our place next year and he says you know what, I stood in here this time last year and said 28, this year it was zero. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#6918f31d-8900-4400-a42c-b0374b14b8ff"><from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to rise to share an idea with the minister today. I was going to wait until I got to that side of the House but who knows if that will happen so I might as well share it now and, if it helps, it's good for everybody.</p>
<p>The idea is this - and I think this would be smiled upon by everybody in the workplace - the idea is why don't we start calling these people who are going in from the government, why don't we call them safety facilitators instead of having them go in as enforcement officers or inspectors. It may help, if our goal is to reduce injury and death in the workplace, having people come on the site who are there for employers, so the employer feels they are there to work with them, to help them. I think it creates a better atmosphere. If the goal is to reduce the number of injuries and deaths, I think it would have greater impact.</p>
<p>I want to share that today with you. I don't know where it will go from here but hopefully it may be of some assistance. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I do want to commend the members opposite who spoke on this particular bill. I know they all came with good ideas and great thought. I did want to update some of the members on some of the points they raised. We continue to work towards having a prosecutor in place. Of course the Public Prosecution Service is arm's length from government, so while we can move things towards getting a prosecutor, it will not be a prosecutor from the Department of Labour and Advanced Education, it is the Public Prosecution Service that actually has the prosecutor but we are close, I believe, to having that in place.</p>
<p>In terms of what happened at Irving last week, I did offer to meet with the workers. In fact, I was here waiting to meet with them on the first day. In the end, they decided not to but that offer still stands and should they feel they need to meet with me, that they want to bring any safety concerns to my attention, that offer still stands.</p>
<p>The member for Cape Breton Centre said he didn't know what was new in the bill. One of the things that is new, of course, is that the money is not going into general revenue and, in consultations with stakeholders, the stakeholders were unanimous. Every single one of them said that this should not be a cash grab, this money should be going to workplace safety initiatives. That's what we have committed to and that is what we are doing, what we are making possible by passing this particular legislation.</p>
<p>The member for Cape Breton Centre also asked if the Workers' Compensation Board was consulted. In fact, the Workers' Compensation Board was consulted on this bill and they were in the room when the bill briefing took place. So, yes, they were consulted.</p>
<p>I do want to thank Nova Scotians for their commitment to having safer workplaces. One of the things that the tragic incident in Clayton Park had the effect of was to concentrate Nova Scotians on what a tragedy and how unnecessary that was. I think for all of us, all of us who have, you know, kids who are in their early twenties or older or younger, all of us could put ourselves in the place of those parents that day, getting the call about their son. I can tell you it took place just as I was speaking as the minister for the first time, opening a safety conference. When I came down off the stage, I found out that in fact the accident had been a fatality and that it was a young person. I can tell you that, as the mom of a 23-year-old, I felt that very keenly.</p>
<p>I want to thank the members opposite for their comments. I want to thank Nova Scotians who have responded to our commercials. We've been hearing actually a lot about them. I was at a dinner earlier this week and I can't tell you the number of people who came up to me and said, I really love those new commercials. There's a little bit of tension - you're not sure if it's going to be one of those ones where somebody drops the phone or whatever, but it underlines why we want people to come home safe from work. Whether it's to their family, or their friends, or their dog, we all have a reason to want to come home safe from work.</p>
<p>With that, Mr. Speaker, I now move that we close debate on second reading of Bill No. 12.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#980981f9-4823-4d4b-8134-a47d4ecf5405"><from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to stand in this historic Legislature and give the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I have been given the great honour by the residents of Chester-St. Margaret's to represent them as their Member of the Legislative Assembly for a second time.</p>
<p>In 2009, I ran provincially for the very first time, so winning was exciting and a bit nerve-racking. I know that many of the first-time members here today know what I'm speaking about. Added to my new life was the honour of being appointed the Minister of Community Services, Minister of Seniors, Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act, and Minister responsible for the Disabled Persons Commission Act. The learning curve was steep and the speed to step up to the plate was fast.</p>
<p>I was determined to give 110 per cent because I was given the privilege and trust by the people of Chester-St. Margaret's and to represent all Nova Scotians as a member of the Executive Council. My life's path into provincial politics has not been a journey that I have taken on my very own. My husband Wayne, and our son Brandon, who is 21 years of age, have been right by my side, along with my parents, Olaf and Patricia Peterson, all from Chester. My oldest brother, Derek, also has worked and still works hard to keep me informed on the local "Timmy-talks" from Tim Hortons.</p>
<p>Family means everything to me. When I lost the love and support of my other brother, Darryl, when two years ago at the age of 52, he died from a massive heart attack, it was very devastating to me and my family. I miss him dearly and I know, though, that he's following me on my journey.</p>
<p>Each step I have taken to become an MLA and to do my job has been guided by an active and supportive constituency association. I truly appreciate all they have done and the hundreds of hours they have given to me. I also want to express my gratitude to my friends, acquaintances, and community members who have offered their time and support to me as their MLA. During the recent election, I was humbled by the number and the diversity of those who donated their time, their finances, and resources to my re-election. It is a very humbling experience and I know that those in the House today feel the same way when people come together to support you.</p>
<p>I have lived in the Chester area all of my life. I've been very fortunate that my husband and I were some time ago able to purchase my nan's home and to be able to renovate it. That is why I've had the privilege to be in the Chester area and to work in Chester, along with work at one point for Halifax County and then Halifax Regional Municipality.</p>
<p>Chester-St. Margaret's, as many of you know, is an absolutely beautiful constituency starting at Bayside and travelling around from the beautiful community of Bayside to the East and West Dovers. The scenic route is breathtaking. Then you take a trip into, of course, Peggy's Cove, where you see the icon of Nova Scotia and Canada, and that is the Peggy Cove's lighthouse.</p>
<p>Continuing on our trip throughout Chester-St. Margaret's takes us to small communities like Glen Haven, Seabright - and along that route, once again, the beauty is just breathtaking when you look at the ocean. We know many, many people that have worked and lived by the ocean and made it a part of their lives. In fact, my grandmother on my father's side is from Tancook Island and so I have a close connection to Tancook. It's interesting when you look back into your family history and you just see the different cultures coming together. In fact, my grandmother married a gentleman from Sweden. You would never think there would ever be a love story of a lady from Little Tancook Island meeting up with a fine gentleman from the Country of Sweden. (Interruption) My colleague is asking me what the story is about. But it was quite a love story - there was a 13-year difference in their ages, my grandfather was older than my grandmother, but boy, it was quite a love story.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate that I had the opportunity, as a little girl, to grow up by the ocean. My grampie and my gram did have a little cottage on the water, so I spent many hours fishing off the wharf, catching eels, and going out on the boat with my grandfather, on his Cape Islander and fishing with him. He often sang a little song, saying: Fishie, fishie in the brook, come and bite on Essie's hook. I'll never forget those words from my grandfather from Sweden. Of course his name was Eric, and hence Peterson.</p>
<p>On my mother's side we have a combination of Captain Timothy Houghton, who was one of the first discoverers of the Chester area. He is one of the first captains who sailed in. In fact, a lot of people do not know this story, but the Village of Chester was saved by women. What they did is there's a huge hill that looks over the ocean - and I'm sure the future will be the same, in terms of women saving this province and the rest of Canada and the world. (Applause) Thank you very much to my women colleagues - what the women did, because the men were off doing their thing at the time and there were very few men in the village, and there was an attack that was going to take place. I believe it was a French ship at that time.</p>
<p>There's a huge hill that they call the Blockhouse. The women were very quick in their thinking, and what they did is they took their red capes - they were red on the inside and black on the outside - and they flipped them around quickly, they took their broomsticks and they marched up and down the hill so the enemy actually thought it was the military and they left, and I think they went over and actually attacked Lunenburg.</p>
<p>It's quite a story and actually part of my history because of the Houghton family, one of the Houghton women was involved in that, so my heritage goes back to the English culture.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact, I have a family member who had been very much involved in our family tree, and she has gone back many, many centuries and there are actually two famous people on our family tree. One is Katherine Hepburn, because she used to be a Houghton before she was Katherine Hepburn - and this one will get some giggles from you, the other one, and I'm sorry my hair is not long enough and I will not do this anyway, it was Lady Godiva, but I have no desire to ride a horse in the fashion that she did.</p>
<p>On the other side, my grandmother from the Houghton side, actually married into the French culture, a gentleman from Quebec, so there's quite a mixture inside of me and I think that's what makes for being an interesting individual. I'm very proud of my family and my family's history, and I'm very proud that as a person who grew up in the Chester area that I'm able to represent such a beautiful constituency.</p>
<p>As we talk about our travels, you know you look at also the Tantallon-St. Margarets Bay area that is just booming, growing rapidly, and the community is working very hard to deal with that growth. There's a lot of volunteerism; there's a group like the St. Margaret's Bay Stewardship Association. They put a lot of effort in to make sure that, as the growth is expanded from the city to that area, there's planning from all levels, from the municipal level right through to the provincial level.</p>
<p>Along our tour - and I will call it a sight and taste sensation tour, because that was a program that I was proud to initiate as a tourism program when I worked many years ago for Halifax County. It was called sight and taste sensation, where you travelled through the Chester-St. Margaret's Bay constituency area and stopped into businesses to look at the products and have a look at the beautiful sights, stop in restaurants, and have a taste of the lovely cuisine.</p>
<p>As you travel through the constituency, each and every little community along the way was part of that and very much a wonderful place to experience. It brings me to the Hubbards area. Many people here know of the Shore Club - I can see some heads going up and down - and the fact that there were many dances there, parties there, lobster suppers.</p>
<p>In fact, a couple of years before Jack Layton's death I had the privilege of having Jack and Olivia stay at my dad's cottage, that used to be my grandmother's from Tancook. We went to the Shore Club for a lobster supper, and boy, could Jack and Olivia dance together in fine fashion. When Jack passed away it was very, very hard, I know, on many of us in Nova Scotia and throughout Canada. He set a standard that we need to be working to meet each and every day, especially us in this House as political people, and to remember the dream he had and what he talked about in terms of working together, of loving and respecting each other rather than hating and fighting with each other. Hopefully we'll be able to make sure those words ring for many, many years in the future, in Nova Scotia and the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>Off from Hubbards we'll take a little trip now going around what we call Aspotogan Peninsula, the Blandford area and the Bayswater area. In fact, many people don't realize it, but there is a monument to the Swissair crash in Bayswater, because that's where the remains of those who lost their lives on that flight are buried.</p>
<p>I can remember that night so distinctly. My husband and I had just gone to bed - it was probably about 10 p.m. or 10:15 p.m. - and we could hear this real loud noise go over our house, and we were just wondering, it sounded like a train wreck, and we're going, what would that be? It wasn't long after that we heard all the sirens and hopped out of bed and discovered the terrible tragedy that took place. We also knew many of the fishers who went out to recover and to work, to help others in that terrible, terrible situation. Some of those people have never been the same. They gave in an instant, and in that instant their lives have been affected ever since.</p>
<p>It is a lovely monument, so if you haven't had the opportunity to go to the monument it will bring tears to your eyes. When you stand there you'll see some tattered old flowers and some tattered old teddy bears that were left in memory of some of the children. But it is a good opportunity to go and say a couple of prayers and to realize just how precious life is, and that each and every moment that we have to be in this world and to help others is one that we should be very grateful for. I do know that each and every one of you in here understand that, or you wouldn't be in here. What you're doing and what you're trying to accomplish to help others is not an easy job.</p>
<p>Around the Aspotogan Loop it's another very scenic view, a wonderful community - a lot of community spirit in the smaller communities on the South Shore of Nova Scotia. As you take that trip and then you eventually get into Chester. I know a lot of people recognize Chester, especially for the fine homes that are there, the diversity of the people and some of the people who live in the community of Chester such as Mr. Risley of Clearwater and Colin MacDonald from Clearwater. Colin was a wonderful support for me during the election. He actually bought the old liquor store in Chester to put some of his antique cars in and he allowed me to use it during the election.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people - the old liquor store has been closed for maybe a couple of years but every day we got a few people driving in wondering where the liquor store was. Part of our election campaign was to address their needs and tell them where they needed to find the new liquor store.</p>
<p>Chester has a lot of diversity and has a lot of needs also. When you put those combinations together, it gives you a real diversity from those who do not have very much, to those who are extraordinarily wealthy. Chester is also known for Race Week. Although I grew up in the area and spent a lot of time on the Cape Island boats doing the fishing, I never had the opportunity to do much in the area of sailing. I'm sure there are some people here who are sailors. I can't imagine if you're a sailor that you didn't have the opportunity to actually be involved in Chester Race Week because the whole village just explodes with a lot of fun and parties.</p>
<p>As you travel through Chester-St. Margaret's and go towards the communities of Chester Basin, we go out past Canaan and towards Windsor where you have a few more farming communities along with the New Ross area. I was extremely pleased and felt very honoured with the fact that, as the representative for Chester-St. Margaret's, I was able to help the Ross Farm with part of a dream that they were trying to accomplish for over 10 years and that was to start building towards having a learning centre. What it will be is a centre that will provide people with the opportunity to learn the old ways, the old crafts. You'll be able to learn how to cook from centuries ago, you'll be able to learn how the clothing was made.</p>
<p>A lot of people don't know that the Ross Farm does a lot of work on movie sets. When it's a historical movie set, they will make props for the movies. I also missed when I was talking about Hubbards, we have - and I had the privilege to be involved in this also and that's the opening of the North American Rug Museum. I know people often kind of think, a rug museum, that couldn't be very interesting but I encourage each and every one of you, if you have the opportunity to travel with your family, please go see the rug museum. It has hooked rugs that are just incredible, they look like pictures - when you look at them, you have to look twice.</p>
<p>There is one piece there that's absolutely incredible. It is a huge Noah's Ark that was given by a rug association in Ontario. All the little animals are hooked to look three-dimensional. It's unbelievable to even to see. It's hard for me to describe it so you really need to stop in and see it. What they've also done to help the community is to continue that craft and they'll involve students and they also bring in senior women who may be widowed and do not have a lot in their lives but they get the opportunity to make a little bit of money on the side plus be able to interact and socialize with other people.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, also in New Ross, a lot of people do not know there's a new winery there called Muwin Estate Winery and the wine is fabulous and it is sold in our liquor stores throughout Nova Scotia - not in all of them so sometimes you have to be searching for it. They send a great deal of their product, actually, to Japan.</p>
<p>Lots of times we have these hidden treasures that we do not even know are in our backyard, so I think it's important, as a MLA, to encourage our own community members to travel within and to encourage Nova Scotians to take the opportunity to travel.</p>
<p>The far end of my constituency takes you through Chester Basin, right through to the communities of Gold River, where we have an Aboriginal community. I had the pleasure, in September, to go to an Aboriginal event that was just incredible. They danced for hours. They were in their authentic costumes. Everybody was welcomed. They provided you with the opportunity to learn about the Aboriginal culture. You had an opportunity to taste some of the foods that are authentic, especially moose meat.</p>
<p>I have to tell you, I do like moose meat; I have no problem with moose meat. It depends on how it is cooked.</p></speech>

          <p>Best hamburger in the world.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#980981f9-4823-4d4b-8134-a47d4ecf5405"><from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Yes, the best hamburger because there's not a lot of fat in it. And deer, although I have a little bit of a hard time with picturing the image of little Bambi and then eating the deer, but I do. I don't like when I see the deer, though, on top of the trucks because my dad used to hunt and when I originally went out with my husband, he used to hunt. We dated 13 years before I got married to him and now we've been married 25 years. It took a while to prepare him for life with me.</p>
<p>I did good because when I won the first election, I said to him, dear, I really should be able to give you something for all your support. This is a hard-working man who works at a hardboard plant, Louisiana Pacific. He's worked there for 25 years. He loves NASCAR; he doesn't have a political bone in his body. He loves doing landscaping but he's a bit of a neat freak, which is no problem for me because what he asked for was a Dyson vacuum cleaner and I bought him a yellow Dyson vacuum cleaner. They didn't have any orange but I bought him a yellow one. Do you know what, ladies? I'm not allowed to touch it. Isn't that nice? I'm not allowed to touch it. He takes that vacuum cleaner out - and I hope the men are listening to this - he takes that vacuum cleaner out and I think he even waxed the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>He doesn't permit me to do too much housework, which I'm not going to complain about because when we originally moved into nan's house, I was so excited that we were in my grandmother's house. You know how strange life can be because the night my grandmother passed away was the night that I actually got pregnant with my only son, and we couldn't have any more children, and it's like a miracle to me that she left the world and I became pregnant and at the end of the day we ended up in nan's house, living.</p>
<p>We renovated the whole house and there was one spot in particular where nan always had her rocking chair. One day I said to my husband, oh my goodness, we put a rocking chair in the exact spot. Nothing else in the house would have fit anywhere else, because of the fact that we just totally changed it. The rocking chair was actually Wayne's grandfather's rocking chair because nan's rocking chair was given to my brother. My grandmother knew my husband's grandfather, so it is funny how all that comes together.</p>
<p>You probably remember the times when - you know, my grandmother did this, she painted everything. Paint was the big thing and we love all this beautiful woodwork and my grandmother painted everything. I don't know how many coats of paint were on the beautiful staircase in the house. There were so many coats that we ended up having to actually burn it off. I was so proud of that beautiful wood that I thought I would impress my husband by "Pledging" the stairs. Well, that did not work. I'll tell you, when I heard that "boom, bang, boom, bang, ouch," I knew it was from "Pledging" the stairs, kind of making it a little slippery. They looked beautiful, and he didn't kill himself, and I did tell him I had all of his life insurance paid up. We do those kinds of things in life, but when you have a partner for that long and you've dated them for 13 years and been married to them for 25 years, we're almost like Archie and Edith now.</p>
<p>The one thing I think that has gotten us through all of the turmoil and the difficulties in life is having respect for each other. At the end of the day we can laugh with each other and we can laugh at each other and we have respect. That's what I do hope that we can carry on within these walls as we do our jobs. I know that it gets tough - and I'm the worst one. I think you've already heard my heckling skills. I try very hard, but I'll just let you know it doesn't work. My husband hasn't succeeded, so I don't think anybody in here will succeed, but I will now formally let you know that I do have a challenge with heckling. But I think you already know that.</p>
<p>I have to say that it has been such an interesting life for me, and that I am so proud that I represent Chester-St. Margaret's. One of the things that I did learn very quickly, and that was the same as my new colleague on the government side, the member for Lunenburg, was the importance of roads, roads, roads. I do know my former colleague from Lunenburg, Pam Birdsall, knew that too, and worked very hard to make sure that a lot of the roadwork was done - and roads that normally didn't get any attention. I do remember a time when we met with the Christmas Tree Growers Association, and there's a road called Stanburn Road that was in terrible shape. They weren't able to get access to the trees, so they were very concerned about that. Pam worked very hard to make sure the standard of that road was changed.</p>
<p>I worked very hard on the road file, and was able to have about $28 million in road improvements put in Chester-St. Margaret's over the four and a half years in government. I do know that my friend on the other side who is in charge of TIR knows where I'm going with this. I'm not going to heckle, I'm just going to say that I do really wish there was a reconsideration in terms of the asphalt plant. I know we have different opinions on that, but I saw roads in Chester-St. Margaret's being paved that didn't see a touch of pavement in over 50-some years. I truly believe that having that asphalt plant set up as standard - because I know what was happening, and I know many people know what was happening years before we had that plant. The fact is that there was really no competition in the road paving industry in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>There was one major company, and I don't need to say their name. I know you know who they are, because the owner lives in the Chester area. As companies will do, it's their job to make the most money that they can; that's why they're an entrepreneur. The tenders that were coming in were higher than necessary and there was no competition to encourage them to lower those tender numbers. I do know that by having that asphalt plant, that set up a whole different circumstance in our province. It did encourage other competition to come in, and the reason it did is because now that particular company that had basically had a monopoly on road paving, suddenly they were lowering their prices, and because they were lowering their prices, the other companies now could compete. So that's the real story behind the asphalt plant. You didn't even have to start that plant up because it created a whole different environment for the paving industry. I believe the business case that we presented showed that there was a saving of $50,000 or $51,000 per kilometre. So it makes sense that you were able to take those extra dollars and reinvest in other areas.</p>
<p>One of the other areas that we reinvested in too was the chip sealing, and that's why the chip sealing crew was so important. I had so many roads chip sealed. It is a wonderful product because those roads that used to be sand sealed - sand sealing is so expensive. So it was an option there for us to be able to have these roads chip sealed. There were many, many roads in Chester-St. Margaret's that were chip sealed and people were extraordinarily pleased with that.</p>
<p>So, you know, I really do encourage the minister to take another look rather than it being, okay, we were on this side, when we were over there, we're NDP, we're Liberal. Now because it was an NDP's thing, we don't want it. I really do hope that, I know that the Liberal Party said they are going to do things differently. So if they're going to do things differently, I hope they would take that political part out and really have a hard look, because we will find out in four and a half years who's right on this one, believe me, because roads are critical in rural Nova Scotia. We'll be able to see at the budget process of where that saving is because, once again, I think we have created a situation in the province that it will be difficult for those smaller road-paving companies now to compete again.</p>
<p>That's why some of our roads in very rural areas weren't getting done either: because of the fact that the larger company just did not want to put in a bid. It wasn't worth it for them to move their equipment and all the work when they knew there were many greater projects at their fingertips that they could get, so that was ignored. So I really do encourage you to have more discussions about that.</p>
<p>One other area that I would like to focus on that I didn't see a lot about in the Throne Speech, which really does concern me because of my recent role as Minister of Community Services, and that's with respect to many areas in that department and certainly for persons with disabilities, Madam Speaker. We worked very, very hard to move that whole file along and to help those individuals and families who have disabilities. I have to be honest.</p>
<p>When I went in as minister, I was quite surprised at how neglected that area was. There was not a whole lot of investment. What we were looking at was a province where people with disabilities have been working so hard and have the desire to be able to live in their communities. People with disabilities, I often would say, are actual people with abilities; people with disabilities have the ability to teach us. They teach us what's really important in life. They teach us how to be motivated. They teach us how to not give up.</p>
<p>So I don't want your new minister, or the new government, to give up when it comes to people with disabilities. It took a while for us to get the strategy in place, and the reason for that is there was always a distinction between the advocacy groups standing outside, looking in the window of Community Services. And they were not invited in. The reason being - it's just a part of - it wasn't staff's fault, it was the way we developed over hundreds of years of government to create a system. That system is what I as a minister always blamed the problems on; not the people, not the staff, but the system. It's really hard to change a system if you don't go to the root cause, and often the root cause in government is policies, and policies that are 20 and 30 years behind.</p>
<p>So I do encourage you to take a hard look at those policies and make every effort to change them. One of the other tasks that I had was now to bring people together in a restorative approach and start talking around the table. I was absolutely surprised how many people said to me we've never been invited into the minister's office. That takes time, trust had to be rebuilt and trust only can be rebuilt if you show action.</p>
<p>One of the major, major projects with those with a disability that we took upon ourselves was to work with the disabled community - those people who used to rally outside, yell at government, saying they weren't being heard - and bring professionals to the table, people like Michael Kendrick who wrote a report over 10 years ago about the issues in this province, about not having enough infrastructure to allow people to live in their community and to deinstitutionalize this province for those with disabilities. And so he came to the table, and a gentleman called Michael Bach, who is world renowned on working on how communities and governments can plan and finance for those changes to allow opportunities for people to live in community.</p>
<p>That is the struggle that you will face that we faced, and that is that the infrastructure is not there because there was no planning in the past. When we announced the transition and the pathway for people with disabilities to support every effort to build more infrastructure to allow communities to have people living in and having choice - it's all about choice. That's what we worked and that pathway and that strategy I hope, I really hope, that you will continue and you will continue the financial aspect and planning for that because it would be such a shame after all that work and coming together that that would be lost.</p>

<p>So I have to bring up my concern that I didn't see a lot in the Throne Speech around that commitment for people with disabilities and continuing on that path of deinstitutionalization. It's not an easy path to take, but for the first time in the province's history you've brought together every group that had an interest in this. We brought together parents, and we brought together people who have disabilities and we, with staff, developed a new relationship - and I hope that relationship doesn't get broken and I hope that that relationship continues with the commitment for that strategy.</p>
<p>The other strategy that I'm very proud of is the Housing Strategy and that was the first housing strategy that this province ever created. I don't want to sound like we're bragging but it was a lot of hard work and that, once again, was bringing partnerships together. The focus on that strategy was we had four different pillars and the pillars were looking at the need for more partnerships with municipalities, with the province, with the federal government. We looked at homelessness and we had started a program where we supported outreach workers. They worked very diligently with people who were homeless and we were able to find homes for 280-some people within an 18-month period.</p>
<p>The other part of that strategy focuses on seniors and what we can do, and what now you can do, to make sure there are programs and opportunities for seniors to stay in their homes as long as possible. Another major part was looking at what I was just talking about, and that was deinstitutionalization and allowing for us to go forward with more infrastructure so people do have an opportunity to say, I would like to live in my own home community where my mom and dad live and not be shipped off miles away.</p>
<p>I know this will be challenging because it's going to be challenging for you in terms of budget. I was very concerned to see that to take 1 per cent out of Community Services actually equates to almost $10 million. I was happy that the minister said that it would not be taken out on the backs of the people who the department supports. I will watch that, and I know that Nova Scotians will watch that, and will watch to see if people will lose their jobs because when people lose their jobs it also means that those supports are going to create detrimental situation with those supports.</p>
<p>There are many things we can do. We are here to represent the people of Nova Scotia and we are here to take action. We often say that actions are louder than words, so here's another little suggestion I have that will really show the people of Nova Scotia that you will take action and that you will do things differently and change.

          <heading>LYME DISEASE: ISSUE - RECOGNIZE</heading>
          <speech by="#71280477-3de0-4cef-90bd-e23864226ad3"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Madam Speaker, most Nova Scotians enjoy walking, jogging, camping, fishing, hunting in the woods and parks of Nova Scotia. In some areas of Nova Scotia, citizens have to be conscious of the blacklegged tick. We have many types of ticks in Nova Scotia, but only the blacklegged tick carries the bacteria that can cause Lyme disease. Citizens are told to use preventive measures.</p>
<p>Some of the areas that are well known for blacklegged ticks carrying Lyme disease are areas like Lunenburg, Shelburne, Queens, Yarmouth, Halifax area and Pictou County. Preventive measures that have been mentioned to residents of Nova Scotia are things like wearing light-coloured clothing, pulling socks over pant legs, wearing pants and long sleeved shirts, spraying clothing and many others.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, there have been 150 confirmed cases where Lyme disease was contracted in Nova Scotia. In 2012 alone, there were 50 cases reported. Doctors Nova Scotia indicates that the number of cases is expected to grow over time. Too many Nova Scotians are unaware of the dangers associated with tick bites and it is not well communicated when spikes occur in the blacklegged tick population.</p>
<p>I would like to see the government take a proactive approach to notifying the public about the possible dangers. I am sure most, if not all, members of this House would agree with a proactive approach. I know that in Opposition, the now Minister of Labour and Advanced Education pushed the previous government to be proactive on how to combat ticks and what to do if they are bitten.</p>
<p>People that start experiencing neurological symptoms, memory problems, digestive issues, migraines and other forms of chronic pain are sometimes infected by the blacklegged tick. Lyme disease will cause a host of different symptoms and it is important that patients receive the proper treatment. Chronic Lyme disease complex is known as the "great imitator" and I think therein lies the problem. It can mimic numerous chronic diseases because its symptoms often involve multiple body systems at the same time.</p>
<p>I also have another major concern. It appears many doctors do not possess the comprehensive treatments needed to help patients reach a full recovery. Making the correct full diagnosis involves a series of detailed tests with specialized parameters. There have been many cases of people infected by Lyme disease in this province that I had the opportunity to talk to, and it seems wherever they go there are no answers. In fact, the answers are there's something else wrong with you.</p>
<p>One good example of that is a very young cousin of mine, a young, healthy female. She received a tick bite while she was camping in Ontario. In the ensuing number of years, she went through a multitude of various physicians in Nova Scotia and still continued to get answers that the family were not pleased with. In fact, this young lady was told it was all in her head, that she was having some mental problems, and she was sent to a psychiatrist to have that diagnosed. Later on she did find out she did carry Lyme disease. It is a problem with adults and especially children in campsites and running around the parks, woodlands, and beaches of our communities, especially the ones that are infected by Lyme disease, the high-population areas.</p>
<p>Three years ago in September, my beautiful black Lab came into my house and accidentally I checked him and found a couple of ticks around his neck area. I took the Lab to a veterinarian clinic. They removed the tick and suggested I take it to Natural Resources, which I did. They sent the tick to the lab in Truro, where they in turn identified it as a blacklegged tick and then sent it to a lab in Saskatchewan. I was told at that time in September that if this tick was carrying Lyme disease I would hear back from the lab in Saskatchewan. This was in September. I didn't hear anything, so I assumed everything was okay. The following May I received a letter stating that the tick that was taken from the neck of my pet was carrying Lyme disease.</p>
<p>Again, there are all kinds of examples around the province. I'm sure any member here can stand up and say, I have a neighbour, I have a friend, I have a relative who has had experiences with tick bites carrying Lyme disease.</p>
<p>My colleague for Pictou East has had similar problems in his area with regard to tick bites on his family pets, horses used by many, for riding lessons and so on. It seems to be prevalent in our area. I have a cottage at Melmerby Beach, a beautiful beach area, and my pet does not run loose. Whenever he leaves my house he's on a leash, but he will still invariably pick up a tick or two over the two or three weeks during the summer months.</p>
<p>I can recall many people mentioning to me that they were experiencing problems with blacklegged ticks, and they would go to a doctor in Port Hawkesbury. I was told by them he seemed to be the only person who would address the concerns and perhaps do something about it. I'm not sure how accurate that information is, but it's what I've been told time and time again.</p>
<p>There is a lady in our community who has been suffering from Lyme disease for quite some time. She's a lady from New Glasgow, Brenda Sterling-Goodwin. She is certainly an advocate for people who are suffering from Lyme disease. She has done a considerable amount of research over the last few years and was responsible for taking a doctor into our area to speak to anyone interested. A crowd of about 200 showed up at the Wellness Centre in Pictou County. This particular retired doctor had done extensive research on Lyme disease. The information he relayed to us that night was something that the medical profession, in his opinion, should address and start doing something about not only in Nova Scotia but right across the country. He gave examples where he was chastised for being involved with Lyme disease and basically saying, look, this does happen, this is a problem. We have to start doing something about this. We can't ignore it any longer.</p>
<p>The problem exists, and it's existing in Nova Scotia. I'm standing here tonight hoping that the government will take the proactive approach and do something about it. Thank you, Madam Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Madam Speaker, I do like seeing you in the Chair. I would like to thank the member for Hants West for the topic today on ticks, and also the member for Pictou Centre for his thoughtful remarks around Lyme disease. While the member was away on his sabbatical, involuntary sabbatical as my husband refers to it, having taken one himself - he may not know that I spoke on this topic quite a bit in the last Legislature. In fact, I managed to earn the nickname of the "Bedford Tick" from my colleague, the member for Richmond at the time. So that was my nickname in caucus.</p>
<p>My area, Bedford, is one of the areas that is an epicentre for ticks as well in this province. Back in 2009, when I went door-to-door in one of the neighbourhoods close to my home in fact, I heard about it as I went door-to-door. It certainly was brought home to me when I had two households right next door to each other where the father in the one household had in fact contracted Lyme disease and ended up with neurological symptoms, and then next door a child, I think he was about 8 years old at the time, he was having problems with his knees and they didn't know what was going on. His neighbour said, you know, you might want to get tested for Lyme disease. So he ended up getting tested and in fact he had Lyme disease and that boy will be on, I think it's anti-inflammatories, or anti-arthritics, for the rest of his life as a result of Lyme disease.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about Lyme disease, what a lot of people don't realize, is it depends where the spirochete burrows in your body and that I guess determines what your symptoms are going to be. So if the spirochete goes to your heart, you could have heart symptoms. If it goes to your brain, you'll have neurological. If it goes to your knees, you could have joint problems. So it's a tricky spirochete, and as the member for Pictou Centre mentioned, it depends on where it goes what your symptoms are going to be and it mimics other diseases. That's what makes it so tough for doctors to diagnose.</p>
<p>I also, you know, there has been more education I think in the last few years than there had been previously but I'm still concerned. I still get e-mails from people who say, you know, I was in at emergency, I saw a doctor and they said, oh, Lyme disease, you get that from mosquitoes - and maybe you can somewhere, I don't know, but all I know is I've only heard about ticks. So I'm not convinced that all doctors, all GPs, are getting sort of the message on Lyme disease, and that is a concern.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this year I went and met with Doctors Nova Scotia to urge them to make sure that their members get good education around that particular issue, because it just seems to me it's one of those front-line issues that's easy to miss, and because it mimics so many other things, it's easy for us not to diagnose it properly. One of the things with Lyme disease - I have notes here, oh boy, don't know where they went. It was kind of a busy day. One of the things that I did just before the election was I actually wrote to all the Health Ministers in the four Atlantic Provinces at the behest of the then-Opposition Leader who said that Nova Scotia isn't the only province that is dealing with this right now in Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p>It was actually prompted by something that was sent to me by a constituent, Donna Lugar, who has Lyme disease and is very involved in this. She noted that a member in New Brunswick - not Jody Carr - Jack Carr from New Brunswick, had actually introduced a motion in the House. I think it was around something like: Therefore be it resolved that New Brunswick recognize that Lyme disease is a considerable public health concern - or something like that. I thought that was a significant development because all three Parties came together to, in fact, pass that resolution.</p>
<p>The numbers in New Brunswick are nothing like the numbers here in Nova Scotia but it seems they're being more proactive about it than what I saw here. So I wrote to the Health Ministers of all four provinces. P.E.I. responded first and the minister there said it was going to discuss it with his officials. Newfoundland and Labrador responded next and said they were up for actually having it on the agenda, and that's what I asked for, was to have the Health Ministers put it on their agenda for their next Atlantic Provinces meeting. Then Nova Scotia responded and said that they would bring it to their officials, so I think the officials from the four provinces would start talking.</p>
<p>New Brunswick was last and oddly sort of the least encouraging of the bunch. To me that was a step forward because, for example, in Newfoundland and Labrador they had very few cases but they knew that they have ticks there so they knew that it was only a matter of time before it happened there.</p>
<p>On P.E.I. they didn't appear to have any infected blacklegged ticks there but they were getting cases where people had gone off the island and had, in fact, contracted it somewhere else.</p>
<p>One of the things I've done in my riding in trying to raise awareness about Lyme disease, of course, is we've put information in my newsletter. We did bring in that same doctor that I think you are referring to, even though I took some flack in the House here for it. We had a great turnout for that particular doctor coming in.</p>
<p>We also held viewings of the movie <i>Under Our Skin</i>, which is a movie that you can order on-line. Occasionally they have free viewings on-line as well. It is about Lyme disease. It's good. It's scary. It's a little long, actually. As a former director, I would have chopped it up into bits because it goes off in a bunch of different directions and it's hard to follow, I think. In the end it covers a lot of area, though, so if you really want a Lyme education, it's a good film. You can find it on-line and order it on-line.</p>
<p>I do think that when you have people who come to you and say, I had to go out of province to be diagnosed or I have to go out of province to be treated, that causes me great concern because if you get diagnosed out of province and you get your treatment there, then sometimes what we have seen is that some of our Lyme disease sufferers have had difficulty getting treatment once they get back here. So they might have treatment outside the province but then they come back and their specialist says, I can't see you because you're doing this unauthorized treatment, or something like that. It's bad enough that they're sick and then they have to turn around and deal with this. So that has been a concern for us as well.</p>
<p>I would actually like to take this moment - I know I am almost out of time - but I would like to mention to folks that ticks are still active at this time of year and they will be active until, I think, it has been four days of minus-four degrees or lower. So we need to make sure that people know that ticks are still active, if they're out with their dogs or their kids, and all of the things that the member for Pictou Centre said about covering up and doing the fashion crime of pulling your socks over your pants - those are important when you're out there. I really would encourage anyone who was interested to learn more about it to check the government's Web site on Lyme disease. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's a great pleasure to have an opportunity to participate in this debate this evening on an issue that is certainly very important. It's particularly important, I think, to people who have experienced the symptoms of Lyme disease, having been bitten by one of these blacklegged ticks that carry the disease. As laypeople in this Chamber, we don't necessarily know a lot about the science behind Lyme disease. We rely on people who actually do research and know a fair amount.</p>
<p>I have to say over my time here in this Chamber we have discussed this matter a number of times. At one point I sat in the chair of the Minister of Health and Wellness and had an opportunity to actually talk to people who know way more than I knew or will ever know about infectious diseases, of which Lyme disease is one. Although having said that, I learned a great deal from talking to people who are infectious disease specialists over at the Capital District Health Authority. I also had a friend who was bitten by a blacklegged tick. She lives in the beautiful, beautiful community of Blue Rocks on the South Shore.</p>
<p>People will know that there are three areas off Nova Scotia where blacklegged ticks have been found in sufficient numbers that on a regular basis the Province of Nova Scotia, generally through the Public Health division of the Department of Health and Wellness, put out advisories to people who live or who are travelling in those areas to let them know that these are areas where blacklegged ticks have been identified through a very active surveillance process, that the Department of Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Public Health agency of the province, has conducted.</p>
<p>There have been areas identified in Lunenburg County, of which the community of Blue Rocks, for example, would be one. There are also areas near Melmerby Beach that the member for Pictou Centre has made reference to in Pictou County, and out in Bedford near Admiral's Cove Park. This is not to say that those are the only areas where blacklegged ticks, which carry Lyme disease or the bacteria that will lead to Lyme disease, exist, but these are the areas that have demonstrated in sufficient quantities that it is a concern. But no doubt there are other parts of our province where you need to be vigilant and worry about this.</p>
<p>My friend who was bitten recognized immediately that she had a problem when she had the bulls-eye rash. She presented herself to her general practitioner, her family doctor, who immediately started her on a series of antibacterial pharmaceutical drugs that are designed to treat the bacterial infection. Within a matter of weeks, the rash was gone and everything was fine, and she does not carry or have any symptoms as a result of having prompt treatment.</p>
<p>What I understand is that the difficulty, of course, is if you do not identify that you have been bitten and your symptoms go untreated for some considerable period of time, the impact can be quite dramatic.</p>
<p>When I was Minister of Health and Wellness, I met with, first of all, Doctor Bob Strang, our Chief Medical Officer who, on a regular basis, sends out materials and oversees the production of public information, warnings, and notices that are sent out and distributed through the district health authorities, through the medical officers of health in those district health authorities and, as well, Doctors Nova Scotia whom the member from Bedford made reference to. They provide information to all of their members across the province and that information is constantly being updated, just like information you would receive around adverse reactions to some drugs. As the science evolves the continuing education for physicians evolves.</p>
<p>I think it is very important that we continue to communicate with physicians and with members of the public with respect to where blacklegged ticks have been identified. The Department of Natural Resources, no doubt, will need to continue to do surveillance around the province to identify those hot spots. We need an educated public that is aware of the things they can do to prevent being bitten by ticks. I'm one of these people who not only is paranoid about blacklegged ticks, but just ticks in general are pretty unpleasant so you avoid as much as possible going into tall grass and areas where you don't have your pants stuck into your socks, and things like this. You need to check yourself really, really well after you've been out enjoying nature, which we all should probably do more.</p>
<p>We need to take some personal responsibility; we need also to continue to communicate with the public; we need to educate the public; and we need to support our physicians with good science-based information. We need to be absolutely aware and confident in the infectious disease folks who work here and treat Lyme disease on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of meeting with those physicians and they track the numbers of cases of Lyme disease in the province - and indeed they have grown over the last number of years. Recently I learned that, as the member for Pictou Centre indicated, Lyme disease is something that your pet can contract, and of course that makes sense, and they are our family members, so probably around education and training of veterinarians so that they are able as well to treat our pets.</p>
<p>I think that the sad reality is that with the changing climate and with the movement of some of these insects and other predators, Lyme disease has been well established in the northern U.S.: in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire. It was really a matter of time before we would see it here in Nova Scotia. It's an important topic, and I thank the honourable member from Hants West for bringing it forward.</p></speech>

<p>The honourable member for Chester-St. Margaret's.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#980981f9-4823-4d4b-8134-a47d4ecf5405"><from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I am not going to take too much more time, because I know everybody is hungry here this evening.</p>
<p>As I was saying before, the challenges that the government will face in terms of the expenditures and where monies will be cut and to make sure that any cuts that take place in departments do not affect the people of Nova Scotia directly is going to be quite a challenge. I do know that one thing I was always taught, and I taught my son, was the importance of leading by example. I know that is what the new government has also talked about.</p>
<p>Leading by example means that it is so important for us to show Nova Scotians that actions are louder than words. I know that any of you here who have children, you have said that, and you want to make sure that you're teaching your children, that you set an example for your children. It's very important that we do the same as politicians, that we set examples for all Nova Scotians. We know from knocking on those doors not so long ago how disgusted people are in the political system and see politicians as being elitist and taking every opportunity to fill their pockets. We really do need to work hard to show that that's not the reality, that everyone here dedicates themselves and works long hours. We want to set an example.</p>
<p>I know that the Premier knows that, because - as the Leader of the Official Opposition - he actually said that on August 28<sup>th</sup> when there was the leadership forum at Neptune Theatre. He said that government has to look at itself with expenditures.</p>
<p>I do want to offer a suggestion that when we talk about change - something we did change as the NDP Government was a decision that we did not have to put on paper and force anybody to do. Our Cabinet members did not take any car allowance at all if they were Cabinet members. The car allowance equates to about $700 a month, plus a gas card. That gas card gives you a full tank of gas all the time; that gas card actually gets your oil changed and your tires changed. If people remember, there was quite a bit of kerfuffle around that about five years ago, because there were fleet vehicles. I don't have to go into that long story.</p>
<p>At that time the government of the day made a change by creating an allowance of $700 a month plus that gas card. I am proud to say that I didn't accept it, and our Cabinet members did not accept it, to lead by example to the people of Nova Scotia, so they would know we were serious about knowing how difficult it is for many Nova Scotians to try to decide between having a heated house or putting food on the table for their children.</p>
<p>I encourage the new government to follow the precedent that we set. What we did is we took the mileage coverage that any person working for government would take. I stand in this House tonight, and I encourage you to have that discussion. Please show an example to the rest of Nova Scotia that if the NDP was able to do that and set that precedent, that the new Liberal Government will continue that precedent. Thank you.</p></speech>
