That is surprising considering that just two years ago in talking about a similar audit of another development authority in southwest Nova Scotia the now Premier said, and I quote directly, "These are public assets being managed by a provincial government funded public regional development authority &#x2026; Accountability and transparency must be at the core of all management activities."</p>
<p>I'll table that quote for the benefit of the House. I'd like to ask the Premier, in the spirit of accountability and transparency that he spoke about in Opposition, will he tell the House today whether the auditors doing the forensic audit of CREDA now have all the information they need to conclude their audit, and when might we expect to see the results?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as the honourable member would know, there's an ongoing audit at this point. It's my understanding that the auditors have the information they require. If not, I'm sure they'll ask for any additional information they need.</p>

I will table that quote for the benefit of the House.</p>
<p>Cumberland County residents deserve the same full accountability that the people of Shelburne County were asking for at that time, Mr. Speaker. That includes those who did work for the development authority and are owed money from the development authority. I would like to ask the Premier if he will agree today, in the interest of full accountability, to release a list of all the outstanding creditors of the Cumberland Regional Economic Development Authority, including those that may have been paid since?</p></speech>

What was originally, I would agree, an NDP problem, is now quickly becoming a Liberal problem because they are no better at answering straightforward questions about this audit than the NDP were.</p>
<p>There is no good reason why the people of Nova Scotia, particularly the people of Cumberland County, can't know whether their own taxpayers' money was used to pay off outstanding creditors of CREDA, any and all of them, and there's no reason why they can't know if the audit agency now has all the information it needs and when we can expect to see the results.</p>

JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>As my tenure in the community as executive director, I often wondered what the process was for the Department of Community Services in terms of their discretionary funding to organizations. Now, as minister, I have the ability to look at that process, make sure that organizations give due respect to a crucial funding partner and provide not only annual general reports, which many organizations don't do, but actually follow the outcomes of two questions that I have asked, as minister, which are, quite simply: What is the work you do, and what difference does it make to the people you serve?</p>
<p>Those are two very reasonable questions, and I will be asking them of every organization that receives funding from this department, so that at the end of the day vulnerable Nova Scotians get the best services they deserve and the taxpayers of Nova Scotia have the best use of very scarce funding.</p></speech>

I'd like to ask the minister if she would tell members of the Legislature who is currently being funded but not providing the appropriate services, and would she please table a list of those organizations?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, that is private information that is between the department right now and ongoing with the review with the organizations. I also clearly said in estimates that we would never cut anybody off at the knees, and that we would work with organizations to provide the capacity to be able to develop outcome and evaluation measurements within their organization so that they can tell us what they actually do. Long gone are the days of backroom deals through old boys' networks where organizations are funded and not providing any outcomes or evaluation measurement to government or to the community in which they serve.</p>

These are public funds. These organizations are very concerned now, given what the minister has said is going to be a broad review of their funding. In the interest of transparency and fairness, it seems to me that we have to have this information on the public record. There are many deserving groups that do phenomenal work funded through the Department of Community Services, and these groups are now wondering whether or not they are the organizations that have raised the red flag in the mind of the minister.</p>
<p>I want to ask the minister again, will she please provide for us a list of the organizations that will be reviewed under this process that she has underway in the Department of Community Services?</p></speech>

That's what should be shocking to every member of this House.</p>
<p>I also would like to remind the honourable member that I am an executive director who has won eight national awards on outcome measurement in Canada. So I expect what was provided in my small organization to be extended to the millions of dollars that we provide to organizations. Most organizations provide that now because they are accountable, they are transparent, and they do extraordinary work in the community, and if they can't answer two simple questions, that should be an issue for every member of this House.</p></speech>

We now know that the boat is still tied up at a wharf in Lunenburg, that it has an unusable rudder that has been sent back to the shop, and that there haven't even been sea trials yet.

I know the Auditor General will look at this someday in the future, but for now, here we are.</p>

Yesterday I asked the Minister of Internal Services to tell taxpayers who in the Liberal Government was responsible for a controversial tendering process for government phone lines that may have resulted in one of the bidders feeling the province's evaluation team was biased. The minister never answered the question about who was responsible for the process and who was on the evaluation team.</p>
<p>Now that the minister has had a chance to sleep on his non-answer, I will try again. Will the minister tell Nova Scotian taxpayers who was on the evaluation panel for this decision?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the evaluation panel is made up of people from the Public Service Commission. There were three individuals from Information Management, there was someone from the municipality - because this contract is not only for government but for the MASH sector. There was somebody from health care as well, and the universities. Thank you.</p>

HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as a result of the process and the unsuccessful bidder's complaint, the province has hired an outside consulting firm to investigate the tendering process. A draft report is due May 16<sup>th</sup>, and a final report is due June 6<sup>th</sup>. The terms for the engagement of the review stipulate that if fraudulent activity during the normal course of engagement and management is uncovered, then the government will be informed immediately.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, if fraudulent activity is uncovered, will the minister commit to ensuring taxpayers are also informed immediately and will not have to wait for the full report?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. KOUSOULIS</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the contract was actually not awarded before the process was stopped. The reason it was stopped is so that we would have a fair RFP process. We expect the full report to be back in the beginning of June, and at that point if there is any fraudulent activity, we will deal with it within the department, and taxpayers will have the availability of that full report. It will be public. Thank you.</p>

          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the consultant is charging the taxpayers $24,000 at a time when the province is already in dire financial straits. Government tenders are awarded regularly, and taxpayers should not be expected to be on the hook for the carelessness of the minister's department or lack of ministerial oversight on significant contracts such as this.</p>
<p>If the consultant determines the Liberal Government's evaluation team did, in fact, display a bias or ignore government tendering procedures, will the minister promise taxpayers today that they will not be forced to foot the bill and, instead, the Liberal Party will pick up the tab?</p></speech>

It was not a Liberal committee that chose the RFP. It was not a Liberal committee that had anything to do with the RFP. This was people in the Public Service and it was people from the MASH sector.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I will also give a little bit of insight within this process of reviewing this specific RFP and all RFPs. When there was an analysis done in the department, we saw great savings if all of our sectors of government purchased together within the department. That saving could be upwards of $50 million. This is one small step in ensuring that we are saving money on behalf of taxpayers.</p>
<p>Although the member is shocked by a $24,000 audit fee, what I am more shocked by is that we have $50 million in savings that we are not utilizing yet. This audit will reveal some things in our RFP process, which we are continually trying to improve. The last time I checked, any $25,000 investment that could yield a $50 million gain was a good investment on behalf of the taxpayers of Nova Scotia.</p></speech>

Big Brothers Big Sisters of the South Shore has 20-plus years of continuous service, matching over 200 little brothers and little sisters with screened adult volunteers. Their mentors serve as a role model and teach by example the importance of giving and giving back, staying in school, and having respect for family, peers, and the community.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question to the minister is, can the minister indicate whether or not Big Brothers Big Sisters of the South Shore will be considered for DCS funding on the same playing field as the other youth organization that she said has received funding, not based on outcomes but based on political decisions?</p></speech>

JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, all organizations that provide direct services to families, men, women, children, vulnerable Nova Scotians, are absolutely always on a direct playing field. If the former Minister of Community Services would like to go into that area, I'd like to table a comment she made in <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> in May 2013 when she talked about my program, Healing the Bruises, which was not government-funded at that time and had national outcome measurements. "When you're talking about going into an election and you're talking about the executive director running for one of the other parties, I mean, but that's not the reason we would ever deny a program, but it's a reality of the world of the political pressures, too."</p>
<p>So calling me political about any decisions I make about making sure that the best front-line services are funded is really laughable at this point.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the South Shore YMCA is a not-for-profit association of individuals dedicated to improving the quality of life for all, through the programs that promote healthy spirit, mind, and body, and also focuses on youth at risk and youth in our communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask through you to the minister, can the minister indicate whether or not the South Shore YMCA will also be considered for DCS funding on the same playing field as the political decisions that were made? It was actually admitted by the minister in Budget Estimates and in this House that it was a political decision and that she had not even read the business case.</p></speech>

<p>If you're going to stand in this House and ask me if I'm going to fund every single non-profit in the southwestern area, I think you are wasting your time. I have not looked at any area within this province with a political lens; in fact, I just released $4 million of DFC money without a political lens and most of that has gone to areas in the province - although there are not many, we do hold most of them - ridings that are of other political Parties, because I want to take politics out of that decision making and I want to make sure that where the need is they get the funding.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are so many other organizations in this province that rely on the support of the Department of Community Services, so can the minister indicate whether or not all these organizations that are going to be eligible for DCS funding will be considered on the same playing field as SHYFT was in Yarmouth?</p></speech>

Yesterday the minister said, "The contract was awarded within our procurement process. There were employees within the Public Service Commission's Information Management Department who looked over the contract, scored the contract, and at that point made an award." But then in the same breath the minister told us, "The contract had not been given to a vendor &#x2026;" And now, this morning, the minister says that the contract was not awarded.</p>
<p>So my question for the minister is - and I'll table those quotes for the benefit of the House here, but my question for the minister this morning is pretty simple - which is it, was the contract awarded to a vendor or not?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. LABI KOUSOULIS</from>
            <p>I'll clarify my comments, Mr. Speaker. The contract within the department had been graded and we had technically awarded within the department, but no contract was signed with an outside vendor, so none of the three bidders had any contract signed with them and, therefore, that had not been fully 100 per cent awarded to the vendors.</p>

          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>I guess my concern is the minister has referred to now possibly investing $24,000 in an audit to leverage $50 million in savings, so I guess the minister has some pretty serious concerns about how contracts are awarded within his department and under his responsibility if he thinks there is that much in savings to be obtained from such a small investment.</p>
<p>My question today for the minister would be, how many tenders have been awarded since he has been responsible for the process, and how much does he think may have slipped out the back door through results of failures of the process?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#e32945dc-539b-44e0-9a14-ec06f74edd6a"><from>MR. KOUSOULIS</from><p>The tenders that have been awarded and tenders that are listed are all on the procurement website - the honourable member can go and look at it any time he wishes. In terms of the savings I was talking about, there has been ongoing analysis within the department and what we have found is, as government, we're not utilizing our buying power, we are operating separately between government, between education and health care. By using our buying power collectively, we see that there's upward of $50 million of savings.</p>
<p>If you actually look at how much we purchase as a province in a $10 billion budget, we purchased about $1.2 billion, so when you're looking at upwards of $50 million in savings, we're talking three or four percentage points. Although the number is very large, all we need to do is move the bar slightly and we can have a huge savings on behalf of the taxpayers of Nova Scotia.</p></speech>

<p>My question for the minister is, will the minister tell us what action will be taken if it's determined that members of the evaluation panel, who were presumably appointed by Liberals, have been found to not have acted appropriately in the awarding of the contract?</p></speech>

These are people within the Public Service Commission, these are people within information management, within the MASH sector, people coming from the universities, from the municipality, and within government. They are government employees. They have nothing to do with this political Party or any political Party in Nova Scotia. I think the member should apologize to these civil servants, who work very hard on behalf of all Nova Scotians, for implying that they are members of a political Party or that they are looking at any sort of awarding of contracts through a political lens. That is not the case.</p>
<p>What we are looking at here is that within a procurement process we have rules. We feel that some rules were brought to our attention that might not have been followed. It's nothing to do with any political Party. We want to ensure that any contract awarded to a Nova Scotia company on behalf of the Nova Scotia taxpayer is done fairly for all parties involved. Thank you.</p></speech>

Nova Scotians are saddened to see more media reports about the mess that the Bluenose II is in. The government has been quick to blame the previous government but the fact remains that the project is now under their watch and the boat is tied to a dock without steering equipment.</p>
<p>The original contract stated the vessel would be delivered to the province on May 29, 2012, for $12,455,077 Cdn. Mr. Speaker, we are 689 days and nearly $5 million overdue. My question is, has there been a revision of the original contract to include a new delivery date and a new price tag?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Environment. Yesterday I asked the minister if he would be following through with the announced $1.5 million expansion to the Environmental Home Assessment Program. Unfortunately, the minister did not really answer that question. Under this program families who need to replace their oil tanks should receive up to $1,000 to purchase a tank, based on income. Homeowners with septic problems should receive up to $3,000 to repair or replace their aging systems. My question today for the minister is, will the minister explicitly confirm whether or not his department will follow through with the $1.5 million expansion to the Environmental Home Assessment Program announced last August?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the question. I guess I'd just like to clarify if the $1.5 million expansion that the member is referring to is included in the $1 million that was cut from that EHAP program. I can assure the member the EHAP program is still being funded, but the program she is referring to was never funded, was never implemented in the past, and so I don't know how this member can be referring to cuts to a program that never actually existed in the first place.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in 2014-15, the Department of Environment increased its budget by approximately $1.5 million, which is exactly the same cost it would have taken to provide the expansion to the Environmental Home Assessment Program.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, well we'll try to be wholesome if we can, but I would suggest that it would be very good for the minister to answer these questions on the floor of the House so that Nova Scotians watching, perhaps on Legislative TV, can hear his answers which he seems to be skirting around. My question to the minister is, can he please tell this House why he won't invest the money to help families replace their aging oil tanks and why the minister thinks this is a better use of taxpayers' money, increasing his minister's office budget by $150,000 and increasing his department's communication budget by $50,000? Does the minister think that day-to-day duties as the minister or investing that money to low-income families are more important?</p>

DELOREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, when I came into this office a few months ago, it didn't take long to realize the fundamental challenges that this department faced. Many of those challenges relate - and yesterday I was actually near the member opposite's riding out in Truro, having a community meeting, where I sat for three hours with community members having a discussion on a very important environmental issue. What became clear in that discussion, which was one of several I've had in the communities across the province discussing that issue, is that there is a lack of trust in the Department of Environment that has taken over across this province, not just in that community, many other communities on many of the files that we're dealing with.</p>
<p>The reason that I've discovered that this is an issue and a challenge is because of the complete disregard for the funding of the actual operations of the program, fulfilling our mandate which is, as a regulator, to get boots on the ground, to provide the services, to protect the health and environment of the people of Nova Scotia. That is the priority; that is how I make decisions.</p>
<p>There are several other programs and initiatives provided by the Government of Nova Scotia to provide services to low-income Nova Scotians to help with their household capital investments. We look forward to having a further discussion in about 15 minutes.</p></speech>

<p>The mining industry is concerned about the increased fees associated with prospectors and the claims renewal. The association said that Nova Scotia prospectors with 50 claims now have to pay $9,500 in fees over 10 years - up from $5,424 prior to the fee increases. I'll table that document.</p>
<p>The mining association and Nova Scotia's mining and quarry industry provide 5,500 jobs and contribute $420 million to the province's economy each year, so my question to the minister is, why isn't his government supporting this industry and making it more feasible for these claims to go forward?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca">
            <from>HON. ZACH CHURCHILL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, actually this government has proudly been supportive of the mining industry, as I've mentioned before in this House. This is one sector that we truly believe has the great potential to grow our rural economy. The fees that were brought in, which the member mentioned earlier, were actually brought in to pay for increased services to prospectors in the Province of Nova Scotia, to make their lives easier, so they don't have to drive into Halifax to pass in their application and receive their licence, they can do it online and benefit from all the online resources that service provides.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that's an interesting answer - so by not driving into the city they save money by going online and yet it costs them twice as much. Interesting.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Government hasn't provided the fuel tax rebate to the mining sector, and the Liberal Government has increased fees associated with exploratory claims - these are two negatives to the same industry, with nothing to balance it out. So will the minister commit to working with the mining industry instead of working against it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, just for clarification of the House, the costs associated with this service are very similar to our neighbours in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, and are competitive market rates. There was a small increase to prospectors here in the Province of Nova Scotia, that fee was brought in to pay for this very credible service that we are now providing.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this government is working with the mining industry, which is why we are reviewing the fuel tax rebate that they currently don't receive, which is why we're reviewing the Mineral Resources Act which hasn't been reviewed in over 30 years and I'm proud to say that it is this government that is taking that project on.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>I find that answer quite interesting. John Wightman, the executive director of the Nova Scotia Prospectors Association said that the harm being caused by the fee increase is "completely disproportional" to the small amount of revenue being generated by the government. Sean Kirby, the executive director of the Mining Association of Nova Scotia, said that prospecting and exploration are vital to finding new mines and the fees are undermining that activity.</p>
<p>Now in relation to what the minister just said about our fees being comparable to New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, the mining and prospecting associations say that the fees are on average 53 per cent higher than New Brunswick and a whopping 621 per cent higher than in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the claims are renewed every five years. So my question to the minister is, will the minister commit to working with the mining and prospecting industry instead of - wait for it - undermining them as he has been doing for the last little while?</p></speech>

There are some glitches but when asked if they would prefer to have that service at its peak and fixed or not have the fee in place, they chose to have that service in place and our government is proud to continue to support that industry so they can grow our rural economy.</p>

          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>My question today, through you, is to the Minister of Community Services. I know since the minister mentioned, I think it was through Estimates, that a review was going to be undertaken for all those groups that receive funding through her department. I know that many groups out there are concerned, are worried, about ensuring that the funding that they receive is going to be in there in coming years.</p>
<p>I know that there are many groups in my community, for example, who receive funding through her department. I know the Boys and Girls Club of Sackville has been offering prevention, intervention, and social programs for youth, for families in and around Sackville for over 20 years. They are a dedicated group of people. I know many groups like the Boys and Girls Club run with very few individuals, most of them are sometimes volunteers.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if the minister could indicate whether or not the Boys and Girls Club of Sackville will be under a review and is this one of the organizations she may have, or her department may have, concerns with about providing appropriate documentation.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#af446054-6fe0-422a-94d6-7cdff4623b7e"><from>HON. JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>Every organization that receives funding, including the one that I used to be executive director of, will be receiving letters asking them those two questions. Boys and Girls Clubs, which I have in my riding as well, transition houses, resource centres, every single organization that provides front line services to vulnerable Nova Scotians will have to answer two simple reasonable questions, which every tax paying person should expect from their government, and every person who is in receipt of these services should expect that their service provider be able to answer.</p>
<p>It is about building capacity in the non-profit sector, and from someone who has spent her professional life in the non-profit sector, it is the first time in many years that the government has actually reached out to these organizations and offered that service.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know the minister comes from that sector, and I think she would recognize and understand some of the concerns that organizations will have. As I mentioned in my initial question, many of these organizations can barely meet the needs they have now, maybe because of the number of staff. We know that the wages for many of these individuals within the non-profit organizations are quite low, and there is a lot of work involved in just providing the services.</p>
<p>I'm wondering, could the minister indicate if her department is willing to support those organizations that might find themselves in a difficult position to provide every piece of information that the department is going to request from them?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#af446054-6fe0-422a-94d6-7cdff4623b7e"><from>MS. BERNARD</from><p>I couldn't agree more with the honourable member. I know the stress of trying to run an organization from 10 per cent funding from the Government of Nova Scotia. That's why the review is in place, so that organizations that perhaps aren't providing front-line services but are funded by the department - we take a hard look at those so that we can reinvest in the Boys and Girls Clubs, in Big Brothers Big Sisters, in transition houses, in the front-line services in this province that I know are struggling. No minister knows that more than me.</p>
<p>Building capacity in organizations, especially in the community organizations that you've mentioned, they already have the ability to answer those two questions, so I'm challenging all organizations to take a look at what they do and tell me what difference it makes. It's reasonable, it provides transparency, it makes organizations accountable, it makes my department accountable to the taxpayers of Nova Scotia, and above all, it makes everyone accountable to the vulnerable Nova Scotians who receive the services.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know groups like the Memory Lane Family Place Association and Cogswell House, which has operated the HomeBridge Youth Society in Sackville since 1999 - it's a residential home for males under 18, and the Memory Lane Family Place Association offers support for families and child care services.</p>
<p>I know the minister was asked in a previous question, but the important thing to realize is that these organizations all receive funding from taxpayers. They do recognize the importance of that, and that's why Nova Scotians know exactly what organizations in this province receive funding. That's the transparency about any organization asking or requesting funding through the Department of Community Services or any department. That's why we have the process we have in place.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the minister if she would provide to Nova Scotians, to this House, the list of organizations that the department has thrown up a red flag on, because that's important for the organizations that are doing well - that we recognize the organizations that are doing well.</p>
<p>I'm wondering - I'll ask the minister, will she provide a list of those organizations that have a red flag or that the department has concerns with?</p></speech>

            <p>No front-line services organizations in Nova Scotia are looking at any funding cuts. In fact, quite a few of them have looked at a bump in their funding since this government has come in. The review is ongoing.</p>
