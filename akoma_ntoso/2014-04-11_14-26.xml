      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. Just prior to us starting the daily routine, as Speaker I do want to acknowledge the passing of former Sergeant-at-Arms Noel Knockwood, who passed away yesterday. Noel was our first Aboriginal Sergeant-at-Arms here at the House, serving the Legislature from 2000 to 2005.</p>
<p>Of course he was a well-known Mi'kmaq spiritual leader, a veteran of the Korean War, and a great, great Nova Scotian. I actually had the pleasure of meeting Noel several times as his grandchildren lived in my community of Lake Echo and he did attend our church where his grandchildren were. It was a very moving experience just in the two or three times that I did meet him and had occasion to spend a few minutes with him. I felt much calmer after spending a few minutes with Mr. Noel Knockwood.</p>
<p>So I would ask that all members of the House please rise and observe a moment of silence in honour of former Sergeant-at-Arms Noel Knockwood.</p></speech>
