MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's my great pleasure to draw attention to the east gallery this afternoon, to introduce the members of the Mental Health and Addictions Advisory Committee to all members of this Legislature. I would ask the members to stand as I introduce them. I'll begin with the co-chairmen of the advisory committee: Dr. Michael Ungar and Joyce McDonald, who chaired this committee. Michael, as people are aware, is an internationally recognized expert in the area of resilience in young people and teaches at the School of Social Work; Joyce is a psychiatric nurse, the former executive director of the Mental Health Association in the Truro area.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. A.J., who is known to many people here, a family practitioner from Halifax; Chief Frank Beazley from the Halifax Regional Municipality, who we are all going to miss very much when he retires and we wish him well; Andy Cox, a mental health advocate at the IWK who, I also believe, sits on the Mental Health Commission of Canada, if I am not mistaken; Paul d'Entremont, a founding member of R&#xE9;seau Sant&#xE9; and a member of the Acadian and francophone community, very knowledgeable of those communities; Daphne Hutt-MacLeod, the director of Eskasoni Mental Health Services; Lana MacLean, a social worker who works with youth and families and is very familiar with the African Nova Scotian community; Cecilia McRae, president of the Schizophrenic Society of Nova Scotia and caregiver of a family member with schizophrenia; Kathleen Thompson, the mother of a young woman who has been battling an eating disorder for a number of years; and Catherine Thurston, a child psychologist, formerly in the Cumberland District Health Authority and very knowledgeable in that area.</p>
<p>I hope I haven't missed anyone. I also see members of the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation here. I want to thank this fine group, and I know that everybody here will want to do this. These folks worked as volunteers, and put in many, many hours developing their report. Would members please extend a welcome and a thank-you to them. (Applause)</p></speech>
