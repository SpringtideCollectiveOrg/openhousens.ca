<p>Whereas May is Gaelic Awareness Month, which is a chance for all Nova Scotians to learn about, and more fully appreciate and experience, the language and cultural expression of the Gaels; and</p>
<p>Whereas Gaelic-speaking elders, a dedicated adult learner community, young and actively engaged adult learners, and a growing number of youth involved in school and mentorship programs are testaments to the numerous contributions Gaels make to our province and to a community that is actively working to reclaim its language and identity; and</p>
<p>Whereas a focal point of this year's Gaelic Awareness Month is the recognition of the many young people enrolled in the Gaelic Affairs' and Gaelic College's collaborative pilot program, The Young Heroes, a program that focuses on conveying Gaelic cultural expression such as storytelling, song, music, and step-dancing through the medium of the Gaelic language;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the House of Assembly recognize and thank the many volunteers and organizers in the Gaelic community who work tirelessly to share and promote Gaelic language and culture in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

They are a men's senior baseball team that, last November, won the Roy Hobbs World Series Baseball Tournament, which is held annually at Hammond Stadium in Fort Myers, Florida.</p>
<p>So 2013 marked the 25<sup>th</sup> year of the tournament and with the Monarchs' victory in the Classic Division - one that I would fit in, 60 and over - they are the first Canadian team to have won it. So it is my distinct pleasure, as a baseball fan and as the Minister of Seniors, to congratulate and welcome the Monarchs, led by Team Captain Gary Foran, to the House here today. Let's give them a warm welcome. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. According to a new report out yesterday, Nova Scotia's economy grew by only 0.8 per cent in 2013. That makes us the second worst performing province in all of Canada. In fact while the rest of the country moves ahead, our province continues to lag behind.</p>
<p>The fact is that we do have one road map for turning around our economy, Mr. Speaker, and that is the Ivany report. I'd like to ask the Premier, in light of this new information about our stagnated economy, will he now commit to enacting the 19 goals contained in the Ivany report?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#stephen.mcneil">
            <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the honourable member for the question. I had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Ivany and members of the commission today. They are pleased at the direction government is going. They are encouraged by the fact that we continue to reach out to the private sector and continue to build the plan that they laid out towards a 10-year vision and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with those members, even though the commission is no longer in existence, but all of them have a tremendous contribution to make and it's their voices over the next number of years that will continue to ensure that we move forward and grow good jobs here in Nova Scotia.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>One of the recommendations of the Ivany commission itself was that the province put its 19 goals to turn our economy around into legislation, much like we've done before with the environmental goals in the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act. Since the Ivany commission has reported, we now find out that not only has our economy flat-lined but manufacturing output is down by 2 per cent with 14 of 19 industries in outright decline, a real recession in the manufacturing economy where some of the best-paying jobs are, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask the Premier, what more evidence does he need that it's time to actually enact the 19 goals contained in the Ivany report?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure how many jobs are going to be created by creating another piece of legislation in this province.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>Mr. Speaker</from>
            <p>I could tell you what Mr. Ivany and all members of that commission said, : it is the spirit and the intent of their work that will drive this government going forward. That's what they were looking for, a government that is focused on the future 10 years out, not one that is focused on 10 days out.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Ivany commissioners themselves felt that it would be worthwhile to enact their 19 goals to turn our economy around, much as we have done before on things as important as our environmental targets. I'll tell you, there is legislation that actually kills jobs in this province, like the budget of the Liberal Party, which adds $500 billion to our debt, which leaves our taxes high, which taxes our young graduates with the highest increase in their taxes in the history of the province.</p>
<p>We certainly have seen examples of legislation that kills jobs in this session, Mr. Speaker. It would be nice to see some legislation that actually aims to create the environment to get jobs going again.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that we now have the highest taxes in the country; we have the highest power rates. These are issues that really need to be addressed, Mr. Speaker. We've now had almost seven months under the Liberal Government and coming to the conclusion of the second full session since the new government took office.</p>
<p>I'll ask the Premier, why has he squandered two full sessions of this House and seven months in office, without a real plan to create jobs?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, let me begin by suggesting to you that the Leader of the Official Opposition has run out of questions during this session - it's a good thing that we're coming to an end. He likes to stand here and lecture the members of this House when, in fact, it was Ray Ivany himself who said it is not the fact that these need to be in legislation, it's the intent of what this report says - and we want to ensure that the government focuses on the intent and commits to long-term jobs.</p>
<p>It was this government in six months that, Mr. Speaker, ended up taking off - will end up taking the NDP electricity tax off every power bill in this province; it is this government that has broadened the apprenticeship opportunities for young apprentices in this province, keeping more young people at home; and it is this government that is investing in research, giving young graduates an opportunity to find that research opportunity here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>One of the things the Ivany commission said very clearly is short-sighted goals will not do it, a government with a long-term vision will make it happen - and that's exactly why Nova Scotians elected us. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM.: DHAs - AMALGAMATION/SAVINGS</heading>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier.</p>
<p>Yesterday I tabled in this House a briefing note that indicated the Liberal Government has estimated and approved the costs of DHA amalgamation, something the Minister of Health and Wellness subsequently denied, but as the minister said to reporters yesterday afternoon: "No, I have no figure on what it would cost, no."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is not what the Health and Wellness Minister was telling media on the 8<sup>th</sup> of March this year when <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> reported that the Liberal plan to restructure DHAs would save $13 million a year - and I'll table that report.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier to this, if his Liberal Government has yet to determine how much DHA amalgamation will cost Nova Scotia, how are they able to say how much it will save?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all let me congratulate the Minister of Health and Wellness on the tremendous work he has been doing on behalf of all Nova Scotians. I must tell you there is not a day that goes by where I am not contacted by a health care provider or someone involved in the health care system who actually congratulates me for appointing the Minister of Health and Wellness - somebody is finally listening.</p>
<p>What the Minister of Health and Wellness has clearly said is that we are going to move from an administrative-focused health care system to one that is patient-focused. Let's not lose sight of the fact that this is about patients' access to health care in this province. By breaking down the walls that have been created in this province, we are going to allow Nova Scotians to have greater access to health care in every community across this province.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, yesterday following Question Period, the Minister of Health and Wellness was unable to provide a figure for what the DHA amalgamation would cost, he wasn't able to say what staff or services would be impacted, and he wasn't certain how long the process would take. He couldn't even say if the DHA CEOs and vice-presidents would be terminated - he suggested that some of them might just get new job titles and be moved around. The most the minister could promise was "that it would be an evolving and organic kind of process."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question for the Premier is this, since the Health and Wellness Minister had no idea what the real or even assumed costs of DHA amalgamation would be, why is the Premier taking Nova Scotia on what could be a costly and chaotic ride where the health care system requires immediate attention at the front line and not another Liberal reorganization?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the only people in Nova Scotia who have not come to the conclusion that there is too much administration in health care and not enough focus on the front line is the New Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The Minister of Health and Wellness is working and collaborating with health care providers and health care professionals across this province to ensure that we deliver a cost-effective health care model, one that is sustainable and one that is focused on the patient and one that will deliver health care to every community across this province.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald">
            <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I need no lecture from the Premier on reducing administration in the health care system. Health care administration decreased by 2 per cent in the previous four years and with respect to front-line health care, we have seen pharmacists being able to deliver flu shots and vaccines. We have seen significant improvements in mental health front-line care. (Interruption)</p>

            <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Thank you. The briefing note I tabled yesterday also reveals another blatant Liberal broken promise. In the Liberal platform, on Page 25, in black and white, to reduce health care administration costs by $13 million in 2015-16 but we now know that the Liberal DHA amalgamation is going to result in added administrative costs, not just in the transition year but several years after that. Once again the Liberal Government is not delivering as advertised. My question to the Premier is why did he make a promise to Nova Scotians without knowing or having a plan on how to achieve it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, now we know why Nova Scotians made the decision they did on October 8<sup>th</sup>. Only in the NDP mathematics could cutting administration actually cost more. One of the things that we know for certain is almost every wait time in this province is above the national average. One of the reasons for breaking down the walls in the health care service in this province is to ensure better access, more focus on front-line health care, and more focus on wait times. The Minister of Health and Wellness will end up delivering, not only on the commitment that we've made, but ensuring that Nova Scotians get the kind of health care services they deserve.</p>

          <heading>PREM. - IVANY REPT.: LONG-TERM GOALS - IMPLEMENT</heading>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON.JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I see the lectures are flying fast and furious across the aisle here this afternoon in the House of Assembly. A moment ago the Premier expressed his concern about short-term goals or short-sighted goals, I believe he said. I'll tell you what a short-sighted goal is: promising to charge Nova Scotia Power the efficiency fee before the election but then charging it right back to their customers after. That's pretty short sighted. Promising to balance the budget before the election and driving up our debt another $500 million in your first year - that's pretty short sighted. Promising to support young grads and then putting the largest tax increase in the history of the province on their backs - that is very short sighted.</p>
<p>No wonder business confidence in this province reached an all-time low in the month of April, as reported by the CFIB, and I will table that. I would like to ask the Premier, if he is so concerned about short-sightedness, why doesn't he get on with the job of implementing the long-term goals contained in the Ivany report as they themselves asked?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we're going to get on with the task of working with the private sector to ensure that we have long-term job growth in this province. We're going to get on with the task of ensuring we deliver on the commitments we made to Nova Scotians. All we need is for the Progressive Conservative Leader to stop being so pessimistic, all other Nova Scotians are optimistic about the future.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I should watch behind my back, is that what you're saying? (Interruptions) Well he does have the hair cut for it, Mr. Speaker, I will say that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says the biggest constraint to actually hiring people in this province is the cost of fuel and energy - 68 per cent of our small businesses said that in the report I just tabled. They aren't optimistic when all they see is a shell game of an energy plan from this government that promised them so much more before the election. They say that taxes and regulations are the second biggest impediment to getting going and creating jobs at 58 per cent, but that they watch a government that raises our taxes and drives up our debt and projects deficits well into the future.</p>
<p>I'd just like to ask the Premier, how much lower does business confidence have to go before he gets serious about the goals contained in the Ivany report?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to first of all congratulate the Minister of Energy for the tremendous work that he's been doing on behalf of all Nova Scotians. For the first time in the history of this province, shareholders of Nova Scotia Power are being forced to ensure that low-income Nova Scotians have access to grants.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Energy is also removing the NDP electricity tax on every power bill as of January 1<sup>st</sup>, which means power rates are going there but he didn't stop there. He continued to ensure that we work on energy efficiency and we drive in competition so the fuel prices will continue to decline. That means power rates will continue to go down even further.</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance and Treasury Board has continued to work with businesses across the sector to ensure that we continue to see which taxes we can lower to best drive the economy of the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The Minister of Labour and Advanced Education is working with the university sector to ensure that we take advantage of the great economic entities our universities are to ensure that young people are here. The great announcements we've made around the sandbox program, working with private sector and public intuitions, the investments we have made in research ensuring that university graduates get their first opportunity here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In six months, Mr. Speaker, that's what we've done and we're not stopping there.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>I see we're not done with the lectures here this afternoon but the fact of the matter is that actions speak louder than words and the actions of this government have sent a very strong message to the small businesses that make up the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the ones that have the lowest confidence in the whole country. His actions to add another half a billion dollars to our debt this year, to jack up government spending for years to come with so little to show for it, to project another billion dollars in debt over the life of his government, no wonder they have the second lowest confidence level in all the country. When it comes to things that they say hold us back, like taxes and regulations, all the Premier offers is more study and no action and more lectures.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I will ask as this second full session of the government winds down, how many more Nova Scotians need to leave, or how many more need to lose their jobs, before this Premier stops studying and starts taking action.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I just laid out very clearly the direction that many Cabinet Ministers - and I could go through the entire Cabinet if you'd like to know the positive things that have happened in the last six months.

          <heading>LAE: EMPLOYMENT DECLINE - ACTION</heading>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>My question is to the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. Over the last five years, according to numbers from Statistics Canada, the number of youth and their employment has been in decline in this province, and I'll table that document. The number of people aged 15 to 65 has declined by 16,500. The number of people aged 65-plus has increased by a whopping 37,600. To make a bad situation worse, the unemployment rate for our youngest workers is sky high: females 15 to 24 have an unemployment rate of 17.7 per cent, and males of the same age have an unemployment rate of 22.1 per cent.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister commit to taking these issues seriously going forward and taking real action to address the looming challenges?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#kelly.regan">
            <from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from>
            <p>I do believe we have been very clear about our concern about our young people, Mr. Speaker, and that is why we have, for example, brought in our graduate scholarships program. The Department of Labour and Advanced Education is very serious about the employment of our young people, for example and that is why we have brought in a new special operating agency for apprenticeships here in this province. When we took office, our apprentices were taking a full two years longer to complete their apprenticeship programs than anywhere else in the country. We're changing that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell">
            <from>MR. ORRELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I believe the reason it has taken a full two years longer for our apprentices is there are no jobs for them to gain their hours with. The Ivany report points to bold change, a drastic change that is needed to turn a major problem around. The House of Assembly has now been sitting for over a month, yet there is no movement towards enshrining the Ivany goals into law. Setting these goals in law would unite the province behind them and send a strong message that these goals are being taken seriously. My question is, why is the minister hesitant at getting goals and targets in law?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#kelly.regan">
            <from>MS. REGAN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I remain astonished by the Progressive Conservative caucus who appear to believe that if you enshrine something in legislation, it will magically happen. That's not how it works. We have been very clear that we are creating the conditions that will make it possible for business to step up and create the jobs in Nova Scotia, especially for our young people.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the youth in our province need to know that Nova Scotia has a place for them in the future. They have been dealt the biggest tax increase they will likely ever see by this government with the elimination of Graduate Retention Rebate. In the last five years the level of employment for males age 25 to 54 has declined by 10,400; full-time employment has declined by 23.9 per cent for females and 10.9 per cent for males 15 to 24. These statistics point to drastic changes needed, but ignored by the government in this House sitting.</p>

          <heading>PREM. - GRAD. RETENTION REBATE: CUT - TIMING EXPLAIN</heading>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. On Monday evening, graduates in our Red Room said the Graduate Retention Rebate helped them pay off debt, invest in the economy, and pay their bills. When explaining why the cut of the Graduate Retention Rebate was not followed with an equal investment in programs for young people, the Premier explained that his government needed more time to develop all these new untested initiatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if the Premier needed more time for new programs, why did he immediately cut the Graduate Retention Rebate when he could easily have phased it out over a couple of years to ease the burden of the cut on the people it was helping?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the issue around the Graduate Retention Rebate program is that it was not doing what it intended to do, which was retain more students. There is absolutely no question there were some students in this province - they actually weren't students - some young Nova Scotians had regained employment and were receiving a tax benefit for having that job in this province.</p>
<p>The reason for the Graduate Retention Rebate program was actually to provide opportunities for more students to access the workforce. What we've done is take the money that was involved in the Graduate Retention Rebate program, and targeted it towards job opportunities and job creation. We understand from students the cost of post-secondary education is creating great pressures on them. We're going to continue the conversation with students to see how we can ensure that post-secondary education is affordable for all Nova Scotians.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, student leaders said they were meeting with the government the very day before the Graduate Retention Rebate program was cut and they were hopeful that there would be programs based on what they were speaking to the government about.</p>
<p>In <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> today students said the loss of the Graduate Retention Rebate redirects about $35 million away from young people - and I'll table that article, Mr. Speaker. Why did the government not tell students and graduates that they intended to cut the Graduate Retention Rebate and not reinvest in the programs they were hopeful that they were going to see based on their advocacy with government members?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the honourable member and all members of this House that there wasn't a single student who received any of that $50 million that she's talking about. It was a tax benefit to people who had received a job and earned a job in this province. The initiative was to actually try to drive more job opportunities. We recognize that there's a difference between what the Graduate Retention Rebate program was and the investments that we have made. We've invested in reducing the interest on student loans; we've created a program, Graduate to Opportunities, in the first year - that program is in its infancy. It is our hope that because of the success of that and the combination of working with business owners to provide more opportunities that program will grow.</p>
<p>Just like the Graduate Retention Rebate program grew over time, this program - we're doing what a responsible government should do and that's budget and make sure that we're getting the most effective use of taxpayers' dollars.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, on the backbenches of the Liberal Government, there's a former president of the Acadia Student Union; also, the MLA for Yarmouth is a former student leader. I wonder, would the Premier tell us what he said to convince these members that it was okay to vote in favour of cutting programs for students without redirecting these funds? (Interruptions)</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Thank you. I'll begin again.</p>
<p>Can the Premier tell us what he said to convince former student leaders of his government that it was okay to cut a program like the Graduate Retention Rebate without redirecting these funds to help students?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it was today's student leaders who told us the program didn't work. It was today's student leaders who said the program wasn't doing what it should, to get rid of that program.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, we're not questioning whether or not at all that those Nova Scotians who were benefiting from this program actually saw a benefit from it. But the issue of the program was trying to create new job opportunities for university graduates. That's what we've redirected some of that funding into, to ensure we could provide more job opportunities. Student leaders are telling us, just like the members she mentioned have told us, we need to work on post-secondary education affordability. We had hoped, quite frankly, in the last four years there might have been some movement on that. What we're going to do is continue to work with university student union presidents and we're going to work with Nova Scotians to ensure the affordability of post-secondary education for every single Nova Scotian.</p>
<p>I want to remind the honourable member: post-secondary education is unaffordable for some Nova Scotians and we're going to make sure that every Nova Scotian has access to post-secondary education.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#karla.macfarlane"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the process used to decide school closures is broken and flawed; Mr. Fowler's report made that perfectly clear. He said school reviews were having a negative impact on the relationship between school boards, parents, and communities. Schools in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board are being forced to live by decisions made under our broken system - and I know that from the other side of the floor here we've been talking about being negative and pessimistic, but I am positive and optimistic that the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development will hopefully demand that the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board will suspend decisions made under the broken process.</p></speech>

            <from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my thanks to the member opposite for the question. The member has made a statement that is very true in that the school review process can have a negative impact, and the intent of the new legislation is to try to reduce the negativity and perhaps build some collaboration and some trust. I could go on to tell the member - and I've stated this publicly - that I have asked the Chignecto board to look at the decisions that they made that were conditional and that they would give those schools impacted an additional year. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that. That's very positive and hopeful, especially for the River John Consolidated School, because it is the lifeline of the community. Residents are working very hard to develop a hub school model to ensure the building is completely utilized and the community is well served. I'm hoping that the minister will throw the community of River John a lifeline and act to make sure the school is not closed before every option is examined, and I'm hoping that she can confirm that.</p>

            <from>MS. CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the informal request that went to the Chignecto board was to have the time frame extended by one year on those conditional closure motions. The formal request has gone to the board chair and the board chair has informed me that that will be on the agenda when the board meets - I believe it's May 6<sup>th</sup>. I would encourage the member opposite to work with her school board member to ensure that her concerns are heard and that her school board member takes them to that public board meeting.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her answer. I'm a little bit perplexed because there are a lot of parties involved in this situation that's happening. I'm just wondering if she could table that formal request that was made to the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board, and if it was perhaps informal, if she's willing to maybe provide a letter now just so the parents, teachers, and children - even those who have been attending all of these meetings that I have been going to - that they actually have a paper trail. I know they want to believe that the minister did request that to the school board, and it would just give them much comfort.</p>

          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is to the Minister of Agriculture. An important and respected organization, the Women's Institutes of Nova Scotia, has been enriching our province for more than 100 years. This vibrant organization currently has over 700 members who contribute in excess of 100,000 volunteer hours every year. The organization recently had to inform its members that its annual operating grant of just $27,000 for the current fiscal year is being discontinued by the minister's department.</p>
<p>My question is, why has the minister chosen to no longer fund this organization's operating grant?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. It's a very important question. I did meet with the Women's Institutes last year. Actually, your government had decided not to fund the Women's Institutes for the $27,000. I did have the $27,000 put in place last year at the end of the year after I met with them and proceeded with that, and I've made arrangements for a little bit different structure this year, but if you'd like to ask me another question I could describe that in more detail.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann">
            <from>MS. ZANN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the volunteer hours that these women contribute to our communities represent more than $1 million in unpaid work that are donated to the province, and their service at our homeless shelters, food banks, women's centres, and countless other community organizations is really invaluable. My question is, is the minister saying that he is going to fund $27,000 of operating grants, you're going to continue that to the Women's Institutes of Nova Scotia?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>MR. COLWELL</from>
            <p>Yes, we will, but it's going to be a little different structure this year. What I proposed to the Women's Institutes last year when I met with them was we were very interested in continuing supporting them. They do very important work in the community, a wonderful group of ladies who are very dedicated to agriculture in the province. What I suggested they may do is help us promote some of our industries - the wine industry, the agriculture industry - do some displays and offer them some promotional material to do that and work with the industry to do that. I think that would give them an opportunity to get their profile higher in the community, and also serve as a very important function for us in promoting locally-grown and produced products.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann">
            <from>MS. ZANN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, is the minister suggesting a workfare type of situation for this incredibly important organization that put so many volunteer hours into so many of our different organizations right across the province for over 100 years? I've heard through the grapevine and through speaking with them that this is indeed what you are suggesting, that in order to get any money now that they need to do some work for your department for that funding.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell"><from>MR. COLWELL</from><p>No, that is not correct. We are going to fund the Women's Institutes for $27,000. We also want to work with them to help promote Nova Scotia products in the Superstores, grocery stores or whatever - the ones that they want to do. It would be totally voluntary on their part. We will provide the materials to do that, and it's going to be a working relationship between our department and the Women's Institutes, which I think is very important - a very well-respected organization, and what better group to do this and work closely with us in that regard.</p>
<p>Again, it is totally voluntary, and we look forward to working with them. They were very receptive to that approach when I met with them this earlier this year.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. More than 80,000 public sector workers are asking questions about the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board's most recent Budget Address, where she suggested wage increases were unsustainable. She said, "We need a new approach, and we must be innovative and creative in tackling these issues."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the last time the Liberals were in government they rolled back wages and they laid off hundreds of nurses, teachers, and other government workers. My question to the minister is, will the minister respect public sector workers and explain to those hard-working Nova Scotians in our public sector what she means by her new approach?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#diana.whalen">
            <from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. Essentially there's an easy answer to this question, and it is that all of us need to work together to find a way for Nova Scotia to be on a firm fiscal footing. We've already demonstrated that we respect the collective bargaining process, and we hope to work very well with all of the unions that we are involved with. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know that we all have the greatest respect for people in the public sector and in our workforce, but this is a very serious matter for public sector workers who can read the words of the minister and who do get concerned when they see language like, we have to rise above narrow interest.</p>
<p>In the same budget address, the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board said that a wage increase of 2 per cent is, "&#x2026; simply not sustainable", which is a far cry from what her Leader said when they were in Opposition where he said, "The efforts of many Nova Scotians have not been rewarded because wages were essentially flat &#x2026;"</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, since 2 per cent is not sustainable, can the minister tell the 80,000 public sector workers affected what she considers to be a sustainable wage increase?</p></speech>

            <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the honourable member. As all of us know in the House, we have to respect the collective bargaining process and that will ultimately determine where each of the agreements go in the future. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I don't know that all of us know we need to respect the collective bargaining process, given that we've had Bill No. 37 imposed on the workers of this province. But in a Canadian Press article from March 14<sup>th</sup>, it says, "&#x2026; civil service job cuts are not a priority in this year's budget." So it's not in this year's budget, but we don't know where the government will proceed in subsequent years.</p>
<p>Public sector workers know what the Liberal Party did in the 1990s, and they are worried that this history could repeat itself. So my final question to the minister is, will those workers in our public sector expect to see wage freezes, wage rollbacks or layoffs under the Liberal Government?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I think it's really important to remind members of the House that when we came to office just six months ago, the Premier made a concerted effort to visit every single department in the downtown core and in the far-flung corners of this province to speak to civil servants and to engage them in the work we have ahead of us. We know that all of the challenges that we face are going to require the creativity and innovation and frankly the experience of our civil servants in the public service, and we hope to work with them at every step of the way. I know all other members are following the Premier's example.</p>

<p>School libraries play a significant role in the developing of literacy and research skills that will benefit students when they move on to their professions or pursue a post-secondary education.

          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to ask a question to the Minister of Energy. I know we haven't asked too many questions of him this sitting so I thought, as we're getting close to an end, we would ask him a question and listen to what kind of interesting things he'll have to say.</p>
<p>Larry Hughes of Dalhousie University is skeptical that the changes to Efficiency Nova Scotia will result in savings to consumers. In Allnovascotia.com today, he suggests that changing the way electricity is billed by offering off-peak incentives would be best, and I'll table that of course. My question is, can we expect the government to review electricity billing in order to bring down electricity costs for Nova Scotians?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all just to clarify what Mr. Hughes actually said, he said he was skeptical over the energy saving amounts that Efficiency Nova Scotia said they had achieved last year. In that article he actually didn't say anything one way or the other about the particular changes we made. In fact, I've spoken to him about it myself.</p>
<p>To the member's question, it's actually a very good question. What he is talking about is time-of-day pricing. The member may be aware that time-of-day pricing is actually specifically included in the RFPs and the reviews that just went out and are part of the electricity review underway at the moment.</p>
<p>I will say, however, in some places where we have switched to time-of-day rates, the amount paid by consumers has actually increased, not decreased, because of course the times that most people use energy are during the peak-price times, which are higher than they would be now. It is under review but we shouldn't assume that it's necessarily a cheaper option.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>The quote is - well it's not really a quote because it's just written, of course, in this article: "Larry Hughes, professor in electrical engineering at Dalhousie University, is skeptical of the benefits touted by Efficiency Nova Scotia. He says if the goal is to save all Nova Scotia electricity customers money, the province needs to change the way electricity is billed."</p>
<p>We recognize that the government is currently conducting an electricity review but as this review is conducted, Nova Scotians will continue to pay the highest electricity rates in the country. This new electricity plan is not expected to be introduced until somewhere near 2015 or early 2016.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, does the government plan to enact any relief for ratepayers in the meantime, over the next couple of years?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger">
            <from>MR. YOUNGER</from>
            <p>Well as a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, last night the Legislature voted in favour of removing a tax from electricity bills, which would be the first time in recent memory that bills will have actually gone down. It's unfortunate that the other members voted against that and, in fact, voted in favour of bills going up for Nova Scotians.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Well what we voted against was smoke and mirrors, that's what we voted against. We voted against a shell game, when you promise one thing and produce another.</p>
<p>So trying to stick to the question at hand, though, smart group technologies enable ratepayers to better understand their energy consumption and save money. They can also better promote time-of-day billing and put less of a strain on the electricity system.</p>
<p>My question is, can the minister provide details on his discussions regarding smart grid technologies with Nova Scotia Power and the potential benefits that an upgraded grid could have for ratepayers?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that answer would probably take the rest of the Question Period. What I will say is that I find it interesting that the member is suggesting moving to a smart grid technology when, in fact, the people who would have to pay for that are ratepayers and in every jurisdiction that that has moved to, ratepayers have actually had a charge on their bills, which has increased their rates to pay for the new meters and the new grid infrastructure and so forth.</p>
<p>The reality is, as I said earlier, it is under review; it is being studied to see where there are benefits but let's not assume that it automatically will result in net savings to ratepayers because the experience in most jurisdictions, quite frankly because of the time of day that most people work and most people use electricity, there aren't that many people getting up at 2:00 a.m. to do their laundry to take advantage of the cheaper overnight rates, means that in most cases bills actually go up.</p></speech>

          <heading>EECD - FOWLER REPT.: CHIGNECTO-CENTRAL REG. SCH. BD. PREM.: STRIKING NURSES - DISCIPLINARY ACTION</heading>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Premier. All members of the House heard from many nurses as they came to the Legislature through Law Amendments Committee to speak up against Bill No. 37, and it took a lot of courage for many of them. They came here and they tried to explain to government members what the conditions were they were working in and really advocating for their patients. Many of them now are facing discipline - disciplinary hearings are scheduled to begin next week for over 170 of these nurses.</p>
<p>So I would like to ask through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Premier is, why does the Premier think it`s appropriate for these nurses to be disciplined when they were only standing up for their rights but, more importantly, the rights of their patients?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know the honourable member would know that this is something between the nurses and their employer.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I could take that as an answer, but the Premier has made comments about this. The Premier and his government have hit nurses time and time again since taking office. First they took away their rights to a fair collective bargaining process through Bill No. 37, and then they cut the Graduate Retention Tax Rebate for young nursing grads, which many of them have contacted us and said they benefited from that program.</p>
<p>Now, I know his comments from earlier really supported, I think, Capital Health's position around punishing nurses and having disciplinary action put against them. I would like to ask the Premier, what is the Premier's plan to re-establish good relations with the nurses of Capital Health and really around the province?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the question, and I want to remind the honourable member that it was this government that protected the right to strike for health care workers. It was the former New Democratic Party that stripped that right away from paramedics across this province - we remember that, it wasn't all that long ago. We also remember that every union leader supported the NDP's decision to strip the right to strike away from paramedics.</p>
<p>We believe we did right, which was bringing in essential services legislation which would protect essential services and at the same time allowing health care providers to exercise their right to strike.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know the over 170 nurses who took job action to try to protest against Bill No. 37 were doing the right thing. They were trying to advocate not only for themselves, but more importantly for the patients that they serve. One presenter after another told about conditions that they work under and that things needed to change. Morale is low at Capital Health and with Bill No. 37, I think you'll see that morale go even lower across the province.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the Premier, why won't the Premier accept that the treatment of nurses has been unfair and begin to give nurses the respect they so richly deserve, and support them in calling off Capital Health on the disciplinary action that's going to take place next week?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think the Minister of Health and Wellness has made it very clear that nurses make tremendous contributions in the health care system and without them, quite frankly, it couldn't function - and we know that.</p>
<p>The Minister of Health and Wellness has also listened to nurses when they were here, he has already engaged Capital Health to look at the staffing issues that were brought up not only in Capital Health but, indeed, across the province. There are some challenges. Those are not things that belong in the collective agreement, they are going to be solved by the Minister of Health and Wellness, who has finally paid attention to the issues that nurses have been talking about now for a couple of years.</p>
<p>And I know the honourable member is not suggesting that illegal job action should be tolerated by anyone in this province, is he?</p></speech>

Prior to and during the election, the Liberals promised to invest in education to the tune of $65 million. The Liberals promised this investment would happen immediately and I have <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> article which clearly states - and I will table that - that as of February 19<sup>th</sup> of this year, the minister is claiming that was "never the case."</p>
<p>So my question, through you Mr. Speaker to the minister is, why did she tell Nova Scotians the investment would be made immediately if that was never her intention?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#karen.casey">
            <from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to have that question raised in the House today because I'm very proud of the budget that we've been able to build that will, over the course of our mandate, reinvest $65 million back into the public system.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I guess there are different definitions of "immediately". About a year ago, on January 30, 2013, <i>The Chronicle Herald</i> published another article about the Liberal commitment to Education. It says, "&#x2026; the entire amount would be restored in the first full year of a mandate, which is typically four years." So the difference between definitions, I guess, of "immediate". My question is, how long will Nova Scotians have to wait before the investment of $65 million is made?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#karen.casey">
            <from>MS. CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I will repeat that the commitment that I have made as minister in the budget-building process that I began this year is reinvesting $65 million in the public schools of this province over the course of our mandate.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse">
            <from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from>
            <p>Once again, Mr. Speaker, in this House and during Budget Estimates, I asked the minister to provide budget details outlining where $65 million was actually removed from the budget in previous years. The minister hasn't produced that evidence yet because I know - we all know - that evidence does not exist. My question is, why should Nova Scotians have any faith the minister will keep her promise to invest the $65 million at all when she has a track record of not being forthright with them?</p>

            <from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture is taking an initiative to promote local grass-fed beef in our province. Nova Scotia is an ideal place to encourage this as forage land represents 65 per cent of the total crop land province-wide. My question is, can the minister confirm that the grass-fed beef industry is still a priority for this new government?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
            <p>We are presently reviewing that policy and as it appears at the present time, we are going to possibly be funding some more activities in that area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr">
            <from>MR. LOHR</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for that response. Many rural areas in our province are facing issues with the lack of provincially inspected meat processing facilities. Farmers are being forced to travel as far as P.E.I. because many facilities do not have space. While in Opposition, the now-Minister of Health and Wellness told reporters, "Smaller processing plants serving local markets may be the answer for the beef industry." He further pointed out that "The province is promoting local grass-fed beef, but many areas don't have the kill-floor capacity. A local beef plant is a necessary component of developing that part of the industry." I will table those comments from the now-Minister of Health and Wellness. Does the minister agree with his Cabinet colleague?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell"><from>MR. COLWELL</from><p>I thank the honourable member for that question. A very important part of the agriculture industry is processing. The unfortunate thing of it is, it has to be a Canadian Food Inspection Agency that inspects it. We have provincially inspected facilities that work very well but unfortunately, if we're going to ship outside of Nova Scotia, we need Canadian food inspection certified facilities. It's very expensive. We have to have a certain mass of product to put through the facility so that it runs on a continuous basis and unfortunately we don't have that volume at the present time in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when we do have that volume and we do have the provincially and federally inspected facility here so we can sell our product outside of Nova Scotia - that's in the beef industry. We do have a facility that's very nearly ready to move forward in the sheep industry, so we're working very hard on that one.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. LOHR</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the minister's response and I would like to say that yes I recognize that volume is an issue in this question and so are federal and provincial inspections.</p>
<p>In that same article the now-Minister of Health and Wellness went on to say that the Liberal plan favours a beef industry initiative comparable to the orchard renewal program because the industry is going to need some investment. My question to the minister is, what plan can the minister deliver to the beef industry in Nova Scotia and when can we expect the details?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>MR. COLWELL</from>
            <p>Again, I'd like to thank the member for that very important question. It's a very important part of our industry. We are presently working with the beef industry to see what we can do, as we are in all sectors of agriculture, to see if we can increase the productivity, also the profitability of the organizations because if they are not profitable, this won't work. We're working towards that and there are some initiatives that we will be taking in the future, which I can't discuss today because we're not ready to announce them.</p>

            <from>MR. CHUCK PORTER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. A drug that helps juvenile arthritis in remission is no longer available. Aristospan is an injection that helps juvenile arthritis patients with their pain and their inflammation. Valeo Pharma, the company which distributes this drug in Nova Scotia and elsewhere, says the decision to take the drug off the market came from a third party manufacturer. My question for the minister, can the minister inform the House today whether he or officials in his department have been in contact with the third party manufacturer to find out why they have taken the drug off the market?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>I'm aware of this important drug that has served some patients in Nova Scotians very well. I have not determined as to why it has been taken off the market. I do know that there are a number of other medications that have now been developed and have come forward, and hopefully those will accomplish the same benefits to our patients suffering from arthritis.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#chuck.porter">
            <from>MR. PORTER</from>
            <p>Doctor Suzanne Ramsey, Pediatric Rheumatologist at the IWK, refers to Aristospan as the gold standard medication saying that there isn't a substitute medication better than this one. Unfortunately 1,000 children in this province suffer from juvenile arthritis. Can the minister tell children suffering from juvenile arthritis in Nova Scotia what the department's plan might be for their treatment?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>The first plan is to look at how we can go about obtaining, through Health Canada, another manufacturer from which this Aristospan can be procured. That process is being investigated and we hope that we can get a satisfactory result.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#chuck.porter"><from>MR. PORTER</from><p>Dr. Peter Dent, a professor emeritus of pediatrics at McMaster University and the head of the division of pediatric rheumatology and immunology at McMaster Children's Hospital said he believes a profit motive may have been at the root of this problem. The Executive Director of the Canadian Arthritis Society for the Maritimes, Susan Tilley-Russell, says that the drug is a life changer for those children who need it.</p>
<p>My final supplementary, Mr. Speaker, to the minister, when will the minister be able to confirm whether he has any details about the current supply of this drug and how much longer will Nova Scotia children be without it and maybe elaborate on the plan that he just spoke of by way of what might come next?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite now is realizing, and more and more Canadians, is that some of the medications and the pharmaceuticals that we relied on to be manufactured here in Canada, we're finding now that they are letting go of that because just as he suggested, profit margins, amounts of sales, are, in fact, for just limited quantities.</p>
<p>So this is really part of that bigger picture of looking at future procurement, not just here in Nova Scotia but right across the country. We're hoping that the Pan-Canadian drug alliance and through Health Canada that we can find other companies that will provide this. This is an area that the Department of Health and Wellness has already started to look into.</p>
<p>I know the work of Dr. Ramsey at the IWK and as a rheumatologist. She is a strong advocate of this medication. We'll do all we can to keep it in the hands of Nova Scotians.</p></speech>

In last week's edition of the <i>Shelburne Coast Guard</i>, residents expressed concern over the condition of the Ferry West Road and Locke's Island Road.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure exactly the specific details of the roads that the honourable member is referring to. I could certainly have the staff, who are very committed and do a great job down in that region of the province, to have a look and provide me some update and some details on the assessment for that road, but I obviously don't have those specifics in front of me at this time.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#sterling.belliveau"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>Mr. Speaker, while tough winter weather will always add to the list of local roads in need of repair, a multi-year local roads plan would provide more transparency in the Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal budget.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when will the minister review the research the department prepared for the last government that showed a multi-year roads plan will, indeed, be possible?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. With respect to the local roads plan, I honestly don't see any merit in establishing a long-term five-year plan for local roads because the dynamics of the roads, and there's many of them across the province - over 20,000 kilometres of roads that we service as a provincial government; 9,000 kilometres of those are unpaved.</p>
<p>I think that doing the local roads year over year provides us with that flexibility. As an example for his first question, if there are immediate repairs required for that road and it wasn't in the plan, then we wouldn't have the ability to respond and make those changes. For us, it provides us with that leniency and that flexibility to react to the most pressing issues in all regions of the province and establish our priorities, based on road safety and based on what is needed at that specific time.</p>
<p>I think the fact that we do local roads year over year is a testament to the fact that we need flexibility. We'll make changes as they come up, in the immediate term, to make sure that Nova Scotians are safe. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#sterling.belliveau"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this minister has admitted that the previous government's five-year road plan has taken the politics out of paving. He has explained that he does not think he would or should have a multi-year road plan because of weather, saying - and I will table this from Hansard - "Things deteriorate quickly, and that becomes our priority."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind this minister that the very first hours of this government, he sold a paving plant, he's looking at reviewing options of turning paved roads. (Applause) Mr. Speaker, I'm going to ask the members opposite to save the applause, because I'm not through my question yet. I really appreciate the interest.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all with the question, again the local roads plan is done on an annual basis based on the need for Nova Scotians and the need of the regions within this great province - and the member is right, we don't apply politics to these decisions. I'm not sure if he's referring to a specific road, but I can tell you that I have complete faith, and our government has complete faith, in the system that has been established by the experts within TIR who make these decisions and we take their lead with respect to the local roads that are being done.</p>
<p>I also want to address the fact that, Mr. Speaker, we've had many decisions, some are tough and some vary along that spectrum in terms of difficult decisions, but I can tell you the paving plant was a very easy one for this government, both on a philosophical level and of course on a numerical level - we made the right decision for Nova Scotians and we stick with that. We're doing the best we can; obviously, the member should understand as a former Cabinet Minister that we're doing the right things with the limited budget that we have and we're making good decisions on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I'm certainly no speed bump. I'm learning as I go and I'm making good decisions and am very proud of our government and the steps we've taken to make Nova Scotians safe in this province. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Ten years ago announcements were made about the planned opening of the Donkin Mine. Recently Xstrata said that they are not going to move forward and are looking for a buyer - I wonder, could the minister tell us if there has been any success in identifying some potential buyers and where that whole process stands are this time?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#zach.churchill">
            <from>HON. ZACH CHURCHILL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the Donkin Mine I will say that this government knows the importance of that mine for the economy of Cape Breton, and we will do all in our power to support the operations of that mine. Of course, the mine becoming operational is dependent on market forces, primarily the international price point of coal. However, what we're hearing from experts in the industry is that market is starting to turn around and I believe fully, and have hope, that will lead to a situation where a commercial agreement between Glencore and another company will be highly possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for that answer because he's right, it would be important to Cape Breton. Actually the mine development will be important to all Nova Scotians because we would get a good quality coal, produced locally, bought in Canadian dollars, and that would help stabilize power prices for people right across the province, not just Cape Breton.</p>
<p>With that in mind I wonder, could the minister tell us just how recently he and the Minister of Energy have had discussions about where the Donkin Mine project is? I know there may be some things he can't release in the House, but there are many people in our area and around the province who are really wondering where this project is going. They are interested in being able to work at home instead of away. It could create 300 direct jobs and I would just hope that the minister could tell us if he and the Minister of Energy have had any discussions recently.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, our government has been in continuous conversations with the folks from Glencore and internally, within the government, on the situation there. I will say that there are few proponents of that mine greater than the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. He has been a vocal advocate of Cape Breton since I've known him, and has done a great job ensuring that our government understands the importance of Donkin and that our government is doing the very best we can to ensure that, once the market allows for a commercial agreement to take place, we facilitate that process for happening.</p>

          <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the minister for that answer and I agree that the Minister of TIR is a strong advocate and I would hope that in your Cabinet discussions that you will sit down and really work on him about fixing the road going into Donkin so that when the time comes for the mine to start, we'll actually have a good road to drive on and we'll be able to get the materials in there.</p>
<p>The last part of what I am going to say to you is that this development is important for the economy of the Province of Nova Scotia. We've heard many of you on that side talk about wanting to move the economy forward; we all do in our own different ways. I would encourage you and your Cabinet colleagues to do whatever you can to move this project forward because there are many people who are looking for it and depending on it. I hope I can get the commitment of the Minister of Natural Resources that he will do everything in his power to make this project move forward.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#zach.churchill"><from>MR. CHURCHILL</from><p>Thank you and I appreciate the importance of Donkin to the folks of Cape Breton and the impact it can have on the economy and perhaps energy prices in the province as well.</p>
<p>I do offer my commitment and the commitment of this government to do all in our power to support the Donkin project. I will say, however, this is a private enterprise and it's going to be primarily dependent on market factors. But when the time comes, I believe those factors will help us lead to a commercial agreement and the operation being reopened at the Donkin Mine.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#john.a.lohr"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. The Ivany report indicated that our traditional industries, including agriculture, need to be key economic drivers of our economy in Nova Scotia. The Department of Agriculture has programs related to land development, which are key to expanding agriculture production and have been some of the most popular programs the Department of Agriculture has had.</p>
<p>The land development programs are jointly cost shared between the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture and Agriculture Canada. Will the minister inform this House of the details of these cost-sharing agreements with Ottawa and will he supply a detailed list of the work scheduled to be done in the coming year?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the honourable member is absolutely right. It's very important that we grow the economy and agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture in the Province of Nova Scotia. The rural jobs are very important jobs and the information that was requested - as soon as I can release it, I will release the information to the Legislature.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr">
            <from>MR. LOHR</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, thank you to the minister for that answer. When new farmland is being developed, there is nothing more important than tile drainage ditching and land clearing. These are essential programs. Nova Scotians understand there has been a general loss in productive farmland to other forms of land development. My question to the minister is, will the minister confirm his department's commitment to expanding the actual land base of agriculture in the province?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>MR. COLWELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, that's another very important question for all Nova Scotians and indeed the whole country. The preservation of agricultural land in this province is critical. We have seen a lot of the land being built into subdivisions, which is not acceptable, and we are now working on a strategy to ensure that doesn't continue and ensure we can bring back into production some of the lands that have been taken out of production because of other issues and other opportunities that people have pursued.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#john.a.lohr">
            <from>MR. LOHR</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for the answer to that question. We live in a province which obliges us as farmers to invest in both irrigation and drainage. The drainage programs and ditching programs have been some of the most popular programs the department has had and demand for these programs far outstrips the funding available. Is the minister attempting or working to sign new agreements with Ottawa to increase funding for these programs?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell"><from>MR. COLWELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yes, we are. We are in the process now of finishing off some programs that are in place. We intend to pursue more programs that will help the industry. As I said earlier, it's critically important with the looming shortage of food supply in the next 20 to 40 years that we preserve our land, our agricultural land. Even if we get all our land back in production, which won't be practical because of some of the things that have happened to it in the meantime, we're still not going to be able to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Just to add to that, we only produce 20 per cent of the food we consume in Nova Scotia. Most Nova Scotians don't realize that. We're going to do everything we can to get that number up and also to increase our exports and help our economy.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you today is also for the Minister of Agriculture, a very popular gentleman today. Community-supported agriculture is a way for all of us - even if we live in urban areas - to support small-scale, local producers and enjoy farm-fresh food. Better known as CSA, this process engages community members as shareholders in farms and there are now over 30 farms operating under this model in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Through you, Mr. Speaker, could the minister please advise us of how many meetings he has had so far with the CSA community since taking over as Minister of Agriculture?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, this is a very important part of agriculture in our province and we will continue to work with those organizations to ensure that they grow and prosper as time moves forward.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I take it from that answer that perhaps the minister has not had a chance to meet with those organizations yet. I hope that he does so in the future.</p>
<p>In 2013, Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party told Nova Scotians that if elected, they would "&#x2026; make certain local products are present in our academic and health care facilities." I will table that. But they have yet to tell us how they are going to do that.</p>
<p>My final question through you to the minister, will the minister please tell this House when he will follow through on this election promise and how much it will cost? Sorry, that's my second question.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">
            <from>MR. COLWELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, again it's a very important question. We are presently working with many institutions in the province to ensure we have the maximum amount of locally-grown products in their facilities and we're getting a very good response. I know the Department of Health and Wellness has set a standard in their facilities for doing this and we're going to follow the model they have. We're working very closely with some other organizations in that regard, including the Ecology Action Centre.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, and yes, this is my final supplementary. Thank you for that response, through you to the minister. In 2013, the Department of Agriculture announced that $220,000 would actually be available this fiscal year for provincial CSAs. This money was going towards helping Nova Scotia's existing operations to better market themselves, as well as undertaking new research into sustainable farming practices.</p>
<p>My final question, Mr. Speaker, through you, is, can the minister please explain how and when this $220,000 will be distributed?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#keith.colwell">

            <p>Mr. Speaker, to my colleague, the member for Fairview-Clayton Park, one of the most important questions that has been asked in the House this session. I know it's one that the Premier and I and many others and former Ministers of Health have been very, very frustrated by when we have so many very capable medical graduates who train outside of Nova Scotia and who can't get back here for residency and to practise. It is one of the areas that I have asked the committee dealing with the recruitment and retention of doctors to take a look at. It's one that I will join B.C. at the national ministers' conference in the Fall, to change the way that the current practice operates.</p>

          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. First of all, I just want to say that with the traffic that will be coming down Highway No. 103 and Highway No. 101, once the new ferry starts coming through, I want to underline that there are a number of deficiencies along a couple of those highways that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>The first one that I will underline is the completion of those two highways. Of course, with Highway No. 103 there is some work going on through Port Mouton, and of course, there's the issue of everything down Highway No. 101, as you go down through Weymouth. I'm just wondering, where in the department's world is the completion of Highway No. 101 and Highway No. 103 on its radar?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all, with both projects the reality is - and I know the member is very aware of this, and all members of the House are - these are massive investments on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia, and we truly do require the partnership with the federal government, which has been outstanding to this point in my tenure, and long before me.</p>
<p>The Building Canada Fund is currently in negotiations, and we're working with our federal counterparts. There are components of those highway upgrades that are part of that. With Highway No. 103, the Ingramport interchange is a key piece of infrastructure that we are currently proceeding with, with the intent that we would build the twinning from metro and meet up with that interchange. That is an important section of Highway No. 103. The threshold for full twinning is about 10,000 vehicles per day, and that section of Highway No. 103 meets that criteria. We are moving aggressively with that, building the Ingramport interchange with the hope that the feds will partner with us on that specific portion.</p>
<p>With respect to Highway No. 101, there are a number of pieces along the entire Highway No. 101 which we are engaging with our federal counterparts as well. There are some short-term measures that we can take to improve safety, and we're working with members from all sides of the House on some of those short-term measures, but with respect to the long-term measures, that again will be subject to the discussion with the federal members. I would like to acknowledge the MLA for Digby, who has been very strong in representing his community on those issues. Again, we're working on those as best we can.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the member for Clare-Digby has been doing yet, but I know the previous member for Digby would have spoken really passionately about Highway No. 101, with completing Highway No. 101. He would have spoken about alders, as well, but I'm sure this one is important to him too. I hope the new member takes that up with you as well.</p>
<p>The issue I do want to talk about specifically is the intersection to the Pubnicos. I know the Minister of Natural Resources knows it well. As you come down that highway, there are a lot of level crossings, and probably the most fishing product, the highest value of fishing product in all of Canada comes out of the port in Lower West Pubnico. A lot of those trucks are turning off the highway onto Highway No. 103 and causing a bit of a problem. If you can imagine that kind of traffic hitting a flat intersection, it's very difficult.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to ask you the question that maybe in your discussions there can be an ask of the federal government or of others that we look at an intersection for that specific intersection, a real intersection with a bridge intersection and all, because it is getting quite dangerous and I'm getting a lot of phone calls about it.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, when we travelled down the South Shore and we took Highway No. 101 down and took Highway No. 103 back to the city, that was a particular area that was of very significant interest to both the deputy minister, Paul LaFleche and chief engineer, Bruce Fitzner. They pointed out the inherent dangers in that area, particularly when there's heavy volume using that corridor and certainly that intersection.</p>
<p>I think that is a conversation that we'll continue to have. Again, as the member understands and as pointed out, that is certainly something that will take a significant investment. For us, that could be on the table as the MLAs in the area offer their opinions on what should be the focus, we certainly take that seriously. Of course, the input from the Members of Parliament from that way, the regional minister, Peter MacKay, and the federal counterparts that would have some influence over that money.</p>
<p>Certainly, for us, again, I've said it many times but I'll repeat it, this is all about road safety and the priorities that make sense and keep people safe, keep the economy going and keep commuting happening in Nova Scotia. For us, we'll take all the advice from the experts and we'll invest those limited funds that we have to make sense and make sure people are as safe as possible when they use our highways.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont">
            <from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from>
            <p>You know, if I'm talking about that intersection, I should talk about the Argyle intersection as well, which is, I think, an engineering nightmare. How engineers can design something and forget about another road, and basically that's what happened in that area. I know the minister knows it well. As well, as they put a turning lane for one, they impeded themselves on the access to another. So you have people turning one way to go to Nakile Home for Special Care and you have people turning the other way to go to the high school. It needs to be redesigned once again, be addressed because there are far too many almost-accidents - thank goodness there's not accidents happening, but we've come close a whole bunch of times. I hope the department does address that when they can.</p>
