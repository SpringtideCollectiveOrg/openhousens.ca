        <speech by="#22119b83-0505-4c62-95ff-e8c0e378764c"><from>MR. JIM MORTON</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I'm glad we got that clarified. I'm happy to rise in my place to speak to Resolution No. 953, something which I read to this House last week. It deals with CAP sites, federally-funded, Community Access Program sites and provincially-funded sites which have been in existence in this province and across Canada since 1995.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, you may be well aware that in Nova Scotia there are and have been for the last while about 209 CAP sites spread in communities from end to end in this province, in the larger centres, in tiny places and all are important.</p>
<p>The federal government has - last year indicates that in the fiscal year 2011-12 - funded CAP sites in this province to the tune of $740,263. That was matched or combined with some provincial support of $340,000 from the Government of Nova Scotia, funding which made it possible to keep these 209 centres open and running.</p>
<p>I guess the reason I'm standing in my place to talk about this - which I think everyone in this House knows - is that the federal government - it's hard for me to hear with the noise in this House.</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
          <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
          <p>Order, please. The honourable member for Kings North has the floor.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#22119b83-0505-4c62-95ff-e8c0e378764c"><from>MR. MORTON</from><p>Thank you. As I was saying, the federal government has decided to discontinue its support for this funding, and I think that's unfortunate. In fact, the announcement of the discontinuation of that funding was delivered in a rather cynical way. Late in the evening of Thursday, April 5<sup>th</sup>, you will remember - as all my colleagues in this House will remember - that was the evening before a long weekend that began with Good Friday. The federal government sent a letter to CAP site officials across the country advising them that the program, which had been in place for more than 10 years, would be discontinued.</p>
<p>I think that decision tends to fail to recognize the value of those Community Access Program sites. These are valuable community resources. They contribute to economic development by giving everyone in the community access to information. They're an important social resource, because they allow people to connect with family and friends, to make contact with the services they need throughout the community, and in fact, throughout the world.</p>
<p>In many cases what they've done is help introduce older Nova Scotians, in particular, to the world of computer technology and help them become more comfortable with a modern means of being in touch with each other. They've certainly created a means of access for economically disadvantaged or poor Nova Scotians, for those people who may be temporarily poor because they're unemployed and don't have the means to provide themselves with that kind of computer access. Those people who are receiving income assistance, or who maybe are living on minimum wage, have found a Community Access Centre as one of the important ways of staying in touch with the wider world.</p>
<p>People use these centres for a variety of means. Some people might use these centres because they need to do banking; others might find it one of the ways that they can communicate with government - perhaps to file their income tax. It can be a way for people to access health information, which many of us might do from our homes. It can become a way for those people who are unemployed to actually conduct a meaningful job search and stay in touch with the range of jobs that might be available in a community.</p>
<p>It certainly - and I don't think this can be downplayed at all, and it shouldn't be - becomes a way for individuals to maintain family and social contacts. I think it's important for us to understand that in the kind of world we live in, where families have become dispersed, where individuals who may have started out in one part of the country now live in another, the Internet, social media, has become one of the ways in which we communicate with each other. That sense of being in touch with the people we care about, with the people who matter to us, is one of the ways in which we measure our well-being and in which we are able to participate in a full and meaningful way in our community.</p>
<p>In a very practical way, even young people who may be quite computer literate may be part of a family that cannot afford a computer, and this may become one of the ways, through being able to access a CAP site at a library or some other community centre, they're able to do their homework. Certainly this has been, in a general sense &#x2026;</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MADAM SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. It's becoming increasingly hard to hear. The chatter is very loud. If you could just keep it down a little bit or perhaps take it out of the Chamber.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Kings North has the floor.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#22119b83-0505-4c62-95ff-e8c0e378764c"><from>MR. MORTON</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. Encouraging computer literacy is an important goal in our society. It continues to be an important objective and it's one we have not yet completed. One of the things that have been documented regularly, but has been certainly documented and publicized since the federal government announced its intention to discontinue this program is that there were 500,000 hours of CAP site Internet time logged in the fiscal year that just ended. The usage numbers over the years since 1995, when the program was implemented, have either remained stable or escalated. There has been no indication that the interest in this program has diminished.</p>
<p>But, Madam Speaker, one of the facts is that without federal support, some of these - maybe all of these but certainly some of these - Community Access Program sites will close. I think of the area that I represent where there are CAP sites in Kingsport, Canning, Kentville or Port Williams, of those people who make use of these resources on a regular basis, some who have learned, and are learning, to use the Internet resources through those locations, when I think of those cases I certainly understand that this is an important resource.</p>
<p>It's not only in Kings North, Madam Speaker, that there are important issues. If one were in Barss Corner in the middle of our province, or in Pugwash, one would also be wondering how they would access resources like this. If one were in Louisbourg, one might be asking about resources like this, and you know my colleague, the member for Pictou East, was mentioning to me just earlier today that he recalls his own time living in the Louisbourg area where the children of people who worked in fish plants were primary users of CAP sites in the local library, using the CAP site as a way to get their homework done, as a way to stay in touch with the world, as a way to get a leg up in the world when their parents couldn't afford to offer that directly through their own home.</p>
<p>CAP sites are not only about simply access to computers, they are about all those things which make it difficult for people who have less income to get access to the resources they need. For somebody who has low income, they may not have good access to telephone services. They may not have adequate transportation; they may not be able to afford even to buy a computer let alone to pay Internet fees. This becomes one of the ways that those disadvantaged people can access the world. For people who run libraries, for librarians and library technicians, the computers and the CAP sites located at the those sites become an important part of the network of resources that libraries offer.</p>
<p>I think probably every member of this House is aware that there are pockets of people who are not experiencing issues with income, who don't have access to adequate Internet because broadband Internet has not yet reached every member of our community. In my own constituency of Kings North there are a number of people who live on the North Mountain of Kings North, a number of people who live under the North Mountain who could well afford broadband Internet services but who cannot access them because, technically, it is not yet possible to provide them. Those people also make use of CAP sites as a way to stay in touch with things that are important to them.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we haven't been inactive on this side of the House on this issue; we've committed ourselves to continue providing the provincial portion of this funding. We are hopeful that that funding will enable CAP sites to continue to do as much work as they can. Mr. Eric Stackhouse, who is the Nova Scotia CAP chair, has been leading the provincial effort to reinstate the national funding. I think we have to commend Mr. Stackhouse's work - work, which in the past actually, has been effective in discouraging federal intents to reduce, cut back or eliminate this program.</p>
<p>On our own side of the House, Madam Speaker, the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism has written his colleague in Ottawa, the Honourable Christian Paradis, the Minister of Industry, encouraging Mr. Paradis to rethink his position on this whole issue and pointed out the reasons that he should do that, some of which I've highlighted here today.</p>
<p>I read a resolution in this House, Madam Speaker, just last week, asking my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party to do their part to help take up the cause with their federal, maybe-not-so-progressive counterparts. The member for Argyle, the member for Hants West, the member for Inverness, the member for Victoria-The Lakes, the members for Cape Breton West and Cape Breton North, the member for Cumberland South, all of those members could certainly be helpful. Obviously I would expect they would have better contacts than we might have on our side with some of those key people who might be able to help influence Mr. Paradis and those people who have influence in the federal Cabinet and the federal decision making regarding this issue, which is not significant when it's compared with many other things in terms of its financial cost but has a tremendous benefit for those people who are the poorest among us.</p>
<p>Again, Madam Speaker, I do want to say that while there are many more people in 2012 that have access to computer services and Internet access in their own homes, that number has risen to 79 per cent. What that means, while that is an amazing number in a short time, it still means that there are 21 per cent of Canadians who do not have computer access in their own homes. I would suggest that by and large, despite those people who don't have access because of gaps in broadband and the like, those 21 per cent tend to be the people among us who need the largest hand-up, who need to be given every tool they can to take part in the society of which they are entitled to be a part.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think that CAP sites provide one of the means of doing that. So I think that at this point I've said what I intended to say and I will take my seat. I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue and to encourage all of us and, in fact, to encourage Nova Scotians throughout the province, to do their part in encouraging the federal government to encourage a reversal of this decision. Certainly, as I've said, I encourage my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party to lead the way in that effort. Thank you.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. So the CAP sites, better late than never. The CAP site program was started in 1995 at a time when the federal government was going through severe budget cuts but they felt that this program was incredibly important to Canadians, to the Canadian economy, to job searches, et cetera. Back then, 40 per cent of Canadian households had computers, 10 per cent of those had Internet. Today, 79 per cent have Internet, but that doesn't mean that the CAP site program should be cut.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm looking here at a letter to the editor in the Hants Journal. It says: "Conservative government must restore CAP funding":</p>
<blockquote>"Many Nova Scotians will be hurt by the Conservative government's decision to stop funding Community Access Programs (CAP) in hundreds of communities.
<p>CAP sites are used for employment searches and to help seniors and students access government services online. Others rely on CAP to stay connected with family and friends.</p>
<p>And staff at CAP sites provide computer training to individuals and businesses to help them take advantage of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>The decision to stop funding this program will mean many low-income families will continue to be at an educational and economic disadvantage.</p>
<p>I believe we need to do everything we can to convince the Harper government to restore CAP funding and to do it now!"</p></blockquote>
<p>It is signed Geoff Regan, MP for Halifax West. So because I always listen to my husband, I wanted to participate in today's debate and, in fact, I do believe I've read a resolution on this previously because I believe this is an important program.</p>
<p>In fact, the member for Halifax West's point that the decision to stop funding this program will mean many low-income families will mean many low income families will continue to be at an educational and economic disadvantage is exactly my point. The people who are continuing to use these sites are often - well, they're often poor. They can't afford to have a computer and Internet access at home. They're often elderly or homeless, or they're unemployed, or travelers from out-of-town and they just need a place to check in and let people know what's going on and find out what's going on in the world.</p>
<p>I have to say that I know people who use the CAP site to do their Internet work. Not all of us have Internet sites at home and sometimes you're going through a period where you just can't afford it. Or you're living in a place for a brief period of time and it doesn't make economic sense to set that up, and you have this particular service which has been helpful. You really have to ask yourself why the federal government chose right before a long weekend, a four-day long weekend, to hack that program. You know that if it was a positive decision, they would have been out front with pictures and cameras and announcements but instead they did it, trying to fly underneath the radar. In fact some of the organizations that had their funding cut didn't even know about the cut right away because they weren't at work when it happened.</p>
<p>Anybody who works in a rural community with small business or with low income people knows that the losing the CAP sites is a problem and significantly the decision to chop this program was made without consultation. Nobody called up the CAP sites and said, is there a better way to do this, is there something we can do? According to an article from the Annapolis County Spectator, they were never consulted about this. They've asked for discussions on how to adjust the program to meet government priorities. You have to ask yourself, what does the government think people are doing on those particular sites? We know from talking to CAP volunteers that people are looking for jobs online. CAP volunteers help seniors file for income tax. They help laid-off workers apply for EI online and they work with community groups on projects that require online research or even the printing of a final project if they've been working on it.</p>
<p>Some people come in and they have their resumes done up and the CAP volunteers are actually helping them. They may need some assistance with literacy issues and the CAP volunteers are doing that. That service is going to be lost without the funding from the federal government which wasn't huge in per site per dollar, in terms of dollars, but what it was - it often paid to keep the heat on, to keep the lights on. We weren't paying the volunteers, we are talking about just actually running the computers and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>If you look at the federal government's rationale for chopping this, they said that it launched, as I said, in 1995 but then they went on to say it has met its objectives. Well, what were those objectives - to help poor people find their jobs? Poor people are still trying to find jobs, poor people are still trying to access programs. People are still trying to file for EI. They are still trying to file for their income tax on the CAP sites, so how they could conclude that their objectives have been met, when in fact usage has continued to climb year over year, is beyond me. For the federal government to say many more have accessed through their mobile devices, suggesting that, you know, and I believe it was a federal minister who said, well, people can just get it on their iPhone. Well, lots of people don't have iPhones and lots of people don't have cellphones and this program is penalizing them. It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now, when I was at the Law Amendments Committee meeting awhile ago, I did ask - no, it wasn't the Law Amendments Committee, pardon me. It was Budget Estimates and I did ask the Minister for Communities, Culture and Heritage - would this government increase the funding to help make up the shortfall from the federal government? We did not hear that they were going to increase their funding, so once again I would say that this government has it within their power to allocate resources to this needed program if the government wants it to continue. If the government feels this program is important, it can increase the money to it.</p>
<p>Heaven knows I don't want to let the federal government off the hook, but if you believe, if one believes that this program is important, there is something that can be done about it, and the government members have it within their power. As the Leader of my Party often says, this government doesn't have a revenue problem; it has a priority problem. It could decide to make the CAP sites a priority.</p>
<p>Now that I have complained that the NDP isn't funding the program and the Conservatives aren't funding the program, I think I've made my point and I'll take my seat. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>I have to say, I think it was great in a way that the backbenchers of the NDP had the opportunity to speak. We don't hear from the member for Kings North very often. It was a great opportunity for him to come up and speak tonight and to bring up the issue of CAP sites in this House on the back of a resolution that's presented when this government should be presenting government business. Government business that we can all discuss like bills and laws and regulations - things that are important to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>How about talking about things that are important, like jobs? How about talking about power rates? How about talking about taxes? Those are the things that this House should be used for, not frivolous resolutions on the floor of this House. (Applause)</p>
<p>Let me speak quickly to CAP sites for a minute before I go on to other discussions that I think we should be talking about in this House of Assembly. We have a wonderful CAP site in the Mus&#xE9;e acadien de Pubnico-Ouest, a beautiful CAP site that's been used for years. Since they put it in, it has helped out hundreds of people. Do I think it should stay there? Absolutely, I do think it should be there. The one in Tusket at the Centre Communautaire - do I think that one should be there? Absolutely. You know what? I took the opportunity to talk to my MP, and I took the opportunity to send a few e-mails around. That's the job that I, as an MLA, can do.</p>
<p>Maybe they don't feel that they can do those kinds of things, but they have the opportunity to talk to MPs across this province from one end to another.

I had the opportunity to meet with a few of them this morning, but I had to get on the road to be here at 4:00 p.m. to do the business of this House of Assembly, to find out that less than an hour into that procedure, we call a resolution, a government resolution, to debate CAP sites.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm not diminishing the issue of CAP sites. I think they are important, and I think it's one we should work toward, making sure that they stay in areas of Nova Scotia, but what we should be talking about and what the member for Kings North should be talking about is the jobs that have been lost in the Annapolis Valley. Since this government has taken government, the Valley has lost 5,800 jobs. Why isn't the member talking about that? Why isn't he talking within his Party to find more opportunities for people in the Valley?</p>
<p>That's what we should be talking about on the floor of this Legislature, Madam Speaker. I think if the government is really concerned about rural Nova Scotia, they'd be doing something to stop the bleeding. Under the NDP this government has lost 21,000 full-time jobs. Why aren't we talking about that issue on the floor? (Interruption)</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance is speaking over there, why doesn't he get up and talk about it? He knows there are job losses in Nova Scotia. I want him to tell me how many jobs - if it's not 21,000 jobs, why doesn't he tell me how many jobs have actually been lost in Nova Scotia? It's not anything less than zero; it's a heck of a lot more than zero. Is it 10,000 jobs? Is it 15,000 jobs? You know what, it's got to be more than 18,000 jobs. Why doesn't he talk about those things?</p>
<p>This is what this government wanted to bring in. The Deputy Government House Leader brought this resolution forward and we can talk about it until the end of the evening, if he wants. I'm sure there are lots of great ideas that we want to be talking about in resolutions but again, there's been job losses from one end of this province to the other. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, if he wants to get up and speak, I'll let him take some time. He wants to take some time. If he looks at southwestern Nova Scotia, how many jobs in southwestern Nova Scotia, how many jobs in Yarmouth County have there been lost? How many jobs in Shelburne County have been lost? How many jobs in Digby County have been lost? How many jobs in Annapolis County have been lost? How many jobs in Kings County have been lost? How many jobs in Colchester North? Cumberland South?</p>
<p>Which county do you want me to talk about? All right, great, here in HRM they've gotten jobs. Wonderful, I'm glad things are going well&#x2026;</p></speech>

        <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>I apologize but he's given me so much to talk about that it's hard not to fall into that kind of rabbit track, to once again tell the member why he's wrong in this particular case. Maybe the overall number looks rosy to him but when we see the regional disparity that's happening in this province, where there are jobs missing - not just the jobs that we're missing, Madam Speaker. It's the people, in my estimation, who made our community strong. We don't have them anymore because they had to move on to other places.</p>
<p>Maybe they are here in HRM and I'm glad they were able to remain in Nova Scotia but I know they're not here either. They are in Alberta, they are in Ontario, they are in other provinces in this country and other places abroad. I think that is a shame because that's the kind of thing we should be talking about on the floor of this Legislature, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>You know it's funny, and again to go to the job issue, this government took over at the end of a recession and since that time the employment rate is 1.9 per cent lower than when they took power. Places like the South Shore have seen employment rates drop by 5.8 per cent since this government took power. So why don't we find a nice resolution to talk about those kinds of things? You know why? Because this government really doesn't want to talk about it. Maybe they don't go out and talk to the people that we talk to, but do you know what? I think it's going to continue to show.</p>
<p>I'm going to bring back a line that maybe the member - no, the previous member for Cape Breton North and I apologize to the current member - used many times. It's time that this failed Socialist experiment ends. It's time we start listening to Nova Scotians for once, rather than just sort of flying by the seat of your pants, making things up and hoping that people are going to buy the baloney that you've made up.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think there's a lot of things we should be talking about. Once again, I thank the member for Kings North for bringing this to the floor, which gives me an opportunity to talk about the ineffectiveness of this government. At this time I'll take my place and I'll adjourn debate on this resolution.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Lunenburg.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#aefec392-99d6-4923-8d87-227e50d567e8"><from>MS. PAM BIRDSALL</from><p>Madam Speaker, I would like to read my resolution which says:</p>
<p>"Whereas Nova Scotia is honoured to be the home of many National Historic Sites such as the Fortress Louisbourg, which was rebuilt to interpret and maintain the historic presence of this important French settlement and military installation; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site employs hundreds of local residents as tour guides, interpreters, archaeologists, carpenters and engineers, whose jobs provide vital economic investment in the Town of Louisbourg and also the surrounding rural community; and</p>
<p>Whereas the federal government has recently announced that 1,689 employees at Parks Canada will be "affected" by the $5.2 billion job reduction strategy, and 120 positions specifically at Fortress Louisbourg will either be eliminated or face a reduction of hours;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that this House of Assembly encourage the member for Cape Breton West to contact his colleagues within the federal Conservative Party to stress the importance of the job losses at Fortress Louisbourg and the impact that the loss of these jobs will have on this vital and historic rural community."</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this obviously is going to have a devastating effect on the area. Federal cuts that will look at eliminating 10 jobs and reducing the hours of 120 jobs in a town of 1,265 people is really going to have an impact. We know that Fortress Louisbourg is such an important historic park and one that is the flagship in Canadian park systems. The town is right next to the park and people drive through the town with their shops, B&amp;Bs and bakeries, and all these people will be affected in a negative way. Local restaurants, gift shops and hotels will be affected by a shorter season. The danger, of course, for most of these seasonal workers, if their time is cut back, they very well may not be able to qualify for Employment Insurance which will be another huge factor in the area.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I realize that Fortress of Louisbourg is historically a destination where people come from all over the world, certainly all over Canada, and I remember in the 1960s when the restoration first began, I was a young girl and my mother and father and brother and I packed up our car for our family vacation and went to Louisbourg. At the time there were very few buildings, they were actually just using all sorts of string and marking it all out to show where the buildings would go. Over the years people have been brought in from all over the world to work on this historic reproduction and it is drawing people who are interested in historic re-enactments and just to see what the world was like in the 1700s.</p>
<p>The buildings themselves are so beautiful and I know that some of them, like one of the biggest ones, the biggest building - the King's Bastion, thank you. At the time when it was built, it was one of the biggest buildings in North America. I know families and individuals but also school trips are one of those magical things that happens when people go to Louisbourg. I have a friend who had a wonderful experience when she went there with a school trip. She was telling me the way it all worked and she said I remember getting off my school bus and walking into the Interpretive Centre with my classmates. We watched short videos about the history which built the excitement of our day trip. Then we boarded the fortress bus because vehicles were not allowed to go to the fortress, this helps preserve the landscape which is full of shrubs and wetlands and grassy hills.</p>
<p>I do understand that apparently these buses will be eliminated so people will be driving now right to the fort. So that will also be a questionable impact in a negative way on this area that they're talking about. She went on to say that when they got to the fortress they got off the bus and before they entered a traditional 1744 house, they were just amazed.</p>
<p>She said the roof was made of grass and dirt. The floor was also dirt, and the woman in the house was cooking with an open flame, washing clothes in a bucket. She was dressed in what appeared to be a warm dress with an apron and a hat. The animator who was playing the husband was chopping wood outside. The beds were very small, made of blankets covering hay. When she went to this area and looked at all of this, these people who would be the interpreters in these buildings now, a lot of these jobs will be cut back in hours and some eliminated entirely.</p>
<p>She was talking about how the magic of this place affected her. She said, once the gates of the fortress - and the animator playing the guard told them the story of how the English invaded, about how they all had to say a French word, which was a password, to let them into the fortress. Once inside, she said she felt as if she'd gone back in time. This sort of magical experience that my friend had is one of the reasons that this is such an amazing spot, this park and all that it does for the local area's economy, but it's not just that. It's the kind of impact it has on someone's life.</p>
<p>In our world right now - we were speaking earlier about CAP sites and Internet sites and people being involved in our fast modern world, and to be able to go to a place like Fortress of Louisbourg, to step back in time, to look at the way they did things, is all so wonderful for people to actually see where we progressed as a society, and have we actually progressed?</p>
<p>I know that food is one of the wonderful things at Fortress of Louisbourg. People come away talking about having a gastronomic memory of their visit. They talk about wonderful breads that are cooked right there, hard-crusted breads, and wonderful stews and the kinds of food they would have had at the time. Very, very different from our over-processed non-food that most of us are eating these days.</p>
<p>I know that as visitors come each year to the fortress, they explore it in different ways. Through the process of the restoration, archaeological students would go in the summers and work there, and it was an amazing treat for them to go and see what they could do and how they could be part of this wild restoration that was a project at the time. When it started in the 1960s, I remember people were shaking their heads and saying, what kind of a crazy thing is this to do? Obviously it was a wonderful investment.</p>
<p>I went back to Fortress of Louisbourg in the mid-1970s - my second honeymoon - and saw a lot of progress at that point. Many buildings were built at that point, and it was really quite a wonderful thing. It changed considerably from the 1960s where it was mostly an open field, and I remember when I was there in the 1960s with my family it was a magical kind of day, very thick fog, and it felt much like it would have to the soldiers at the time.</p>
<p>All the restorations that have happened involve so many people. All the clothing that they wear is made in the area. The whole town, the area, is involved. In the Spring, when the park opens, the town springs to life and young children act as volunteers. They volunteer by dressing in the old clothes as children of the time. They would play with balls and rocks and make instruments of their own creation and play the way children would have at that time - very, very different, and a wonderful thing for whole families in the area to be able to be involved in the economy.</p>
<p>To cut jobs like this in an area that is so small will have major economic effects on Louisbourg. I know that a lot of the people in the area right now are just sort of shuffling about seeing what is really going to happen, how long will the season actually be? These things have to be nailed down so that they can see what impacts there will be further than what they already do expect.</p>
<p>Also, in Parks Canada Regional Headquarters in Upper Water Street, Halifax, those jobs also will be heavily slashed. Apparently there will be 34 employees gone at that location as well. So it's far-reaching and deep cuts. I think the people of Louisbourg are a resilient bunch, they are Nova Scotians. We are all a resilient group of people and we'll deal with what is dealt to us, and yet I certainly do hope that we can all encourage the federal Party to look at not cutting any further jobs and looking at the real devastation that these cuts have impacted. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a5e0e841-506b-4c0b-a88e-c09691bd745b"><from>HON. MANNING MACDONALD</from><p>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I'd like to thank the member for Lunenburg for taking us down memory lane with Louisbourg. It's interesting that the NDP is so devoid of business in this House that they have to have the member for Lunenburg talk about the situation in Cape Breton West. While I respected everything the member said, I think my friend from Cape Breton West will have something further to say about Louisbourg - I'm sure about that.</p>
<p>You know, Madam Speaker, I'm glad the subject has hit the floor in regard to Louisbourg because there are certain things happening at Louisbourg that I don't like and there are certain things happening to our economy. I would hope that the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, who is in the House, would pay attention to some of the suggestions we may have here. If there's one word that's missing when it comes to that great icon in Cape Breton, it's marketing.</p>
<p>I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that if there's anything we need, it's a marketing strategy for the Fortress of Louisbourg and for the future. Louisbourg should be a thriving town today. It should be something like some of the American places where their history - they have made money off of history. As well as preserving some of the legacy of history, they've also made money. One place comes to mind that in my opinion doesn't have half the historical significance of Fortress Louisbourg but it's the Alamo, for example, in the United States. Millions of people visit the Alamo every year and the United States tourism people in that part of the country do very well off it.</p>
<p>I've said, Madam Speaker, many times, to anybody who would listen to me wherever I was at, is in Cape Breton what we need to do is - and while I respect Parks Canada and the archaeological features that are out there and the historical implications - I humbly suggest that what we need to be doing with Louisbourg is selling, not digging up rocks but selling them. I think what we have to do is market that fort for the future.</p>
<p>It's something that is sitting there. It's a national, if not an international icon, that is terribly unused, Madam Speaker. It needs, in conjunction with Parks Canada, it needs a strategy from Parks Canada to, yes, beef up their ranks and I agree with the member for Lunenburg who laments the fact that some people working for Parks Canada are being laid off. I suggest that they should be rehired and I suggest with a different purpose. We should be hiring them to go out and start encouraging the private sector. If the government doesn't want to do it then the private sector should do it in marketing Louisbourg.</p>
<p>That goes, for example, for the Highlands; it goes for the Bell Museum in Baddeck; it goes for all our important icons that could, in and of themselves, make the economy of Cape Breton one heck of a lot better than it is right now. I don't think there's any place anywhere that has the kind of historical significance that Cape Breton Island has when it comes to Bell and everything that went along - what did they say about Baddeck? Baddeck is the equivalent, I guess, of Bar Harbor, Maine, in terms of its importance, but the problem with Baddeck is that it's two months of the year. What we have to do is encourage more people to go to the Bell Museum to see the Bell exhibit.</p>
<p>If anybody on the other side of the House, or even on this side, has not been to the Bell Museum, I suggest that you should take a trip down there and see the exhibits there with Alexander Graham Bell and the invention of the telephone, of course, and the early flights that took place on Baddeck Bay. When you go to Louisbourg the historical significance of the battles that used to take place and the falling of the fort, the French versus the English, firing cannons at one another. We should be still doing that every Friday out there in season; we should have people coming to these battles - you could even get the member for Richmond and me to coach each team.</p>
<p>But, seriously, Madam Speaker, Fort Louisbourg is a national historic site. I can recall, just to digress for a moment, about the Highlands, also in Cape Breton, in the riding of Inverness - and Victoria, I guess, or both probably - anyway I've never seen much publicity, great publicity, about a golf course that the Highlands has and it has reached Cond&#xE9; Nast magazine, it reached national golf productions, and all this kind of stuff. But you know what? A few years ago the marketing was so slow down there that we were in danger of losing it, because of losing interest from people coming from away because you couldn't even get a golf cart there for years, and the days of the caddy were gone so you had to truck your clubs around that course and if anybody has tried to do that over the few years they better be in better shape than I was at the time.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that it was inside Parks Canada property - and one of the things that used to infuriate me back, by the way, when I was Minister of Development and was taking people to look at some facilities there, was I would take them in the park and while we were playing golf somebody would ticket our cars, because you had to go through a certain way to get into the parking and while you were paying green fees somebody was putting a ticket on your car. So that wasn't a good marketing strategy for the Americans over there, that's for sure. I suggest that Parks Canada, while they are a very important part of the federal scene, I think they should be turning their attention, Madam Speaker, to marketing in Cape Breton and I give those three examples.</p>
<p>Really, I thank the member for Lunenburg for talking about Louisbourg and suggesting what a wonderful trip she had down there, her honeymoon I believe she said, and I couldn't think of a better place than Louisbourg - the weather is always so good there. My good friend, the member for Cape Breton West will attest to that.</p>
<p>I can recall though, Madam Speaker, being frustrated from time to time at knowing what a wonderful icon we have there and it is not being marketed. I see nothing wrong with the provincial minister talking to his federal counterparts or the Parks Canada people about perhaps encouraging a private sector company such as Disney, or one of those, to come to Cape Breton and take a look at that icon we have there, and perhaps get involved along with Parks Canada in marketing Louisbourg.</p>
<p>It is something, I think, that could remake the Town of Louisbourg, a town that is no longer a town - one person out there said it's an "occupied town," Allister MacDonald. I don't think they even have a gas station out there anymore in the town. That's terrible, a national icon sitting in its midst. The reason is there is no traffic there; I've taken some people out to Louisbourg and there is nobody there. They have buses to take you down to the fort and the buses are empty more than they're filled. The season is so short, but there is something missing when that's allowed to happen to a national historic icon like Fort Louisbourg.</p>
<p>So I suggest it's an unsolicited ask, I guess, from the provincial minister that perhaps the provincial government, with the help of, hopefully, all three Parties, could talk to federal officials and federal ministers regarding a future strategy for Fort Louisbourg, and the other two icons of Cape Breton that I talked about - particularly Louisbourg. I think that area of Cape Breton could get quite a shot in the arm if we had a rejuvenated facility there, something that people would talk about, go back and talk to their people in the United States, in Britain, or wherever they are coming from - the tourists - to visit these historic sites. I believe that there are certainly enough animators around Cape Breton and they could probably have a role to play in doing something with marketing in the future.</p>
<p>I'm going to take my place in a moment, but I would very seriously say that I think the time has come for us to forget about the status quo, as it comes to Louisbourg, and to get into a marketing situation there that will bring that facility back to what I think it deserves. It will be a huge employer in the area and I believe it would breathe new life into Louisbourg and the surrounding areas and, indeed, the whole Province of Nova Scotia. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I'm pleased to be able to stand today and say a few words about the resolution from the member for Lunenburg regarding the Fortress of Louisbourg. Her resolution is the most information we've heard from that government on the Fortress of Louisbourg since I've been here.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I actually worked as a soldier in the Fortress of Louisbourg. I spent some time there. I want to qualify that and let you know it wasn't at the original time, it was in later years. (Laughter) There is no question that the Fortress of Louisbourg is a very important icon in the Province of Nova Scotia and it has created a lot of employment for a lot of people over the years. As a matter of fact, my father-in-law worked at the Fortress of Louisbourg for over 25 years and he was a hewer. He took round logs and he changed them into square building beams and they used them in the recreation of the building. So there has been a lot of activity and a lot of closeness of the Fortress of Louisbourg in our household and it's very important, when you think about what was done.</p>
<p>If we go back in history, we look at the fact that it was started by the Diefenbaker Government as a way to find employment for miners who were losing their jobs in the coal mines of Cape Breton at the time and it was meant as a reason to improve what was going on, so people would know part of our history. Those things have taken place.</p>
<p>I heard the member for Lunenburg talk about there might be some challenges with people actually driving over to the fortress, instead of taking the buses. Well, the roads going to the fortress are quite good. They are excellent, first-class roads so that nobody will be going into the different areas where there are still some archaeological issues that we are looking after.</p>
<p>The fortress also has been very important for a lot of young people in the Province of Nova Scotia, not just on Cape Breton Island but from all over. They have a kids' volunteer program where they get to live and work on the site and act as drummers and pipers and do other types of things all around the site, and get a real sense of what the history of the Fortress of Louisbourg was all about.</p>
<p>The work and the number of people employed - they're not just from Louisbourg, Madam Speaker, they are from all over the island. There are people there from all over the island.</p>
<p>Now I don't know if the member for Lunenburg spoke to the superintendent, but on May 2<sup>nd</sup> when the announcement was made, I did speak to the superintendent. There are no layoffs. There are 10 people - a number of positions where there are retirements but there are no layoffs. There are reductions in hours but in those reductions in hours they have made sure that the seasonal workers will get at least 16 weeks, which currently would qualify them for unemployment. Those things were taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Was it an easy decision? I'm sure it wasn't, but I do know that they worked at it, and if you are a person who had a 12-month job and you're going back to a seven-month job, that's not easy either, because your life has been determined on 12 months of salary, so there are some concerns from the community. But for the member to say that there were job losses, I don't think that's correct and that may be because he never got the proper information. That happens easily enough in our business and we all know that.</p>
<p>What I really think - and the member for Cape Breton South spoke about marketing. Well, one of the first things I did on May 2<sup>nd</sup> is I actually wrote a letter to the federal minister and I'm hoping that our provincial Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism did the same thing. I wrote a letter to our federal minister asking him to reconsider the cuts at the Fortress of Louisbourg, and if he couldn't reconsider those cuts, at the very least invest more money in marketing because I, like the member for Cape Breton South and many people on Cape Breton Island, will tell you that the marketing for that fortress is poor. It is very poor.</p>
<p>I remember as a kid watching advertisements on TV and they would show the fortress and there would be &#x2026;</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
            <p>Was the fortress built then?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>And there were even TVs then. The member for Glace Bay was wondering if there was a fortress then. Well, he would have been one of the ones - no.</p>
<p>They used to advertise, and there would be a picture of the fortress and it was foggy and rainy and they were playing this eerie music that you would hear in a funeral home, and they were saying "Come to Louisbourg." Well, it wasn't a great incentive. I'm sure it wasn't an ad like that that got the member for Lunenburg there on her honeymoon, but we do need to improve how we sell the icon of North America.</p>
<p>You know, at one point it was the biggest recreation in all of North America, and now it's the biggest recreation of an historic site in Canada. We haven't been marketing it well, and I don't believe that the Province of Nova Scotia has been doing a good job of marketing it either. They'll say, well, you know, it's a federal site. Well, everybody who comes into Nova Scotia is helping our economy.</p>
<p>If we have an icon like the Fortress of Louisbourg that we can take advantage of, on the number one island in North America - which again, we should be taking advantage of, as the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism - and the third-most beautiful island in all the world - and we're not taking advantage of those things that are given to us simple and easy, that don't cost us any money. The provincial government is failing. They love to advertise. Well, now, here's an opportunity to promote a product.</p>
<p>The problem from that side of the House seems to be, Madam Speaker, that they don't have any initiative. They don't know how to be leaders. They have been in Opposition for 11 years - as one of the members mentioned the other day - and now they're starting to get back in Opposition with the way they're acting toward some of the most important things in this province.</p>
<p>We are sitting here today and I can't believe that we're debating resolutions in business hours of the House of Assembly. We have the highest power rates in all of Canada. We have higher taxes than anywhere else. We've got Bill No. 102 that this government put into place. (Interruption) The member - again, the Minister of Agriculture has all the answers, except during Question Period. During Question Period he's void of answers. He doesn't have a clue what to say.</p>
<p>The reality is here we are today talking about a very important institution, the Fortress of Louisbourg, but there are many other things that people around home are talking about. The member for Lunenburg talked about the restaurants, the gift shops, and the hotels in Louisbourg, and how they're struggling to keep their doors open. They're also struggling because of the power rates that are being charged, because of the extra 2 per cent on the HST that this government put in place. They're struggling to keep their doors open and to keep people working, because it is very expensive to do work in the Province of Nova Scotia - a province that only had 0.3 per cent growth in the GDP.</p>
<p>This is the same government that cut the funding to the ferry in Yarmouth, and you would say to me, well, what does that have to do with the Fortress of Louisbourg? Do you know that 40 per cent of the bus traffic that came to Cape Breton came across on that ferry? They would have been going to visit the Fortress of Louisbourg, but that government decided, no, we're not going to bother doing that anymore.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I could go on for a long time, and most of the people here understand and know that, but here we are. (Interruptions) Excuse me, did somebody call me stupid? Somebody did. That's what I heard over here.</p>
<p>Well, do you know what, Madam Speaker? I might be a lot of things, but I will tell you that when it comes to talking about something as important to the economy of the Province of Nova Scotia as the Fortress of Louisbourg, I don't care what people call me. What I do care about is the fact that the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism of the Province of Nova Scotia is not doing his share to keep this open. A Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism should not be writing letters - if he even did that. He should be in Ottawa talking to the federal minister, talking to his counterpart, and telling them how important it is. That would be what I would do if I was in his position.</p>
<p>It didn't take me two days or two weeks or three weeks to do a resolution about it. I wrote on the day that it happened to the federal minister to express my concerns and talk to people in Ottawa who have the ability to talk to those people. That is what the resolution asked me to do but I was ahead of the resolution because, Madam Speaker, I do care about what happens to the Fortress of Louisbourg. I do care about what happens to the people who are working there and I do care what happens to all of Nova Scotia when we have no vision or strategy from the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism.</p>
<p>When you ask the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, during debate, during Budget Estimates, what's your strategy for Cape Breton - well we have the Doers' and Dreamer' Guide, oh yeah, we do, we have the Doers' and Dreamers' Guide. When I ask him what his plan is, a simple thing like when you get on to the island of Cape Breton a sign that would say, welcome to the number one island in North America, where could you get that kind of advertising for nothing? But we don't have that advertising yet.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that if the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism won't do it that the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal would put it right across the top of the bridge at the causeway, welcome to the number one island in North America, because that's where we should be. Instead of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to PR firms we should be doing, and utilizing, the things that we have free. The number one island, the number one historic site in Canada - those are things that we should be building on, not taking for granted. Those are things that we need to move forward with.</p>
<p>Although there are other things that are important that we should be debating in this House, the very fact that the member for Lunenburg believed that this was important and it gave us an importunity to talk about such an important icon in our economy, and in our historic background, I thank her for that. I give her full marks for bringing it forward.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I have to say there is so much more we should be talking about in this House. We should be talking about all the other things that could create employment on the island of Cape Breton and other parts of Nova Scotia. But most of all we should be taking advantage of the things that are given to us, easily handed to us, like the number one island, like the number one North American historic site. Those are the kinds of things we should be doing.</p>
<p>We should also be talking about the other issues that this government doesn't seem to have the stomach, or the fortitude, to speak to - real business that has been affecting the Province of Nova Scotia. The Fortress of Louisbourg and what's taken place there is real business and those people are concerned, and we've been talking with them. But there are other issues that we need to move on. We need this government to take action and speak to the federal government as we will as a caucus, and as, I'm sure, others will in their particular caucus.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'm going to take my place now. I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak here and I would move that we adjourn debate.</p></speech>

            <p>Madam Speaker, I really didn't intend to speak on this but what really got me upset was my good friend, the member for Cape Breton West. I lived in that constituency, I know him well, I like him a lot but I can't believe that he is an apologist for the Harper Government, I just can't believe it.

<p>I used to think there were some Conservatives who were progressive. I don't think there is anything such as a Progressive Conservative any more. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, let me talk about Louisbourg. I just wish the Opposition Parties would allow me to talk about a community that is very close to my heart. I still own property there in Louisbourg and I was the president of the District One Tourism Association which covered an area from Main-&#xE0;-Dieu to Gabarus. Now the member for Cape Breton West knows the geography there and when I got involved with that association, there were seven tourist operators involved with it; we got the number up to 40 We had 40 tourist operators involved there.</p>
<p>You know the Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals have this ability to throw out percentages without any foundation whatsoever - 40 per cent. We heard that 40 per cent of those going to the Fortress of Louisbourg had come over on (Interruptions) My understanding was that about 40 per cent came on the ferry. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Well, Madam Speaker, I'll look at Hansard when it comes out. However, my wife, Mary Kay and I, had 500 guests a year in a bed and breakfast on Main Street, Louisbourg. I was involved in working with fish plants and other things up there. However, we operated that bed and breakfast for five years with about 500 guests a year, so I think I know the destination of the people who came to visit the fortress. We had a great cross-section (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, you know we're dealing with cuts at Fortress of Louisbourg but this isn't the first time the Conservatives have done damage to that community because I remember the cuts that took place in the past, under a couple of different governments when the times were cut down, when the times were reduced, and there was a tremendous impact on the business that we operated and the other businesses in the area. Every time you took an hour off the timeframe for the operation of that fortress, there was a detrimental effect because people would actually drive through town as the hours got more limited in the evenings.</p>
<p>That happened a number of times and I don't remember any of the Progressive Conservatives or Liberals standing up for those cuts either. They were cuts that had a major impact on that community.</p>

MACKINNON</from><p>The member for Cape Breton West was saying he'd love to have me back but I might have to go there to visit him after the next election. (Interruptions) Madam Speaker, I don't know why I have them wound up here. I'm just speaking a couple of words from the heart.</p>
<p>One of the things that Fortress of Louisbourg should have done and never did - and there are great people who work at the fortress in management and also all of the staff, I know and respect all of them. I know most of the ones who work at the fortress; I've been there many times, even went last year. However, what we have to do with Fortress of Louisbourg is not blame the provincial minister. There have to be fundamental changes within the fortress and its involvement with the community. The community was consulted a number of years ago. There was a deep consultation process and I remember being involved in that process and attending a lot of meetings. There was the feeling that there would be the involvement of the community.</p>
<p>I suggested things like having some of those dressed in period costume being piped through the main street at various times, once a day perhaps - things like that where the fortress actually came out into the community, where there were some people from the fortress actually into the community. There was never, ever an approach that got the community involved. There has to be a tying in and that tying in has to take place within the community. It can't be people in Ottawa dictating to the fortress folks how things are going to unfold. When we become apologists for the Harper Government, it is most annoying.</p>
<p>I believe we have to get the community involved, that we have to really stand up to Ottawa and that has to be more than one letter being written; it has to be a real involvement from the community. We, on this side of the House, are very concerned and Madam Speaker, we will now adjourn debate on this issue. (Interruption) I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak for a couple of moments on something very dear to my heart. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Richmond.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on Resolution No. 752. Allow me to say that while we're all concerned about trying to find new employment opportunities for Louisbourg and all of Cape Breton, may I suggest we may want a make-work project to build a statue or a monument to the member for Pictou East. Because for anyone to stand in this House and to self-proclaim that they've done more than anyone else, I think is a bit disingenuous to say the least. When people talk about playing politics, I don't think there's a better example of that than what we just heard from the member for Pictou East.</p>
<p>What's ironic is that when you listen to how he's saying writing a letter is not enough or standing in the House is not enough, I'm wondering what his Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is thinking while he's saying that because while he stands in the House and talks about the owner/operator policy, the cuts to EI and his concerns, when we said let's have an all-Party delegation go to Ottawa and deliver the message in person, we're still waiting for the phone call from that minister.</p>
<p>So may I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, that this government's bark is much worse than its bite because they seem to be more than happy to be in their little, safe place here in the Legislature to throw shots out and say how concerned they are but when it comes to taking real action, we see something completely different from this government. Let me give you an example. I know they've mentioned the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism and allow me to help him out as well because when you're talking about how the cuts affect the museum and the fortress over in Louisbourg, maybe the member for Pictou East and the member for Lunenburg also want to talk to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism to see what devastating impact that this government's cuts to the Student Employment Program is having on community museums throughout this province.</p>
<p>When we left office, and I know the Minister of Finance likes for us to give him numbers, so let me give him a number. When our government left office in 1999, in Richmond County there were 48 student employment positions just from the province in my riding. This year under this NDP Government there are 11 - so 48 to 11. We have museums that are now wondering whether they'll even be able to open their doors because of the fact that this government has made so many reductions to the Student Employment Program. So if this government is truly sincere about their concerns for Louisbourg and concerns for museums in this province, then maybe they should have a discussion with their Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism because I can tell you that that is certainly having a major impact on my riding and the many important community museums that we have.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, allow me to say that it is disappointing when the member for Pictou East self-proclaimed himself as the saviour of Louisbourg and has done more than anyone else, more than the French or the British troops, or anyone else. We'll have to add him into our history books in our schools, if we still have schools after the cuts made by this government, but we'll certainly have to look to amend that. The fact that he would stand in this House and chastise the member for Cape Breton West after he gave the numbers, because I have to say when the cuts were made, when this government eliminated the Yarmouth ferry, if someone had told me it was going to have such an impact on Cape Breton Island, I wouldn't have believed it. It's only once a study was made and that the tourism industry on Cape Breton Island told us, by the way, 40 per cent of all bus traffic to Cape Breton Island came via that Yarmouth ferry. So I can tell you, I'm not from Pictou, I'm from Cape Breton and I knew that statistic. (Applause)</p>
<p>Obviously, this government, when they made their decision to cut the Yarmouth ferry, wasn't thinking about Cape Breton. It certainly wasn't thinking about Yarmouth and it wasn't thinking about eastern Nova Scotia where his riding is as well, considering this bus traffic.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there is no question that Fortress of Louisbourg is an icon for Cape Breton. It's an icon for our province, an icon for our country, and I can say that it has certainly a significant value to the history of my own family because the Samson brothers, there were actually two brothers who came from Normandy, sailed over and went to Quebec. One of the brothers stayed in Quebec but the other brother, Gabriel, came to Louisbourg and fished out of Louisbourg for a number of years before making his way over to Petit-de-Grat and Isle Madame in Richmond County. From there the Samson family grew. Now, I'm not sure if Gabriel Samson back then would have been aware of the contributions of the member for Pictou East to the community of Louisbourg but we'll see if we can't amend some of our family history to put a little note in there as well to make sure he does get some recognition for that. Maybe we owe our own family history to the member for Pictou East. So we'll have to look at that as well.</p>
<p>As was mentioned by the member for Cape Breton West, the fortress has been a major employer throughout Cape Breton Island and many of my constituents over the years have been employed there. In fact, a number of them still are full-time employees over at the fortress. Many of the employees at Louisbourg come from the communities of Richmond County and especially from Ch&#xE9;ticamp, because of their ability to speak French, so they continue to be a major employer. In fact, I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that my sister worked there for a number of summers while attending university, because of the fact that she was able to give tours in both languages - in English and in French - and certainly Louisbourg was very close to us.</p>
<p>As was mentioned by the member for Cape Breton West, I know many of the youth in my area go through their summer program as animators there, especially from &#xC9;cole Beau-Port in Arichat, which is the Acadian school, because of the fact that they speak French. They go there for the summer. Their parents usually end up bringing a camper, and they take up accommodations. So we're all being part of the economic development that takes place there and the benefits that come from that.</p>
<p>As well, one would note - and I'm sure the member for Cape Breton West knows - that a significant sector of the tourists who do come to Louisbourg are from Quebec, because the people of Quebec have such a rich history and such a knowledge of their history. It's not uncommon to see many licence plates from Quebec making their way down to Louisbourg to appreciate the history that's there and to know that many of their own families' first arrival to North America would have been via the Fortress of Louisbourg. Again, one has to question how much is being done by our province to market the Fortress of Louisbourg over in the Province of Quebec, which continues to send so many tourists here to the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not join my colleague from Cape Breton West and my colleague from Cape Breton South in saying that for us to be here tonight - the government having called the hours from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. - talking about a resolution when you have 28 bills introduced by the Official Opposition - I haven't counted how many, but I know there are at least a couple of dozen coming from the Progressive Conservative caucus as well. The question is, for those who are watching tonight, has the government run out of business? Well, they have.</p>
<p>Is there a reason why the government is not calling Opposition business? Well, I would submit to you, Madam Speaker, that if anyone needs an example of the arrogance of a majority NDP Government, tonight is it. It's bad enough that they really have no business to talk about, but when they did, the member for Pictou East wanted to adjourn the business and prevent any further discussion on this.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Madam Speaker, I did have the opportunity to say a few words, and I have to say that Nova Scotians right now are looking to us for leadership. They are looking for someone to stand up to talk about the devastating impacts cuts to education are having throughout our province, in our classrooms. They are looking for leadership on who is going to stand up to the millionaires over at Nova Scotia Power and say that enough is enough, we expect fair rates in this province. They are looking for leadership to explain, why does Nova Scotia have the highest taxes in the entire country, with the HST having been increased by this government to 15 per cent? Those are some of the issues that Nova Scotians are looking for leadership for.</p>
<p>Is there business that could be called, dealing with those matters? We have 28 pieces of legislation that affect the lives of Nova Scotians, that they would have hoped that a responsible government, even under its majority, would have at least allowed us to have debate on. Madam Speaker, no Party and no government has a monopoly on good ideas, and Nova Scotians expect this Chamber to be the place where we can exchange those ideas. We may not always agree, but we should at least be able to put our ideas forward, to debate them, and to have a vote on them.</p>
<p>We have tried to do that. On our Opposition Days we have continually brought forward legislation only to watch government members talk it out and not even allow it to come to a vote. Madam Speaker, that's not the way democracy should work. I would question many of those elected for the first time in 2009, if this really is what they expected from a majority NDP Government, to basically tell the Opposition, you're irrelevant, as far as we're concerned - even though we represent almost half of this House - to be told your ideas are not going forward. Nova Scotians are not going to have the opportunity to hear a debate on them. They're not going to have the opportunity to see the House vote on them. That's certainly not why I believe many of them put their names on the ballot but that is the reality that we have under this majority government.</p>
<p>Tonight it looks like debate may be coming to a close even though we have all sorts of legislation that we could be talking about and that we could be putting forward as solutions and ideas to deal with the problems facing Nova Scotians. That opportunity rests in the hands of the Government House Leader because under the British Parliamentary system, other than on our Opposition Days, we cannot call our legislation; we cannot demand that it be brought to a vote. We are powerless when it comes to that. It is strictly in the hands of the Government House Leader to determine whether any Opposition business will be considered or will be brought to a vote.</p>
<p>This session seems to be coming near the end. It saddens me that in this session not one piece of Opposition business has made it past second reading even though you have over 30 bills, almost 40 bills, presented by the Opposition. If that is not an example of the arrogance of this government, I cannot think of a better one. Nova Scotians are not better off for that; they are poorer for that and Nova Scotians are seeing now that what the NDP asked for in Opposition and what they are delivering under government, are two vastly different things and I would submit to you our province is not better off because of that. Merci.</p></speech>

<p>I think the member for Richmond had a lot of the issues completely correct and why we're here again this evening. It's 6:15 p.m. so we're two hours into this session today. What we've seen over the last number of weeks, we've seen the longest days we've done as being the Opposition Days where they are a set time of four hours. I think that's a shame.</p>
<p>The member for Richmond was also very correct when it came to working with Opposition, finding the good ideas that are held within the bills that are held on this list that could be good ideas. At this point even if the government would steal the idea and put it in their own bill, it would be a far better way than we've been over the last couple of sessions in accepting or working with the Opposition in order to help out the different areas of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Again, this resolution today is one that concerns us, one that we've done our work in dealing with the federal government. You heard the member for Cape Breton West talk about what was important for his community and how he can work with those individuals to make sure that Cape Breton, Cape Breton West, Louisbourg, and all those areas, will remain strong. When we have a strong Cape Breton we have a strong Nova Scotia. It's important for my constituents in Argyle and in southwestern Nova Scotia, just like they are in reverse.</p>
<p>Never in my time here at the House of Assembly - I know some of you are of my vintage of nine years and I'm sure that you can't pick a day that we were discussing resolutions on a government business day. I would love to ask someone to go back and look at it but I know that would be a bit of a waste of time for us.</p>
<p>What's going to happen next, as I finish up? What is going to happen next is that the Deputy Government House Leader will stand and he'll probably end up calling Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.</p></speech>
