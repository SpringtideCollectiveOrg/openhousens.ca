        <speech by="#bill.estabrooks"><from>HON. WILLIAM ESTABROOKS</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I beg leave to table the Surplus Crown Property Disposal Report, but before I do that, I want to compliment MLAs on all sides of the House for directing community groups throughout their constituencies to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. I'd also point out that there are some excellent buys there for second-hand furniture, second-hand air conditioners - you should use them in your office.</p>
<p>With those few comments, Mr. Speaker, I table the Surplus Crown Property Disposal Report for the period April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2011.</p></speech>

          <p>Yesterday during debate in Question Period - a fairly raucous one, I think you would agree - I made some comments which were unparliamentary. I wish to retract those comments, Mr. Speaker, and I also wish to apologize to you and to all members of this House, particularly to any member who feels that the comments that I made were directed at them. (Applause)</p>

          <p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our caucus I certainly commend the member for Lunenburg West. Sometimes in the heat of debate, we've all been caught - myself included, I have to add, on possibly a few occasions by yourself and your predecessors in that Chair. I certainly commend the member for Lunenburg West and look forward to continued debate.</p>
