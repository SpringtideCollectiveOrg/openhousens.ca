<p>I would like to begin by thanking His Honour for the words of his first Speech from the Throne. You have delivered a superb speech, and I know the people of Nova Scotia would be proud of the work you do across our province in representing Her Majesty The Queen.

      </speech>
      <speech by="#5ea124ec-7407-44b5-a8f7-f62183d1968f"><from>MR. PREST</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this Speech from the Throne talks about turning a corner - from decline to progress; from the old ways to the new ways. It talks about change in direction and moving towards a better future for all Nova Scotia families. The Speech builds on what government has been committed to, and focused on, since we formed government in 2009. We wouldn't have been able to turn the corner without the support of many Nova Scotians, so when we reflect on leadership and the progress that we have made, it is a reflection of what the citizens have asked us for and told us they need. We are leading Nova Scotians towards a brighter future, and it's just around the corner.</p>
<p>I want to speak about leadership, not just here in the House of Assembly but in all parts of our life. I believe it takes more than just guiding or directing a group to demonstrate leadership.</p>
<p>Leadership is more than just being a spokesperson. Leadership involves making tough decisions, having big ambitions, and accepting challenges gracefully. These traits of leadership are evident here today in this House of Assembly. Over the past four years, our government has demonstrated genuine leadership as we have faced many tough decisions, and we have been working to ensure we make the right choices for today's families. That is why, when we were elected, we made the decision to invest in families, jobs, skills training, schools, hospitals, care for seniors, and our natural resources. The decision to enter into an agreement to acquire hydroelectricity from the Muskrat Falls project was one of the most historic decisions in this province. The leadership that was demonstrated by so many of my colleagues on this project really shows Nova Scotians just how committed to the future of our province I am, and how committed our government is.</p>
<p>All Nova Scotians have ambitions, Mr. Speaker. We are born with them, and all across our province we see each and every day - we have for generations. I have many ambitions. Some of them are personal, like growing older with my wife, Nancy, and spending time with my children and grandchildren and teaching them about forestry practices in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I also have ambitions that are professional. I got involved in politics because I wanted to make Nova Scotia an even better place to live, work, and play. I want to help ensure that our seniors have access to the care they need and the resources they want, and that they have the opportunity to live in their communities for as long as they can. That is why our government is helping provide funding for seniors' homes, positive aging, safety grants, and better health care sooner.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know that seniors and all people on the Eastern Shore are delighted that we now have access to better health care sooner. With our hospital in Musquodoboit Harbour adopting the Collaborative Emergency Centre model, it means that we have access to primary health care right here in our community.</p>
<p>I also have ambitions for our young people in this province. They are just starting their own list of ambitions: buying houses, beginning careers, and perhaps having a family. We are creating a Nova Scotia that is promising for these young people. We are offering relief to first-time home buyers through the first-time home buyers tax credit, and we are investing in jobs and the economy to ensure that the good jobs they want and deserve are right here at home. We have created additional child care spaces all over Nova Scotia, ensuring that, as their young families grow, there is care for their children as well.</p>
<p>When we were elected, we laid out our ambitions in seven key commitments. I am very happy to say that we have followed through on those commitments, and we will continue to stay the course toward an even better Nova Scotia for the future.</p>
<p>In demonstrating genuine leadership, we have accepted challenges. We took on aggressive goals to reduce our greenhouse gases, and moved toward a cleaner, greener, and more secure energy future. Making the transition from imported coal to a renewable energy source is a challenge, but this government is taking it on and demonstrating success. Just last week the first community renewable energy project came on-line, which is just one part of our plan to ensure the lowest, fairest power rates for families and businesses.</p>
<p>This government accepted the challenge to develop the first aquaculture strategy in Nova Scotia history. I think I will repeat that: the first aquaculture strategy in our history. For the first time ever in our province, we have a process in place, a system to follow, that is based on science. This process has brought many challenges of creating an environment in which the aquaculture industry could thrive and which would not compromise our precious resources.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as the honourable member knows, I am from the Eastern Shore. My family and the families around me have been passionate about our fisheries and oceans for decades. We play there, we work there, and we live there, and we want to ensure that we continue to do the same for many years to come.</p>
<p>I ask all members in the House of Assembly to pay close attention to my message for the future of this province. If we take a walk inland, away from our beautiful coast, we are embraced by another very precious resource that is historic to the Eastern Shore and our entire province - our forestry industry. Now, you all know I could easily talk for the rest of the day about my life growing up in this industry, my love for the unique species of trees, and my countless experiences working in our forests, but I won't do that.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about is another enormous challenge our government accepted. We took on the challenge of reviewing how our forests are managed, how they are harvested, and how they help promote the industry. My father worked in this industry, and I can only hope that someday my grandchildren will continue our family tradition, to try their hands in the forestry sector.</p>
<p>My father worked in this industry, building his first water-powered mill in 1939. He raised and supported 10 children, of whom nine were directly involved in the forestry, including myself, the youngest. From there, 27 of his grandchildren were raised and supported from this industry. At the present time, five of my seven grandchildren are raised and supported by the forestry industry. If anybody wonders why I feel so much passion for the forestry industry, I would like to sit down sometime with each and every one of you and explain it. It runs deep.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Prest family's roots in the forest industry are here for generations to come, and not even hurricanes like Juan will discourage us. Some of the most rewarding experience is what nature offers us, which no monetary value could replace.</p>
<p>When we travel our beautiful province and we see the forests that nature has provided protecting our wildlife, water quality, air quality, and wetlands, the fibre in these trees seems to be what is the most sought-after asset. If I could give an economic example of the value of the watershed and wetland protection, I would refer to a case in New York City. Back in the 1990s, when trying to address a drinking water supply concern for the city, it was decided to protect the wetlands that supply the reservoirs by various means, rather than construct a new treatment facility. The cost associated with this decision was a $1.5 billion investment for the protection, versus $6 billion to $8 billion for construction of a treatment facility, plus an additional $300 to $500 million in annual operating costs. The plan was implemented, and was successful in the short term. I have not seen any long-term reports; however, I expect that it continued to be a success, as I believe in New York City they are still drinking water - saving taxpayer dollars in the end, and all the other benefits that nature provides for free.</p>
<p>In order for our grandchildren to have the chance to work, live, and play in a beautiful Nova Scotian forest, things had to change. We have introduced modernized legislation, and we are developing regulations to ensure that our forests will exist, through balanced and sustainable management practices. But we can't stop there. We must continue to ensure these practices are being strictly enforced throughout our province. We must continue to work together to find solutions and opportunities that balance the economic, environmental, and social impacts of resource development and conservation.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to say what an honour it has been for me to represent the great people of the Eastern Shore. As an elected member I have had many opportunities to work hard for the people who elected me and to demonstrate leadership on the issues that matter the most to them. I will continue to work hard and do my best and hear their questions, and I will ensure their voices are heard by our government.</p>
<p>It's also been an honour for me to stand in this House and speak as a member of this government. It is with confidence in our government and our proven ability to show genuine leadership that I move that this Speech from the Throne, as read by His Honour, Brigadier-General The Honourable J. J. Grant, be accepted as read. Thank you.</p></speech>

        <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
        <p>The honourable member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#358dbc8a-a052-4a0f-96df-1adea9a5bbdd"><from>MR. MAT WHYNOTT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is certainly an honour again to rise in my place to speak on the Speech from the Throne that was read today by His Honour, Brigadier-General The Honourable J. J. Grant, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. I move to second the Speech from the Throne.</p>
<p>First of all, one of the things that I want to recognize in the Speech from the Throne is the individuals who were mentioned who have passed away - prominent Nova Scotians who have passed away over this past year - recognizing them and their contributions to our province, and building our province the way it is today because of those people - not only the people who were recognized in the Speech from the Throne, but those people who have built our communities right from Yarmouth to Sydney, and every community in between. Those people have really built the foundation of what our communities are today, so I want to recognize those people as well, because they have played such an important role in building our province as we know it today.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know that earlier there were some HRM councillors who were here in the gallery. In particular, one who I did want to recognize is Matt Whitman, who is the councillor for Hammonds Plains - newly elected after the election in the Fall. He was elected in the 2012 Fall election for the municipal council. Working with him has been an honour so far, and whenever the next election may be, I look forward to working with him into the future.</p>
<p>I want to talk a little bit about the reason why I got involved in politics. I'm not necessarily one of the more, let's say, mature members of the House as far as age goes, and so I want to take a step back and the reason why I got involved in our Party, in the NDP, and why I am a New Democrat.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I remember I was one of these kids in school, between P to 12, who was - I would consider myself a political geek. I would be one of these kids who would sit back on election night, watch elections on CBC or CTV - any election that was taking place across the country - and watch it with much interest. And I always said that I would love to one day put my name on a ballot to hopefully be elected and represent the community in which I live.</p>
<p>And so I remember the very first time I decided to get involved in Party politics was in the 2003 election campaign. I was 15 at the time and I remember - I lived in the constituency of Sackville-Cobequid - and this was during the election when a good friend and good New Democrat, John Holm, had decided not to re-offer. And, Mr. Speaker, I remember going into campaign headquarters to meet the candidate of that time - he's the member for Sackville-Cobequid currently, and the Minister of Health and Wellness - and I remember walking into the campaign and asking to sign up to be a member of the NDP. And we all know that oftentimes there aren't necessarily a lot of people who come in to sign up to be members of our Party. There aren't droves and droves of people - you have to pay a membership and say hey, you know what (Interruption) Anyway, I digress.</p>
<p>So I go into the campaign headquarters saying I want to sign up to be a member of the NDP. And I remember thinking, I remember hearing what the candidate of the time, the Minister of Health and Wellness saying we thought you were a spy, we thought you might be a spy to come in and look into what we were doing in our campaign.</p>
<p>And so, that was my very first experience with politics, Mr. Speaker. But being able to get involved with the Young New Democrats, but also being involved in my community and my local church, in the various School Advisory Councils in my community, being involved in the various community centre groups, the various community groups as well, really being involved in those different organizations and groups, doing what you do in your community really builds on how we, as MLAs, do our work. And so, during that campaign, I remember getting out and talking to people about why they voted NDP, and quite frankly, why Sackville has been a prominent NDP seat for the New Democratic Party since the early days, in the early 1980s - in fact, even before I was born, that seat has been NDP.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, that was my first taste of politics, and so after that election I certainly got involved with the Young New Democrats, and getting involved in our Party, going to NDP conventions, and I remember in 2005 I was doing some work at our caucus office as a staff member, and I remember at the time, in 2006, someone asked me: Mat, why don't you put your name on a ballot? And at that time, in 2006, I was 20 years old. I said I can't do that. I'm not mature enough; I don't have the credentials. I don't have, you know, those sorts of things.</p>
<p>So I decided, Mr. Speaker, I would talk to the people in my community. Those are the people I worked with for a number of years, those are the people who know who I am, those are the people who would come out and support me. And so, I was asking these people and I was getting an overwhelming response from those folks to put my name forward. And after speaking to our Leader, he said, yes, let's do this.</p>
<p>One of the interesting parts before that 2006 election campaign was that we had three people on our membership list. There wasn't a lot of organization, and unfortunately, Mary Shultz, one of those people who was involved in my executive, passed away in this past year and a half. Mary Shultz was an amazing woman. She was always the first person you saw when you opened the doors of a campaign office, but unfortunately, she did pass away from cancer.</p>
<p>The 2006 election campaign was an amazing experience. It really was. For someone at the age of 20 to come so close to defeating a Cabinet Minister, it was quite an honour, and I think to have lost - many people in this Chamber have put their names on ballots a few times and have lost, but have continued to ensure that their voice is heard. They have continued to want to do the work of their community by putting their name on a ballot. I don't care what Party you're from - we all do this for a reason. The reason I am with this Party is because I have always believed that. I remember a time when my mom, who was a single mom, who adopted me at 28 days old, a single mom who was a nurse - a CNA, they were called at the time - a CNA who was on strike.</p>
<p>I remember walking the picket line with my mom, and I remember thinking to myself, as a young man, a young Nova Scotian, that this wasn't right. I remember the people who were there with the workers who were on strike were New Democrats. They were there talking with them. They were there listening to their concerns, sitting down and having a conversation about what it meant to be on strike and what it meant to treat people properly in the workplace. I'll never forget that moment when I was out there walking the picket line with my mom.</p>
<p>We take a lot from what our parents teach us. One of the things my mom has always taught me is that if you work hard and you let people know what you think, you will be able to do good in this world. Who knew that a young guy from Sackville, the son of a CNA - an LPN - the son of a single mom raising three kids, would be sitting here in this historic Chamber? I want to say a huge thank you to my family, and to my mom in particular, for doing all the things that she did for me, growing up here in Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>
<p>I didn't have the opportunity of sitting in Opposition - I know many of my colleagues on this side of the House have. I didn't have the opportunity to sit on the Opposition side, but I have had the opportunity to sit over here, and we know that for the past almost four years now, decisions haven't been easy. We know that. In this Speech, we talk about moving Nova Scotia forward and ensuring that we do have change for the better.</p>
<p>So the things that were taught to me as a young Nova Scotian by my parents, by my mom - those things I now want to instill in my 19-month-old daughter, and one on the way. We want to be able to instill those values. I want to be able to instill those values and build a future that will ensure that Nova Scotia is preserved, that Nova Scotia has policies and initiatives in place that will sustain our province. In the past we didn't have that. We didn't have a vision for health care - things where we had those chronic problems with ER closures. We've come up with solutions. We didn't have a vision for agriculture, we didn't have that. We have that now. We've worked with different sectors across government departments; we've worked with sectors in various community organizations. We've consulted with Nova Scotians in every policy decision we've moved forward with, we've talked with Nova Scotians. That has never happened in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm very hopeful, as a Nova Scotian, that our government has - we are building a better foundation so that our future starts here, our future to ensure that we no longer have young people having to leave our province. Why has that, in the past, been the norm? We should never have let that happen but Parties did. Let's move forward, let's ensure that we don't have that happening, so that families can build a life here in this province, so that we can have the jobs of today. Having high-tech companies come to Nova Scotia is a good thing, building an economy of the future, having a commission on the economy of Nova Scotia, listening to Nova Scotians and hearing what they're saying, that's a good thing.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to mention, Mr. Speaker, and I have had the ability over the last couple of weeks - several weeks, in fact - to go around the province with the Minister of Energy and talk about the real concern that I heard from Nova Scotians in my constituency and right across the province about the need for a plan for lower, fairer power rates.</p>
<p>In the past we had this issue where we were shackled to the international fossil fuel market pricing and we just sat back and let that happen, Mr. Speaker. So now we are undertaking a very historic opportunity that will ensure we have 35 years of stable energy rates for Nova Scotians. This has been an issue for many, many years. In fact in the 1970s I note there was one year where electricity prices went up by 47.2 per cent. The Premier of the day said, well, at least it wasn't as much as the utility asked for. That's what the history books tell us.</p>
<p>What we know is that we couldn't continue on that path. So the Muskrat Falls initiative, the Maritime Link initiative, will ensure that Nova Scotians have stable electricity rates for their homes, for their businesses and for community centres right across our province. It's a milestone, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>With the help of everyday Nova Scotians, we have developed the first of its kind in the world, a Community Feed-In Tariff program, Mr. Speaker, something that benefits communities right across our province. This plan will ensure that we develop local, green, tax-free and reliable power. It's a hallmark of our energy plan.</p>
<p>We've got to get off coal, Mr. Speaker; we have to, for our future. So we are doing that. We are the first in North America to place firm, hard caps on greenhouse gas emissions from power generation. That is showing that Nova Scotia is a leader. In fact, we were recognized in Copenhagen for that. Our province, our little Province of Nova Scotia, was recognized for that at an international forum on greenhouse gas emissions. We should be celebrating that. We need to take that environment of responsibility, that's what this government is doing.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, these are the sorts of things that were outlined in the Speech from the Throne. These are the sorts of things that Nova Scotians voted for in 2009. These are the sorts of things that I believe, as a New Democrat, as someone who sits in this House - we believe will move Nova Scotia forward. I look forward to working with each and every person in this House and people in my communities, the different communities that I have the pleasure of representing, over the coming weeks, months, and years ahead.</p>
<p>I thank you for that opportunity, Mr. Speaker, and I will take my seat.</p></speech>

      <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise and say a few remarks today about the Speech from the Throne. First of all I want to acknowledge the Lieutenant Governor for the work that he is doing on behalf of the Province of Nova Scotia, and congratulate him on his appointment. I also want to extend my congratulations to Mrs. Grant who I often see in communities across this province as the Lieutenant Governor is going about doing his duties, and I thank both of them on behalf of the people of the Province of Nova Scotia.

      <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Well, he just tells me she's from Bridgetown, all the better. (Laughter) But I do want to congratulate him and I want to congratulate his mother on doing what is a very difficult job sometimes and that is raising children, and she obviously did a great job that you arrived in the House of Assembly so pass on our congratulations. (Applause)</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the member for Eastern Shore who all of us in this House have had the opportunity to be pigeonholed in some corner of this building, to talk about forestry. His passion was evident today and you can understand why. It has been passed down from his family, from him, and he feels that it's his responsibility to not only pass it on to his children and grandchildren, but to ensure that all of our children and grandchildren get an opportunity to experience that great natural resource that we have here called our forest industry. We look forward to him continuing to educate us on how we can ensure that that's there. To the member, congratulations, and keep up the good work. (Applause)</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge the members that were in the gallery, family and friends. I particularly want to acknowledge the brother of the Minister of Agriculture; for a minute there I thought the Minister of Agriculture was sitting in the gallery. I was going to say that maybe the good twin should come down on the floor but that wouldn't be fair, Mr. Speaker. (Laughter)</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge that while the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture and I may not always agree on public policy, I have always appreciated the kind gesture he has always extended to my family when they have arrived here in Province House, as many members do to family members. I do want to thank all of the family members in the gallery who have made a commitment to public life because a loved one has signed and put their name on a ballot. There may only be one name on that ballot but the entire family gets the joy of running in an election campaign.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my own daughter, Colleen, who is here. As many of you know Colleen is no stranger to this House, she gets an opportunity to follow me around, come down from Saint Mary's where she will graduate from this Spring, and representing her brother who had graduated from Marconi Campus last year and is one of those Nova Scotians who is working in western Canada, and obviously representing her mother and she does that so well. Colleen, congratulations, and thanks for being here. (Applause)</p>
<p>I, too, would like to remind this House of a few names that were in the Speech from the Throne. Daurene Lewis, who we lost this year - Daurene was the mayor of Annapolis Royal. She was not only a tremendous community builder and educator, but a great inspiration and friend to so many. It is a deep loss for our community, but also for the entire province. As mentioned about the Lieutenant Governor, the Honourable James Kinley, I had the privilege of being with some navy reservists in the last few weeks, and one of them was his grandson. We know how proud Mr. Kinley was of Lunenburg, the foundry, the Bluenose, and his love of the sea, so he would be extremely proud to know that his grandson is there continuing the family tradition.</p>
<p>Pat Connolly - all of us know him as the voice of the Mooseheads, but I can tell you that as a young kid from the Annapolis Valley, with a number of my siblings who were ushers at the old forum, I had the privilege of attending a game. All of a sudden, out came this booming voice, and "here come the Vees," and Connolly would bring it in. I remember that, and even had a chance since then, prior to his passing, to get a chance to meet him. What a true gentleman he was, and a great lover of sports.</p>
<p>Ruth Goldbloom - obviously without Ruth, Pier 21 wouldn't exist as it is today. What she lost in height she sure made up for in spunk, and was a great inspiration to all of us. She loved Cape Breton Island and she loved this province. She committed her entire work to ensuring that we remembered the families that immigrated to this country and remembered those who built it. I want to recognize Ruth today.</p>
<p>Obviously with the communities of Woods Harbour and Cape Sable Island, we all mourn the loss of five young Nova Scotians in more recent time. That community's loss was our province's loss. It's one that no community will ever get over, but hopefully, one that a community will be able to come together and move beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the Speech from the Throne there were some other Nova Scotians who were recognized, but each of us in the communities that we represent over the last year have lost either community members or family members who may not have had the public profile of the people who I've mentioned, but who certainly made a lasting impression on our lives and on our communities and made Nova Scotia a better place to live.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to make a few comments about the Speech from the Throne, if I may. This government looks fondly back over the last four years. I can tell you that Nova Scotians do not. This has been a long four years for the people of Nova Scotia: the HST has increased by 2 per cent, and 1,400 user fees have gone up. Mark my words, those user fees will go up again under this NDP Government. Those fees are a tax by any other name.</p>
<p>As we all know, members of the government, when they were on this side of the House, used to remind us that those fees were supposed to be a cost recovery, but since going into power, they see them as a revenue generator. A tax is a tax is a tax.</p>
<p>More and more Nova Scotians are losing their jobs. Full-time jobs are disappearing with the prospect of only part-time work, and 6,400 fewer Nova Scotians are working than last year alone. Fewer Nova Scotians are working today than during the height of the recession in 2008, yet this government claims we are turning a corner. More and more Nova Scotians are leaving this province to find work elsewhere to support their families. Businesses and entrepreneurs are forced to lay off their friends and neighbours. They are forced to close their doors after a lifetime of building a business, building a reputation, and building communities. They are watching their tax dollars being handed over to other businesses - to their competition, using their very own tax dollars to compete against them.</p>
<p>Tourism operators across the province are trying to make up from the devastating loss of the Yarmouth ferry. We call it the Yarmouth ferry, but really it's Nova Scotia's ferry. The short-sighted decision by this government has repercussions from one end of this province to the other.</p>
<p>Those who pay the power bills are paying 30 per cent more today under this government than they were just four years ago. They are watching as their government defends Nova Scotia Power, its monopoly, and its guaranteed rate of return - guaranteeing profit at every turn. They are frustrated by a government that refuses to stand up for Nova Scotians, that refuses to get the people of this province out from under the thumb of Nova Scotia Power. They are confused by a government rushing ahead with a multi-billion dollar mega-project where Nova Scotians take all the risk and pay all the bills, and Emera collects all the profit. They can't even tell Nova Scotians how much that energy will cost, yet they go around talking about it's the best deal for them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, they're concerned by the fact that their government can't, or won't, tell them how much they're going to pay for Muskrat Falls and what it will mean to their power bills; worried that the government is doing everything in its power to force this project onto ratepayers and strengthen the grip of Nova Scotia Power on Nova Scotia ratepayers and their pocketbooks; and outraged at a government that sees Nova Scotia Power as the answer, when so very clearly they're the problem.</p>
<p>This government likes to talk about investing in children. The only thing this government has offered our children, Mr. Speaker, is cuts to the classroom. Teachers and students - the targets of $65 million dollars' worth of short-sighted cuts - left scrambling for resources that government has pulled out of the classroom across this province where 700 teachers lost their jobs, educational assistants, support staff, librarians and many others put out of work by this government's determination to gut public education, and students struggling to get by in a system in desperate need of leadership from the province, a system in desperate need of investment.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are 725 students waiting for speech-language pathologists - 650 of those are in elementary school; and there are 1,343 students waiting for school psychologists - 782 of those are in elementary school. Per-student funding is next to last in the country, and falling further behind under this government; classrooms across the province - elementary, middle, and high school - have more diverse needs than ever before in our province's history; and teachers and students struggling every day because this government refuses to properly fund the most important economic tool we have - our children in our public education system. (Applause)</p>
<p>Those waiting for health care in this province - hundreds of Nova Scotians waiting 10 years or more for ankle surgery, and what does this government do? It allows a specialist to leave our province. Knee replacements: 2,265 people waiting - over 1,200 of them have been waiting six months, and nearly 700 have been waiting more than a year; hip replacements: nearly 900 people waiting - over 400 over six months, and nearly 200 have been waiting over a year; cataract surgery: 4,061 waiting for surgery - over 1,300 waiting more than six months, and over 500 have been waiting more than a year. Mr. Speaker, well behind the national standards.</p>
<p>There are 31 communities across this province that need doctors; another 900 doctors are expected to retire in the next eight years. That's one-third of the doctors in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The CEC model, which this government loves to boast about - despite what government says, Mr. Speaker, emergency rooms across Nova Scotia were closed for 17,717 hours from April 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012. That's the equivalent of 738 days, and while this government won't admit it, the CEC model is just another way of saying your emergency room is closed.</p>
<p>We, in the Liberal caucus, are proud of the expanded scope paramedics are playing in our health care system. We are proud of the work they do. However, we should take heed to what is happening. Advanced care paramedics are leaving for Alberta - 22 in the last year alone. This leaves us devoid of experience and mentors to help newer paramedics learn and excel. This is a government that, after four long years in power, has failed to proclaim the Paramedics Act, Mr. Speaker, the same Party, in fact, that criticized the Tories for failing to proclaim that Act in their previous four years in government. And after all of this, all of these facts, this government has the audacity to spend taxpayers' money on TV ads trying to convince them that they're really getting "better care sooner."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, for four long years taxpayers have seen billions of their hard-earned tax dollars handed over to corporations at the drop of a hat, without so much as a job guarantee for Nova Scotians, without these massive corporations having to pay back the Premier's donations - a government that has grown the debt of this province by $1.4 billion in just four years. Let me repeat that: $1.4 billion in four long years.</p>
<p>Think about that. After 146 years of Confederation, we have a $13.7 billion debt and the NDP Government has created 10 per cent of our provincial debt in the last four years. That's $1.4 billion in just four years. There are 6,400 fewer people working this year than last; power bills are up 30 per cent; 1,400 user fees have increased, and we know they're on the verge of going up again; HST increased by 2 per cent. That's the true legacy of this government's corporate welfare agenda, Mr. Speaker, that's the true cost. I will elaborate more on these issues when I continue later in the week.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. Words cannot express how disappointed I am today in this announcement by government. All of us are all too aware of the tragedies that were suffered by children there, children that were supposed to be protected by this province, a duty this province and governments of all political stripes failed to uphold. Victims wanted a public inquiry, the community wanted a public inquiry and the people of this province have asked for a public inquiry. Yet this government has failed all of us and this government has failed to listen. A panel is this government taking the easy way out. It's this government failing the victims; it's this government denying justice to an entire generation of Nova Scotians.</p>
