MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to draw the attention of members of the House to the east gallery, where we are joined today by Bruce Saunders and Bruce Quigley. I'd ask them to stand. Mr. Saunders is the Chair of the Board for the Cumberland Health Authority and Mr. Quigley is the CEO of the Cumberland Health Authority.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as you know, this district health authority is leading the way with regard to the creation of Collaborative Emergency Centres in Nova Scotia, which was a recommendation of the Dr. John Ross report. The first CEC opened in Parrsboro last July.</p>
<p>This work is not easy work, and Mr. Saunders and Mr. Quigley and their team are leading in this province - indeed, beyond this province - in this new model of health care. They've worked tirelessly to open the CEC in Parrsboro, as well as two more CECs that have been announced in their district. So I would like to thank them for their innovation, their dedication, and their hard work, and extend that thanks to their team. I would ask members to extend a warm welcome to them.

        <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to rise in the House today and announce an important investment in our health care system. Today I'm proud to announce that, as part of Nova Scotia's new Jobs and Building Plan, the province is investing $6.8 million to fund infrastructure upgrades to hospitals so that Collaborative Emergency Centres can be established throughout Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>This investment will help provide Nova Scotians living in rural areas with access to same-day or next-day medical appointments and 24/7 emergency care. Over the past year, as part of the government's commitment in Better Care Sooner, I've travelled around our province talking with people about health care. Through these conversations, I've learned that nothing is more important to Nova Scotians than health care. Every one of us has had an experience with the health care system, and we never underestimate the importance and value it holds in our lives.</p>
<p>I've met with residents, community leaders, and health care providers in communities such as Springhill, Lunenburg, Tatamagouche, Pugwash, New Waterford, Musquodoboit Valley, Canso, and Annapolis Royal, and a number of things became clear to me through these conversations. The first is that, more than anything else, Nova Scotians want peace of mind with regard to our health care system. We want stability within our system and we want to know that help is available should we ever need it.</p>
<p>I've also heard that over time the needs of our communities have changed, and our health care system must evolve to meet these changes. This evolution is not always easy, and it has resulted in some challenges. Here in Nova Scotia, as Dr. John Ross has pointed out, we currently experience emergency department closures in rural areas and long wait times to see primary care doctors. Also, many people - particularly in rural communities - who go to emergency rooms do not require emergency care. In fact, over 90 per cent of visits to smaller emergency departments are problems that can be adequately treated in a primary health care setting.</p>
<p>To help address these challenges, our government has committed to the establishment of Collaborative Emergency Centres. A Collaborative Emergency Centre brings together emergency departments and local family practices, working as a team to provide health care to Nova Scotians. Specifically, a Collaborative Emergency Centre will provide access to primary care by a team of professionals, including doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners, for extended hours seven days per week.</p>
<p>I should also indicate that Collaborative Emergency Centres have same-day or next-day access to appointments, as needed, and 24/7 access to emergency care. In many cases this will enable symptoms to be caught early, which may prevent emergencies or a health crisis from developing. Nighttime care will be provided by a team which may include nurses and paramedics. These health care providers will work with the oversight of specially-trained emergency room physicians.</p>
<p>Here in Nova Scotia, we have announced five CECs since last Spring. Mr. Speaker, as you know, our province's first CEC is located in Parrsboro, and this CEC has experienced great success. It has been up and running since July, and it has seen many patients. In fact, I'm told that patients from outside the area are coming to that CEC. They find it a popular model, and hopefully when we get the other CECs in the area operating, they will be able to migrate back to their home community.</p>
<p>Feedback from residents of Parrsboro is quite positive. It indicates that residents of this community have embraced the CEC concept. They consider the CEC to be a better and more efficient use of our health care dollars.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned, the success of the Parrsboro CEC is due to the hard work, innovative thinking and dedication of Mr. Quigley, Mr. Saunders and the team at the Cumberland Health Authority. I want to again acknowledge them and their hard work.</p>
<p>We have also announced CECs for the communities of Pugwash, Springhill in the Cumberland Health Authority, as well as Tatamagouche and Annapolis Royal. I have every confidence that we will see a number of these new CECs opening early in the new year. CECs will make a huge difference to the health care landscape in rural Nova Scotia. As these centres open, we will see fewer and fewer ER closures across the province. Rural Nova Scotians will have better access to primary care during the day and patients will get to see their family doctor before an urgent issue becomes a major health crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, people will have consistent care from an appropriate health care provider during the evening hours. Another benefit of CECs is that physicians and other health care providers will have greater control over their work life. For all these reasons, I am so pleased to announce that this government is investing $6.8 million to develop and operationalize new collaborative emergency centres across our province.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned above, this investment will go toward infrastructure upgrades to hospitals so that collaborative emergency centres are available to be established in more communities throughout Nova Scotia. An example is the recent paving that was done in the parking lot at the Parrsboro CEC. This new parking lot will better enable patient access to this facility. Or, we recently announced a new health care facility for the Pugwash community. This new facility will be redesigned to accommodate a CEC. In Springhill, we are investing in a redesign of the reception area, new sinks, new security system and an upgrade to the parking lot. These changes will make this facility safer and more accessible.</p>
<p>In short, this $6.8 million investment will go toward building modifications to allow for improved streaming of patients and privacy, needed upgrades for infrastructure components like call systems, security, data and voice communication as well medical equipment such as exam tables and furnishings for exam rooms and waiting areas.</p>
<p>As Dr. Ross pointed out, changing the system takes into account the distinct needs of each community. It's about supporting communities and making the right decisions on how to match services to real needs. It's also about making the best use of the time and skills of our doctors, nurses, paramedics, our 811 nurse line and all who provide care as part of a more effective 24/7 emergency care system.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the health care providers, including doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, paramedics and other health care providers as well as DHA officials who have embraced and are working hard to implement Collaborative Emergency Centres. All these individuals are showing tremendous leadership in wanting to provide the best health care possible, they are improving our system in ways that are better for patients. Collaborative Emergency Centres are one commitment of Better Care Sooner, government's plan for improving the health system in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Today I want to reaffirm my commitment to working hard putting this plan into action. I will also continue to rely on the ideas and energies in community and we will work through this journey together to improve health care across this province to deliver Better Care Sooner, stability, and peace of mind. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#ea522cb5-76c2-4f6d-920c-5b1835704b1a"><from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I want to first of all thank the minister for an advance copy of her ministerial statement today. I, too, welcome Mr. Saunders and Mr. Bruce Quigley, who I know as a colleague of my wife at Soldiers Memorial Hospital for a number of years. I want to welcome them both here today.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Health Minister's statement. It is interesting that we are here discussing an investment in Collaborative Emergency Centres. Two and a half years ago, we heard the NDP discussing investments in emergency rooms and a promise - or commitment, depending on who you ask - to keep them open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>After making this promise, Nova Scotians lived through an increasing number of emergency room closures, more than under the previous MacDonald Government. In fact, in November 2008 the then-NDP Leader criticized the MacDonald Government for the number of ER closures. He said, "Instead of spending the last three years recruiting and retaining doctors, this government seems to be suggesting that some emergency rooms are just not necessary." He added that the solution to so many ER closures was, " &#x2026; to get rid of that crew over there."</p>
<p>It's interesting that this government does not show interest in recruiting and retaining. We've offered solutions to help recruit doctors, but this government was not interested. We presented a plan to bring 100 new doctors to Nova Scotia over a period of five years, and the government said no. We asked that the seats originally designated to Saudi students but not filled by Saudi students go to Nova Scotians, but this government said no. Mr. Speaker, it appears that the Premier is still correct when he said it seems as though this government is just not interested in keeping ERs open. Instead, we invest in closing ERs for another model.</p>
<p>Also interesting is that in October 2008, the then-NDP Health Critic and now Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage said, "From all I've seen over the last number of years, the government really hasn't done a lot on addressing the ER closures."</p>
<p>Again, this statement still applies today. We actually witnessed an increase in the number of ER closures across this province under this government. In a telling 2007 op-ed, the NDP stated, "The emergency room at the Digby General Hospital was closed for more than 55 days this year because of a lack of rural physicians. Another seven emergency rooms across the province also suffered closures this year. The Conservatives have failed to act, even when the local district health authority pleaded for emergency funding to attract a doctor."</p>
<p>We now know that they are not committed to keeping emergency rooms open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Instead, they are committed to defining away a problem. They are not even interested in ensuring all Collaborative Emergency Centres are kept running. One in Berwick was only missing a minor adjustment. The Liberal caucus has carefully outlined how government cuts resulted in changes to the Berwick clinic, changes that reduce its hours and leave it open less days. These changes are also putting additional pressure on emergency rooms in the area. The community has asked for the clinic to be supported, but that support did not come.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we stand here and we're asked to celebrate a $6.8 million investment while the shadow of more than $50 million in health cuts stands over our heads.</p>
<p>We heard from the Colchester East Hants Health Authority's CEO, Peter MacKinnon, on the health cuts: "No question it is significant and it will have a local impact." In the same story, Danny Cavanagh, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said, "How do they expect our health care system to withstand this magnitude of cuts?"</p>
<p>IWK president and CEO Anne McGuire said health cuts will mean trying to do more with fewer staff. The IWK's CFO added, "This amount of money is going to impact care and it's going to have to change care."</p>
<p>We know the opinion of this government and this minister when it comes to health. The minister talks about same-day or next-day access to primary health care - it is on my Christmas wish list, and it is the dream for tens of thousands of Nova Scotians. The mantra in the Valley is becoming more "great care later." Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, would like to thank the minister for providing us with her comments here this afternoon, and also welcome Mr. Quigley and Mr. Saunders here to the House today. They are, of course, known as the two Bruces in Cumberland County and I'm delighted that they are here today - the two people who are in charge of Cumberland Health.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's very important that Nova Scotians get the care that they need when they need it, where they need it regardless of where they live in our province, whether they are in downtown Halifax, or Advocate, Nova Scotia, or in any other part of the province. I do want to recognize the employees, the medical staff, and the administrative staff - all of the staff of Cumberland Health, including the leadership team there, who have worked so hard to make the Collaborative Emergency Centre in Parrsboro a reality and are now working in other locations within Cumberland County to try to make this new scheme work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I say that knowing that the staff there feel privileged to have been selected as among the first sites in the province and if there is a place in Nova Scotia where this new arrangement can be made to serve the people, it is in Cumberland County thanks to the staff of Cumberland Health. The minister made reference to the Parrsboro CEC at the South Cumberland Community Care Centre and I know that the government wishes to hold that up as a model for other places in Cumberland County and indeed someday, perhaps, around Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I do want to point out as MLA for the area that the staff there are doing their best and are making it work but it is not a perfect situation and I don't pretend to say the minister said it was perfect, but there are hiccups that needs to be worked out. I will say that paving the parking lot is nice but the residents of Parrsboro, and of all Cumberland County, are more concerned about what goes on inside the care centre than the paving, as nice as it is to have outside. The fact of the matter is that one of the things that are special about the Parrsboro Care Centre is that it has a medical clinic right next door and a long-term care facility located in the care centre.</p>
<p>One of the pieces of feedback that I'm getting as MLA is that it is at times a strain on the nursing staff that is trying to service both, particularly in the evening hours when they have a call on their time in the long-term care facility and are also needed at the Collaborative Emergency Centre. There have been a few hiccups around staffing it as I know the minister knows, I've certainly shared that with here, but more importantly I just want to say that I know that the staff there are working very hard to try to make it work.</p>
<p>My other point about Parrsboro, Mr. Speaker, is that Parrsboro is not Springhill, it is not Pugwash, it is not any other community that many end up with one of these Collaborative Emergency Centres, and so this is not a situation where a one-size-fits-all model will work. In fact, I know that the people of Springhill, for example, are very anxious to see how the Parrsboro model can work in a very different hospital where the immediately surrounding services are not the same as in Parrsboro. I suspect in Pugwash it's the same situation and I just want to point out that this may not well be the solution for all the communities of Nova Scotia as the government intends.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am giving credit to the staff of Cumberland Health for a variety of reasons including the very important reason that this is not what was province by the government in the run-up to the last election. The government, full stop, promised emergency care 24/7, no closures. It now falls to Cumberland Health and someday to all Nova Scotia health authorities to try to make this new model work but it's not what was promised.</p>
<p>I did hear the minister say that she looks for stability in the health care system. Well, Mr. Speaker, a great definition of stability is a government that keeps its promises after the election. Then we can have better planning in health care, better management of our health care resources, and not deal with the instability of trying to make something work that was not what was promised prior to the election.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Speaker, as the staff of Cumberland Health works through the CEC model, doing their best to make it work, they've now had another hand tied behind their back by a government that is determined that they cut 3 per cent out of their budget. As all Nova Scotians know, and certainly as the staff of Cumberland Health knows, the 3 per cent is really a much higher number when you include wage settlements and when you include health care inflation in the number. Estimates as high as 10 per cent cuts come on a real-time basis and they are going to have to deal with that, just like all the health authorities are going to have to deal with that.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, just in conclusion, I will point out that the Cumberland Health Authority deserves a lot of credit for doing their best, under difficult circumstances, to try to make something work that was not promised and to try to make it work when they're facing such draconian cuts by this government. I congratulate them on the efforts they're making.</p></speech>

We also are joined by Sarah Withrow of Withrow's Farm Market in Elmsdale and Cheryl Williams of Shani's Farm in Scotch Village, who are all members of Select Nova Scotia.

<p>Gordon and Joachim are part of the I Love Local (HFX) movement, which aims to highlight and promote the great independent businesses in Halifax. This local movement currently has about 60 members including local businesses like Hamachi House, Brooklyn Warehouse, The Trail Shop, Chives Canadian Bistro, Woozles, One Stop Wood Shop, and many, many more.

        <speech by="#e63ef392-23cc-461a-bb21-5b72f51f8cc2"><from>HON. PERCY PARIS</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House today in an effort to urge the members of this House and all Nova Scotians to think local when shopping for gifts this holiday season. In fact, I would like to extend the challenge to those who have not finished or who haven't even begun their holiday shopping. I would challenge them to buy at least 10 per cent of their gifts locally or from locally-owned businesses.</p>
<p>I am certain that all members of this House will agree that buying local is important for our local economy and for the people and the communities of Nova Scotia. Money spent in locally-owned businesses stays here in the province. It's money that goes towards the wages of Nova Scotians, sustaining them and allowing them to branch out with new product development and manufacturing. It's money that helps our local restaurants, book stores, manufacturers, local arts and culture, farmers, fishermen, and many, many more.</p>
<p>One group that supports this idea wholeheartedly is I Love Local (HFX). As I said in my introduction, this is a group of Halifax-based businesses committed to promoting the overall health of locally-owned businesses through joint marketing and community engagement. But it isn't all about Halifax. Buying local is something all Nova Scotians in every corner of the province should practise. Our government and the folks at I Love Local (HFX) want to take their message to the rest of Nova Scotia as well.</p>
<p>Another way to keep things local this holiday season is to celebrate local food by applying to host an IncrEDIBLE Community Supper this winter. These suppers are part of the Select Nova Scotia campaign to feature locally-produced foods. Events like these bring together communities with their local farmers and processors, not to mention supporting local farm businesses, which helps create good jobs and build a stronger economy - buying local hits home.</p>
<p>When you give your friends and family Nova Scotia-made goods for the holidays, you're also giving a gift to all the farmers, all the fishermen, all the producers, all the artists, all the locally-owned retailers, and more, in our province. I encourage the members of this House and all Nova Scotians to buy local. Thank you.</p></speech>

GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for an advance copy of his comments this afternoon, and also thank Brandon from his office, who is a great guy and a really good guy to deal with. I would join the minister in welcoming I Love Local (HFX) to the gallery. Welcome aboard.</p>
<p>Of course, the importance of buying local is something which all members of the Legislature can agree on. We all know the businesses in our ridings and the families who take on the risks associated with opening and running their own businesses. We should be supporting these businesses and we should be encouraging everyone to think locally when shopping for Christmas presents this year.</p>
<p>But it goes further than that. We need to think about our local businesses all year round. The government has tools at their disposal which would greatly support the small-business community, yet they have not fully engaged with all the tools that would make our Nova Scotian businesses more competitive and more successful. This government raised the HST, a move that adversely affects local businesses. This government went back on a commitment to index income tax brackets; this is an issue that often gets lost in nuance, but it affects small businesses and it affects Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>This government has ensured Nova Scotia remains uncompetitive and has made our province a little bit more unfriendly to business since taking office. While we do agree with the minister's statement that supporting local businesses is important - and they certainly do deserve our support - our businesses need much more than talk. We need this government to act to make us more competitive, and they need to start now.</p>
<p>It is important that we all make a conscious effort to buy local this holiday season, and indeed, throughout the entire year. Let's support local businesses by purchasing their goods and services, and as legislators, let's support our businesses by creating a business environment where those who risk it all can survive. Thank you.</p></speech>

EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, firstly I would like to thank the minister for providing me with an advance copy of his remarks today. I would also like to take the time to acknowledge the comments made by my colleague in the Official Opposition.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome our visitors in the gallery from I Love Local (HFX) as well. The minister began his remarks by extending a challenge to those who have not yet finished their holiday shopping. The minister challenged them to buy at least 10 per cent of their goods locally or from locally-owned businesses - a lofty goal indeed, and one which members of the PC caucus support.</p>
<p>I would like to answer the minister's challenge with a challenge of my own: to get serious about buying local. When this caucus introduced the Buy Nova Scotia First bill last April, our members had hoped the government would move quickly to adopt our very sensible proposals. The Buy Nova Scotia First bill required all provincial government institutions to buy Nova Scotia food first before searching out of province. Considering that only $65 million of the $2.3 billion Nova Scotians spend on food annually is spent buying local, the members of the PC caucus expected the government would act graciously and welcome the legislation after all. The Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture did. Unfortunately, this would not be the case.</p>
<p>The government has failed to move forward with our legislation and they failed to provide any real alternative. If the minister is serious about buying local, then I have some questions for him, why did his Cabinet and his colleagues support the decision to introduce first contract arbitration, a policy that may drive business away from Nova Scotia? Why did he encourage his colleagues to buy local when they bought their new paving plant? It's one thing for the minister to stand in this House and make speeches about the importance of buying local but it's time that he actually did something about it. By going back to the Cabinet Table and urging his colleagues to move ahead with the Buy Nova Scotia First Act, the minister will be providing real support to Nova Scotia producers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I look forward to seeing the minister accept my challenge and come forward with a real buy local plan. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM. - HEALTH CARE: CUTBACKS - CONTINGENCY PLAN</heading>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. The federal Finance Minister has signalled that Ottawa will not keep increasing health transfers by 6 per cent beyond the current agreement. This government has already directed cuts to health of $46 million which, when you combine with inflation projections, have a potential to affect the Health budget by more than $90 million. The $46 million cuts were based on the assumptions of certain envelopes and among other sources of money, obviously, to the federal health transfer.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier is what contingency plan does the Premier have to deal with the federal cutbacks to health care?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, as you would know, the federal health transfer arrangement still has some time to run. We're not expecting to see any impact in that in this year or for that matter next year. There was an agreement over the course of the election that that would be extended for, I think they said two years. The important thing for people to know, though, is that although it has been kind of widely reported that Nova Scotia has a 6 per cent escalator in health care funding, that's not actually true.</p>
<p>In fact, what happens is the actual pool, the national pool, increases by 6 per cent. We get our share of that which doesn't turn out to be 6 per cent, it's something less, but obviously anything that affects the health transfers into the province would be of grave concern to us. I'm sure the Leader of the Official Opposition would know that just as recently as a few days ago my colleagues and I, in the Council of Atlantic Premiers, addressed this in a communiqu&#xE9; and obviously we are going into those negotiations not accepting the position of the federal government. We are going in to say we expect them to live up to the commitment, say, in the Romanow Commission but also to put in place a decent escalator which recognizes the expansion of health costs each year.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I believe the Premier is correct, I believe the program will be extended to 2015, 2016, with the federal government. The Premier has already insisted that our provincial health care system make 3 per cent cuts this year. Now the federal Conservatives are indicating that they will be making cuts to health transfers when the current agreement runs out. This is going to put a tremendous strain on the provincial health care system at a time when we are dealing with an aging population and a low economic growth.</p>
<p>So again my question to the Premier is, what is the Premier going to do in order to mitigate this setback which is being pushed by the federal Conservative Government?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>First let me begin by thanking the Leader of the Official Opposition for recognizing the continuing role of this government past 2016. I think that's a significant watermark in the House, Mr. Speaker, but furthermore, what I would say is that the question of health care funding in our country is one that will come back to the forefront as these health care negotiations come to the forefront and what we have said is that over the last number of years, despite a significant escalator, there has been a slide in the actual percentage of health care costs in the province that are covered by the contribution of the federal government. In fact, it has gone from 23 per cent, and I believe this year will actually slide below 20 per cent in terms of the contribution of the federal government.</p>
<p>We think it's enormously important that one of the fundamental tenets of the upcoming transfer is to reset the base, in other words to get back to the projected base that the Romanow Commission put in place originally, which was the 25 per cent. Then the question of the escalator, I think, is a fair one with respect to accountability on the provincial end. We're not afraid of that, in fact, we've said we would like to partner with the federal government when it comes to the question of accountability. We believe that the tax money of the people of Canada should be spent wisely and we're willing to do our part in that regard.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that if the Premier were to check Hansard, whenever it's out, I never suggested this government would be there in 2015, 2016. What I suggested was that the federal program would be there until 2015, 2016. I would strongly suggest that the Premier not be arrogant enough to prejudge what Nova Scotians will do in the next election. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the NDP has already frozen budgets last year. This year the Premier will demand $90 million cuts from our provincial health care system, again, all the while insisting that his cuts will have no impact on patients or patient care. So my question to the Premier is, is the Premier concerned that these federal cuts to health care will impact patients and patient care?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, obviously we would be concerned about any cut to federal transfers. One of the realities of the relationship between the federal and provincial governments is that we have many, many transfers that take place. I think we have something in the order of 32 different agreements which result in transfers to the province for the purposes of providing services to the people of Nova Scotia. We are equally aware of the necessity of that funding to continue in each one of those envelopes. The reality is that you could get a very good agreement on health care transfers, but if you lose on the other 31 agreements, that has the same effect on the overall budget of the province. It means there's simply less money coming in.</p>
<p>What we're doing is working with the district health authorities to find ways to ensure that we can maximize the value of the service to our citizens and reduce the costs to the degree that we are able. One of the ways that we've done that already is by shrinking the level of administrative costs from one of the highest in the country to below the national average.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, every day it becomes more clear that this Premier loves to advertise - perhaps he should get an audition for the TV show <i>Mad Men</i>. The latest example: his government is spending at least $160,000 on its new Our Future Starts Here marketing campaign. My question to the Premier is, how can he justify spending at least $160,000 of taxpayers' money on an advertising campaign during these tough economic times?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the purpose of those ads is to take advantage - something that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has said should be done - of the fact that we have an enormous opportunity in front of us, one that will literally lift the economy of our province over the next couple of decades.</p>
<p>What those ads do is describe accurately the opportunity that is going to be there, and the way that young people - people who are now not in the workforce - can take best advantage of that opportunity so that we have the skilled tradespeople, so that we take maximum advantage of the opportunity that is in front of us. If we don't do it now, when does the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party think we should do it?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what the people of Nova Scotia want the government to do is to do the real work of taking advantage of the shipyard opportunity, not spend more of their money patting themselves on the back and taking credit for it. It's funny how times change. Today the Premier stands up and defends his advertising campaign, but in December 2005, when in Opposition, his own Minister of Finance was against doing exactly what the Premier is now doing. At that time he said that he was against putting communications ahead of doing their job properly. My question is, will the Premier admit that spending $160,000 on an ad campaign only proves that he is now putting communications ahead of doing his job properly?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>No, Mr. Speaker. In fact, every government has budgets that are designed to market the opportunities that are available in their province. In this particular instance, this is the delivery of information to people who will be taking part in the largest economic opportunity in a generation in this province. It is important that we use all avenues to get that information out to them so they can take best advantage of it. In fact, what we know already is that employers around the province are trying to figure out where they're going to get the skilled tradesmen that they're going to need in order to fill their place in the supply chain. This is important for employers, it's important for young people and it's important for the province.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what's important is that the government do the real work of getting ready and doing those things, not advertise, patting themselves on the back about the thought of doing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in defending these very ads the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism said, "We want Nova Scotians to feel good about themselves, to get up in the morning and want to look for new opportunities" Well, clearly those people that we want to get up and look for new opportunities include the many unemployed Nova Scotians that we have in our province today. But back in 2005, returning to the Minister of Finance, he said at that time that the people who are least economically advantaged are the ones who are least likely to be reached by a government advertising campaign. So I would like to ask the Premier, if his minister is right that government advertising campaigns don't reach the very people that we need to seek out new opportunities, will he commit to doing the right thing and having the government and the taxpayer reimbursed by the NDP Party for this frivolous, feel-good political advertising campaign.</p></speech>

But I would like to share with the House something that was said by the Saint Mary's University business professor Ed McHugh, who I'm sure is quite familiar to the members opposite.

            <p>My question is for the Premier, Mr. Speaker. The impact of diabetes on our health care system will not be going away anytime soon, with 77,000 Nova Scotians impacted by the disease and 500 new cases added each month. Both prevention and management of the disease are required. Four years ago the Government of Saskatchewan initiated an insulin pump program for children under the age of 18, and just last week they expanded that program to cover people up to the age of 25. My question to the Premier, if the insulin pump program has been so successful in Saskatchewan why is your government not willing to introduce one?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in addition to the expansion of the insulin pump program in Saskatchewan their government also moved the drug Lantus, a long-lasting insulin, to full formulary listing. This means the medical criteria is no longer required in Saskatchewan in order to have Lantus covered. In Nova Scotia we can't even get the government to list Lantus as an exceptional drug, let alone make it available on the formulary. So my question to the Premier, why are other provinces so advanced when it comes to addressing the needs of diabetics in their provinces and we are content to lag behind?</p>

The Common Drug Formulary Review did not recommend the listing of that drug and for that reason it's not on our formulary.</p>
<p>However, I would like to tell the Leader of the Official Opposition that yesterday I had an opportunity to meet with members of the diabetic program here in Nova Scotia and a paediatric endocrinologist from the IWK, who provided me with great insight into what her experience is in working with diabetic patients, children. Certainly she spoke very favourably about this particular drug. My department will look at the variety of information that was brought to us from the front line provider yesterday.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, through you to the minister, I want to tell her that Alberta and Atlantic Canada are the only provinces at the present time that do not have Lantus on the formulary. We are aware that the drug, Plavix, which is not used to treat diabetics, will be moving, in January, to a generic form of that particular drug which will save the province somewhere in and around $3 million. With that saving, with the idea that we know the minister is having her meetings more recently with the front line health care workers trying to deal with Nova Scotians with diabetes, I want to ask the Premier, through you, can Nova Scotians expect to see his government not only move on this drug, but to show some clear signal that we're prepared to invest in insulin pumps to help improve Nova Scotians treat this disease?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as you would know, of course, the departments are well aware of the way in which the drugs move into the generic status and the savings that would come from that. Those are already accounted for in the health care budgets in advance of the transition taking place. It's not actually a saving; it is a calculated reduction in the expense that is picked up elsewhere in the health care budget. We are constantly looking at ways to be able to improve the delivery of service to people in the province, whether it's through new technology, through new drugs that are coming on the market - these are things we are constantly monitoring - of course, we have the very difficult job of doing that within a fixed budget.</p>

On April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2011 this government awarded a $228,000 tender to Alberta-based Social Sector Metrics Incorporated along with Health Intelligence Systems Incorporated to produce a 10-year physician resource plan for the province. According to the department's press release issued on April 20<sup>th</sup>, the 10 year plan is needed to ensure government knows exactly what doctors are needed and where they will be needed, in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The tender stated that the contract shall not exceed six months, which means the minister should already have received the plan by November. This date is confirmed in the press release. My question to the minister is, can the minister confirm whether her department has received the physician resource plan as outlined in the tender and if not, why not?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as the press release states, we have a mal-distribution of physicians across the province. There are rural communities such as Yarmouth and towns in the Valley that have been experiencing shortage of physician services which is impacting emergency care and consistent primary care. These residents are waiting for the outcome of this report. However, if past experience of the minister is any indication of future behaviour, there will be considerable lapse of time before the public is informed of the contents of the report and what steps are next in the process. My question to the minister is, how long after receipt of the report can the public expect to be informed of the report's findings?</p>

All independent reports do demonstrate that Nova Scotia has the highest number of physicians per capita of any province in Canada. About 96 per cent of Nova Scotians have a family doctor, but there are areas in the province where there have been persistent challenges in terms of recruitment and retention of physicians.</p>
<p>We are doing planning for an aging physician population. The baby boom is affecting the potential of retirements for physicians, just like every other professional group. So this is a forward-looking plan that will take us forward for a 10-year period. I believe we will be the first province in Canada to have developed such a plan. As I indicated, I have yet to receive the work of the working group, but I anticipate that I will have it before the Christmas holiday.</p></speech>

Communities are waiting to hear about physician needs in their communities, and according to the minister in The ChronicleHerald dated March 12, 2011, even decisions around the expansion of the Dal Medical School hinge on the content of this report.</p>
<p>My final question to the minister is, when can Nova Scotians expect specific actions and commitments from government which will address the findings of this report?</p></speech>

That is a difficult issue, when people move out of the province to avoid their responsibilities, especially when there are children and the family structure left behind in Nova Scotia. Our government has put priorities on individuals and working with the other provinces in trying to find ways to make collaborative efforts in that consultation. That is ongoing and we have made great strides in reducing the overall income by about 10 per cent. We'll continue to work in that vein.

That is more than $83 million owed to Nova Scotia families.

According to Lucille Harper, the executive director of the Antigonish Women's Resource Centre and Sexual Assault Services Association says:</p>
<blockquote>There needs to be a greater commitment to ensure the program is effective and meets the needs of the primary parent, generally mothers in this province, and needs to recognize the impact the lack of an effective program has on family economics. In cases where there is a history of violence and abuse, it leaves women in a place of increased vulnerability. </blockquote>
<p>Mr. Speaker, she didn't say that five years ago - she's talking about today. I will ask the minister, does he recognize the effect that inaction has on families in Nova Scotia who are in need of maintenance enforcement and will he commit, under his watch, today, to fixing this broken program and ensure that these families are looked after, as they are legally entitled to be?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. As part of the deal that Cabinet put together with Bowater, Nova Scotia Power has added a load-shifting credit of $0.5 million per year. Would the Premier please explain to the House how this portion of the agreement will work, how it might affect other ratepayers in the province, and what amount of energy Bowater would be entitled to?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>The way it works is that a credit is given to Bowater for using power at points of time in the day when the demand goes down. As the member opposite would know, the ability of the power company to supply power works at a certain peak level, when it cycles down and up that actually causes increased costs in the overall running of the utility. Because Bowater will pick up the slack and operate at times when the utility is going through a slacker time for the call on the electricity that's being generated, they will be given credit for shifting their work cycle in order to match the ability of the utility to provide the load at that period.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#5d4cd4b5-5ca2-425c-82a5-49a49892eee6"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Premier's clarification because it is slightly different from what the department has been saying. Another part of the deal would actually have Brooklyn Energy, which is of course one of the companies associated, access or supply additional energy and we've been told by the Department of Energy that that will come in through the Community Feed-in Tariff Program which is why it was not part of the legislation. The only concern with that, or one of the concerns with that, of course, is there are actually only 3.3 megawatts of energy available, or space available, according to Nova Scotia Power, in that area to tap in, which means that any energy that Brooklyn Energy now puts on there will shut out other renewable energy suppliers in the area.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, it appears that Bowater will be able to use up most, if not all, of the available COMFIT space on the grid in that area, according to Nova Scotia Power. So would the Premier please explain why they felt that it should be structured in that way?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Well, just to be clear for the member opposite, that's different than load shifting, that's a different component of what takes place. This is about putting in place an additional piece of technology, the topping turbine, which will essentially use the steam that's already being created but is now currently way steam. So this creates green energy which will be sold into the grid at the COMFIT rate. We're told that there is enough capacity to ensure that that comes on and is part of the overall green energy makeup of the grid and, frankly, Mr. Speaker, this should be a good thing. If it's a good thing for Bowater, it will be a good thing for Nova Scotia and, of course, it's a good thing for the province.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#5d4cd4b5-5ca2-425c-82a5-49a49892eee6"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think the Premier is maybe misunderstanding the concern. It's not the fact that there's a problem with green energy or the topping turbine, or anything else. The problem is that there are renewable energy suppliers that are going to create jobs in the Queens County area that now, according to Nova Scotia Power and the Department of Energy, will be shut out because the energy access that they would have used will now be used up by Brooklyn Energy. There's a finite amount of power, or a finite space available.</p>
<p>The URB has ruled there's 3.3 megawatts of electricity available in the Brooklyn area, the Brooklyn-Liverpool area, and a number of renewable energy suppliers have indicated very clearly that, obviously all the ones that felt they would be able to access that 3.3 megawatts will now not be able to because whatever Brooklyn Energy accesses will now not be available to others who were planning to create new jobs in that area. That is information from the URB, the Department of Energy and Nova Scotia Power, all saying the same thing.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, the question is, you know, they've talked about 2,000 jobs and all kinds of other things. Why did they not take into account the lost economic opportunities from the renewable energy suppliers who will now be shut out of accessing that part of the grid and creating new green jobs in Queens?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, what the member opposite should have said is that that's his understanding of what was said by Nova Scotia Power and the URB, and whoever else he was talking to, but that's not the case. In fact, those people who are currently in the queue who are looking to become contributors to the green energy makeup in the province will still have the opportunity to access that through the COMFIT Program. We're working with them now to develop new green energy alternatives and we're going to continue to do that over the coming years.</p>

Nova Scotia, as you know, is one of the few provinces in Canada that doesn't offer any funding for insulin pumps and in November, I think a lot of members of this House of Assembly attended a dinner with the Canadian Diabetes Association. They released a report that shows a provincial investment in a publicly-funded insulin pump program could improve health outcomes for Nova Scotians with diabetes and save the province up to $1.4 million by 2032. I will table that release as soon as I can pull it out of my book here.</p>
<p>Two of the goals the government has often quoted in the Better Health Care Sooner plan are to improve health outcomes and use health dollars better. This morning in Public Accounts we heard from the deputy minister that the department refuses to consider a publicly-funded insulin program when a publicly-funded insulin program clearly fits into the government's stated goals. Why won't the minister fund insulin pumps in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we currently have programs to assist people with diabetes in Nova Scotia. We spend approximately $19 million annually to assist people. There are four other provinces that have insulin pump programs for some portion of their diabetic population; there are two provinces that have announced they will implement programs, and we have yet to see the details of what those programs look like.</p>
<p>As I indicated in a previous question, Mr. Speaker, I met yesterday with a pediatric endocrinologist from the IWK. I was interested in hearing from someone with expertise on the front line what the experience is with insulin pumps, for whom insulin pumps would be useful. It was a very interesting meeting. This particular physician came very well prepared with a number of suggestions, of which insulin pumps were actually not the top priority.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ideas that are being presented to the department from people with expertise in terms of what we need to do to improve the kinds of treatment we have available, and I will be guided by people with expertise in this area of health care.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from>
            <p>In November the Canadian Diabetes Association forecast a 44 per cent rise in diabetes in Nova Scotia over the next 10 years. The association estimated that the direct and indirect financial impacts of diabetes in Nova Scotia currently cost the province $383 million per year. By 2020 the association believes that these costs will increase to nearly half a billion dollars if action is not taken. A public insulin pump program could save the province money - $1.4 million by 2032, according to the association. So why won't the minister act now to control the economic cost to the province and soften the human cost associated with diabetes?</p>

          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as the honourable member no doubt knows, insulin pumps are probably the most expensive form of treatment that we could look at. A pump can cost $5,000 to $6,000, and the supplies can be approximately $400 a month. The life of an insulin pump is limited, so they need replacement every five years or so. It's a very, very costly form of intervention.</p>
<p>As I indicated, yesterday the pediatric endocrinologist had a number of very interesting insights into other requirements that people with diabetes have, which may in fact give us better outcomes for more effective use of our health care dollars. As I've indicated, Mr. Speaker, I very much take the approach of looking at value for dollar in the health care system, and I am guided by people in the front lines of health care who know what they're talking about based on their practice experience.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#54c01d3a-9d00-4849-8acd-59f8efd8a2f9"><from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from><p>We do understand the cost associated with an insulin pump. Insulin pumps sometimes cost between $4,000 and $7,000, depending on the model that you're getting - a figure that is, of course, out of reach by many Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The Canadian Diabetes Association, in a press release that I tabled earlier, tells a story of a nine-year-old Halifax girl who uses a pump. Her family says the device is a life-changer for the entire family and has restored the girl's childhood.</p>
<p>We know, right now, that about 700 children have type 1 diabetes, and we do know that not all 700 children would require a pump, but maybe a number of those might require them. Since it does have such a restorative effect to a child's childhood, allows them to be a kid, why won't the minister help families, like this little girl's, get better care now, and fund insulin pumps for children?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the member is correct, insulin pumps aren't for every person with diabetes or, indeed, for every child with diabetes. The physicians at the IWK, for example, have access to a fund called the Emily Fund, which is specifically a fund that assists families for whom an insulin pump would be a benefit, but are unable to acquire because they don't have private insurance - so quite often children are able to access these pumps through that program.</p>
<p>There are many, many questions that need to be asked around introducing an insulin pump program in Nova Scotia. I know I've heard one of the members on the other side saying, well, what about other provinces that have these programs? The other provinces that have these programs have not done any evaluations on either the health impact or the cost benefit of the insulin pump programs. These programs are too new to have that kind of information.</p>
<p>We will gather all of the information around insulin pumps and their effectiveness, as we consider what the interventions are that we will invest in and for what parts of our population will these interventions yield good health outcomes and give us good value for dollar, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

This program is advertised in the paper, it's advertised at food banks - as a matter of fact I think the department actually sends out to people who previously subscribed to the program, so people in other years who have used the program, the information is sent to them and, as well, is sent to all the MLA offices.</p>

It comes to our attention that people who are eligible for rebates on pellet stoves are either unaware or have great difficulty finding proper information and forms to apply for this rebate. For Nova Scotians, bureaucracy is very difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what further steps has the minister taken in order to ensure that all programs and rebates in his department are clearly publicized and easy to access for all Nova Scotians?</p></speech>

            <p>I'm not sure if I caught the actual question, but every agency that deals with low-income individuals, people who we would think would probably be those who might want to access these programs, is sent this information. I think there are over 100 agencies in this province that get this information. I have to say, as minister for the department, this is not one - even as an MLA - that I actually say that I've encountered, that this is a problem for people to get this information. It seems to get out there and be well used.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in one particular case constituents approached various wood-pellet stove dealers to ask about the availability of a rebate. None of these dealers were aware of any rebates so these people were then sent to Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations. It took them many phone calls to find the proper person, through Access Nova Scotia, and even then the person they spoke to was unclear of how to qualify for the rebate and even uncertain what specific rebate to suggest. This is a problem. When Access Nova Scotia representatives are unclear about programs and rebates, it makes it that much more difficult for Nova Scotians to be able to navigate through the system. What is the minister going to do in order to improve and streamline the system so that Nova Scotians will be able to navigate through an often bewildering process to qualify and obtain rebates that they're entitled to?</p>

(Interruptions)</p>
<p>If golf courses are what excite the minister, there are a couple of world-class golf courses in Cape Breton. Tourism is down in Cape Breton; room nights sold dropped by 10,000 between January and September this year over the same period last year. The minister has done nothing to promote Cape Breton as a unique destination.</p>

This Friday the rehabilitation pool located in the rehab centre on Summer Street will cease to operate. In-patients of the rehab who have enjoyed the immense health benefits associated with therapeutic hydrotherapy will either have to be transported outside the centre to another community facility or go without. The reason for the disruption in service? Budget constraints imposed by the province.</p>
<p>These budget constraints are only going to get worse under the NDP Government. My question to the minister is, how is it acceptable to this minister that therapeutic hydrotherapy will no longer be accessible to in-patients of the rehab centre?</p></speech>

The closure of that particular facility has nothing to do with budget constraints. The pool at the rehab centre is quite old, and they've had many problems with it over the last year or so, to the extent that there have been leaks on floors below where that pool is located. The Capital District Health Authority has decided, in the interest of patient safety and the functioning of the rehab centre as a whole, that it is best that that particular facility be closed. They are moving forward with that plan.</p>
<p>There is a working group in the Capital District Health Authority that is looking at what the alternatives are with respect to hydrotherapy.</p></speech>

GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, individuals who have had strokes, sustained a head or spinal cord injury, suffer from MS or MD, and even those with severe chronic pain will suffer as a result of this decision. In-patients seeking therapy will now have to pay for the use of a community pool, will need to dress and be transported to an off-site facility, and then be removed from their wheelchairs in order to access the replacement pool - the stress alone will negate the benefits received.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, given that hydrotherapy enables patients to return to productive life sooner, and the minister is so fond of evidence-based decision making, how much will government be saving as a result of this short-sighted decision?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#ea522cb5-76c2-4f6d-920c-5b1835704b1a"><from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness.</p>
<p>Last week I asked the Minister of Health and Wellness to provide some justification for the changes brought forward by the NDP Government around the Home Oxygen Program. While government insists that changes were necessary to save money, the reality is money could have been saved and massive disruption for clients could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Besides the minister's cost-savings rationale, the minister went on to say she was pleased with the transition. I would like to table the following letter from a couple in Newport, Hants County, which states: "The transition, in my opinion, was too fast and too disorganized, it caused us many hours of stress and uncertainty."</p>
<p>My question to the minister, if the transition was so smooth for the minister, why did Mr. and Mrs. Greenwood who, as clients, are the most important people in the process, feel otherwise?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know the honourable member doesn't really place a very high priority on getting value for the health care dollar, but that's not the approach that this minister is taking. Home oxygen programs in Nova Scotia were very uncompetitive when we looked across the country with respect to what other provinces were paying for home oxygen. We knew that we could get a better deal for the taxpayers and we also knew that we were able to deliver high-quality services. So we put the home oxygen programs out to tender. We had a fair and open tendering process. The results of that process were announced and a number of companies were successful in the various DHAs.</p>
<p>The clients of the Home Oxygen Program were all notified of the changes; they were notified that they would have a choice between providers and, Mr. Speaker, the process I think will not only result in better value for dollar for the taxpayer, but a continuation of high-quality home oxygen services for patients throughout Nova Scotia.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#ea522cb5-76c2-4f6d-920c-5b1835704b1a"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Greenwoods would have preferred a choice. They would have preferred to have avoided the stress associated with transition. I spoke to this couple and here is what I learned. Apparently the information package provided by the company they were forced to transition to was produced on Manitoba letterhead with Manitoba contact telephone numbers. Despite the fact that it was all new equipment to the Greenwoods, no information was provided on what to do in the case of a power failure which, unfortunately, is a far-too-frequent event in this province.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, does the minister find it acceptable that the Greenwoods were provided with out-of-province contact information and no information as to how to handle their new equipment in the event of a power outage, yes or no?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there were a number of companies that were successful, through the fair and open tendering process, including numerous Nova Scotia companies. The company that the member refers to is from another province but is only one of a number of companies that were successful in getting the contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this means that we get better value for our health care dollars in Nova Scotia. We have a competitive situation now and we will continue to monitor the Home Oxygen Program to ensure that people are getting the services that they require.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#ea522cb5-76c2-4f6d-920c-5b1835704b1a"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the minister knows very well that the Atlantic respiratory association told her that they would be competitive with any company but it wasn't a very transparent process that took place. The Greenwoods have agreed to speak out. Other patients of the Home Oxygen Program are likely frustrated but are afraid to do so for fear that service will be discontinued. They are also fearful that once they do speak out, the limited choices available in each of the districts may become that much more limited.</p>
<p>My final question to the minister is, what process has the minister established to capture complaints about service delivery under this newly-structured NDP Home Oxygen Program that will assure clients they can freely speak without repercussions to service?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3663e5bf-7f5e-4b7d-a021-669a4f8ab4bc"><from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I still haven't found a little dungeon over in the Department of Health and Wellness where we lock up people who express their dissatisfaction with the health care system. It doesn't seem to be a deterrent for a lot of people, in terms of expressing their views on the health care system.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue. Providing home oxygen to people in Nova Scotia is important in my department, and we wanted to ensure that we were getting value for dollar while ensuring high-quality care. We had a fair and open process. The company that the member referred to, when he said the process wasn't transparent, in fact, was the successful company in at least three of the DHAs. So I really don't know what the member is trying to get at but I am satisfied that we did have a fair process. I am satisfied that Nova Scotian companies were able to successfully compete and I am satisfied that the program will offer quality services to people who require them.</p></speech>

            <p>Well, you know, Mr. Speaker, both this minister and the previous minister have said in questioning, in very similar questions over the past few years, that they support the work of the commission, which we obviously all appreciate since they are required by an Act of the Legislature to do that. Their total funding has decreased since the NDP took power, of course, much like other things. But one of the questions that I've asked this minister and the previous minister is about appointments to the commission, which the Executive Council is responsible to. There are now 12 positions on the board and seven of them remain vacant, two and a half years later. I asked two years ago, I asked last year, and they're still vacant. Can the minister tell us when he finally plans to make those appointments to the Shubenacadie Canal Commission?</p>

            <p>Certainly, the Shubenacadie Canal Commission - we're looking, as the member asked, around options for funding and I know the commission itself is looking at a fundraising initiative and we'll certainly be supportive of that. As far as the commission members, we've recently appointed one new member; there are two others in process that are going through, so that will be another three additional members that will now be there. We're always looking for good candidates to serve on the Shubenacadie Canal Commission and if that honourable member or any others have suggestions, we would certainly welcome those to come forward.</p>

YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate that the minister is moving a couple of appointments through but there are more than enough applications that the commission has brought to his attention, and has written letters to the minister's staff and office, so there are more than enough sitting there to be considered. Many of the people who have applied, and haven't even received acknowledgement, have contacted other members of the Legislature.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, one other issue that, of course, was brought up last year - and I'll table a letter from the minister to me about it from February 3, 2011 - is about the purchase of land of historical significance near the canal that the province has expressed an interest in. We understand that negotiations have been underway for some time since then, so will the minister advise the House the stage of the negotiations because we understand that they may be stalled?</p></speech>

In mid-November I was part of a delegation to Ottawa that met with the federal Minister of State for Transportation, regarding the MV <i>Miner</i>, which is on the shores of Scatarie Island. The Premier was on that trip, as well as the member for Glace Bay.</p>
<p>I know the Premier is aware of the importance of this ship's removal. It threatens to damage local sea life, as well as the health and safety of the people who live in the surrounding area. To this date I have not yet heard anything about the status of the ship's removal. The storm last week hit Cape Breton especially hard. Can the Minister of Natural Resources tell this House what the status of the removal of the MV <i>Miner</i> is?</p></speech>

CHARLIE PARKER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, certainly the Scatarie Island area is an important wilderness protection area in our province and we know that around that island there is an important fishery of scallops and lobsters and other species. We're trying to do everything we can to protect it. We've had ongoing meetings with our federal counterparts. As you know, the province spent somewhere in the vicinity of $300,000-plus for an environmental cleanup and to get any dangerous goods off the ship.</p>
<p>We are committed to working with our federal partners but, in reality, it was the federal government that allowed this ship to sail. We're hoping they'll have a policy in place to prevent any future accidents like this but we're committed to trying to find a solution to this issue.</p></speech>

MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there's been a lot of talk about what was and what wasn't going to happen around the site, to ensure that the MV <i>Miner</i> was not damaging the health and safety of people or the local sea life. Early this week there were reports of oil leaking from the engines. Now I've been out to the ship and there was a large hole in its hull at that time and it's gotten worse. Winter is fast approaching and I don't know if the ship will survive another storm. It's falling apart. On October 7<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Speaker, the Premier committed to make sure the ship is quickly removed, to avoid environmental damage.</p>
<p>We have not yet seen any action and time is critical. News reports indicate that there may be federal funding available for situations like the MV <i>Miner</i>. Has the minister pursued all avenues available to remove the ship? Has he worked with the federal government to come to an agreement on a course of action, or were the Premier's words in October empty?</p></speech>

We have been consistent in our insistence that the Department of Transport, Transport Canada, take its responsibility for what has happened to the MV <i>Miner</i>.</p>
<p>I guess the question I have is that we were all in that meeting. The member made a specific suggestion to the minister, Mr. Fletcher, and asked that they put together resources to actually address this. We have received no reply; perhaps the member has received a reply from his Conservative colleagues.</p></speech>

I'm going to make sure this doesn't happen. It's not going to be an environmental issue and I'll look after it. Well, he hasn't done that. Now he is over there and yes, I was in that meeting. Do you know what the difference is between me in the meeting and him? I went there with a plan to try and make a solution rather than just going there.</p>
<p>I've met with the Premier's Office, I've met with the minister's office and I've talked to the Transportation Minister in Ottawa. Now, all that being said, it is about what is important for the people and the sea life of that area. I know the best time for getting that ship removed was when it happened, but that hasn't happened. However, the minister and the Premier need to stop laying blame and get on with it. The structural integrity of the MV <i>Miner</i> has continued to deteriorate, and I'm sure we all know the clock is working against us. It's working against the sea life there and it's working against the people whose livelihood is involved. There is a simple question, before it's too late, will the Premier and the minister agree to immediately present a plan for the removal of the MV <i>Miner</i> from Scatarie Island as he promised in October?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, after intense pressure from the Liberal caucus and from Nova Scotians across the province, the government made a commitment that they would not venture any further into the world of on-line gambling. With ALC expanding to markets across the globe and to jurisdictions with very different laws and regulations on gambling, Nova Scotians have good reason to be concerned with the possibility that they may be moving away from that position. Has the minister made it clear to ALC that regardless of what markets they enter, Nova Scotia will not allow any proposals for on-line gambling expansion?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I think the government has been very clear on where we want to see gaming go in Nova Scotia. We announced our Gaming Strategy earlier this year and we really put that Gaming Strategy together with a lens of responsible gaming. We were the first jurisdiction in North America, if not in the world, to include in our Gaming Strategy a responsible gaming tool for VLTs in our province. That's a first of any jurisdiction, and I think that's a commitment that Nova Scotians can recognize that the government's taking seriously some of the reductions or harm-reduction tools that we will put into place here in Nova Scotia for those individuals who choose to use gaming as an avenue of their entertainment.</p>

GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, ALC is currently having trouble competing with on-line gambling operators, but this minister needs to ensure that Nova Scotians do not see government-sponsored on-line gambling develop here in the province. This includes Internet gambling, as well as gambling on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, let's be clear, the devastation which can occur with gambling on a computer in your own home is only increased exponentially with the portability and availability of gambling on mobile devices. What steps has the minister taken to ensure that Nova Scotia keeps its commitment to stay away from on-line gambling in all its forms, whether on computers or mobile devices?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#331409ea-d1b7-4360-84de-bcaf1d09e73d"><from>MR. WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, prior to us releasing our Gaming Strategy we took a wide consultation of those individuals in the province who have an interest in gaming, and not only from an entrepreneurial side of things but those individuals who use it, those individuals who might have had a negative effect of gaming. We are proud of the consultation that we received. I'm a little perplexed about the Liberal Party's interest in responsible gaming - during that consultation we asked both Parties for their input, and I have to acknowledge the Progressive Conservative Party forwarded some concerns that they have, but the Liberal Party chose not to take part in that consultation.

<p>So we're going to continue to make sure that the best interests of Nova Scotians are at heart when we do anything when it comes to gaming here in Nova Scotia.</p></speech>

<p>In November 2010, the Premier supported the ferry service between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island because he said it was a vital economic link between the two provinces - I agree, but why wasn't that same logic used when it comes to supporting the Yarmouth ferry, which brought millions of dollars into the economy of Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

            <p>In fact we did apply the same logic to both situations. The problem was that one was a sustainable service, one that's going to lead to greater economic development in the area, and the other one had a diminishing return. Unfortunately it was not meeting the objectives that would create more employment in the area and so we came to the regrettable decision that that $6 million a year, that was growing every year to more money, would be better used as an investment in economic development in the region.</p>

Again we have, this session of the Legislature, the Premier willing to give between $50 and $90 million to Bowater, the reason being to support the economy of the South Shore. All we're asking on this side is why that same logic - investing in important pieces of infrastructure, investing in business, investing in economic engines - wasn't applied when it came to the Yarmouth ferry, and why the Premier doesn't currently apply it right now?</p>

          <speech by="#dfa6c79b-dda1-4b1a-9850-3edfb6f1b3aa"><from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, just so everyone is clear which resolution we are speaking on, it's Resolution No. 2886 and the operative clause is:</p>
<p>"Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House remind the Premier and the rest of the NDP caucus that the next time they go door to door for an election campaign, they are going to have to answer for their broken promises and for making life simply less affordable for Nova Scotians."</p>
<p>Interestingly, today we had some business owners from Halifax in the east gallery, and I took the opportunity to stop and chat with several of those business owners. One of them said to me, I don't even know if I can continue doing business here in Nova Scotia. He spoke to a couple of particular issues - one was the increase in minimum wage which he says has decimated his bottom line, and the other is the increase in taxes. He said, I just don't know why I'm still in business. He says he's going to have to open more locations just because his margins are smaller.</p>
<p>As we begin discussion of this particular resolution I just wanted to draw the members' attention to that particular conversation today because I think it sort of underlines a dichotomy here. There's a dichotomy between what the NDP think they're doing and what everybody else knows they're doing. If we look at, in fact, their record of broken promises, it's pretty clear what they're doing. In the 2009 election the NDP promised to bring change to Nova Scotia; instead they delivered more of the same. To get into office the NDP made promises they could not keep, and they knew they could not keep.</p>
<p>Let's look at the immoral tax on tax. In Opposition the NDP said the tax on tax on gas was an immoral tax and the result was that Nova Scotians were being taxed to death; in government the NDP failed to eliminate the tax they once called immoral and, in fact, they're making more money from the tax on tax because of their HST increase and rising fuel prices. If we look at the issue of increasing the HST, we all remember the debate when the then Leader of the NDP promised that the NDP would balance the budget without increasing taxes - talk about magical thinking. Pretty much everybody understood that was not going to happen, except, I guess, some people who didn't mind if it happened or who actually believed it.</p>
<p>In government the NDP has increased the tax we pay on everything by 2 per cent. It applies to many groceries, gasoline, and many major purchases. In fact that speaks to what this particular business owner was talking about - he said the increase in taxes is hurting his business. He also went on to speak about municipal taxes. There was a decision made here yesterday - or I guess a lack of a decision, because the government did not look at giving a pension holiday to the pension plan for the municipality, and the result is you and I, and every person who lives here in the HRM will pay higher taxes, and the businesses will too, to have to underwrite that solvency requirement that is really quite academic unless we think that in some way HRM is going to go under and pay out all their pensioners at once - it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>During the election campaign the NDP promised that they would keep ERs open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We all know that hasn't happened; we've seen the results. A 2011 government report shows that ERs were closed for 18,920 hours, the equivalent of 788 days in one year under the Dexter Government.</p>
<p>In my own area we are served by the Cobequid centre. Residents there were told the Cobequid Community Health Centre was going to be open 24/7. Well, I can tell you, it is not because I was just there quite recently, at 10:00 p.m., as they were shutting the doors.</p>
<p>When in Opposition the NDP railed against merit pay. They decried the Tory practice of offering merit pay to civil servants while they slashed social spending and they also complained about Tory attempts to hide merit pay facts. In fact, over the last year the NDP paid more than $2 million in merit pay to civil servants while they slashed education and health budgets. They never explained why it was shameful for the Tories to do it but acceptable for them. Like the Tories, they only released the information after a freedom of information request.</p>
<p>Then we look at the IEF. Do you remember back when the then Leader of the Official Opposition, now Premier, was in high outrage against the Industrial Expansion Fund? It's a pot of money that is controlled by Cabinet, without oversight, lending rules or safeguards. The Opposition NDP complained about the Tory use of the IEF and even called it a slush fund. Well, guess what? Here we are after two years of NDP rule, the Dexter Government increased the IEF to more than $260 million, used it more than any other government before them. More than 90 per cent of IEF funds went to NDP ridings and they didn't explain why it was acceptable for them to use the IEF more than any previous government in history. Whoops, looks like we have another broken promise.</p>
<p>Then we'll look at the $1.4 billion deficit. The Dexter Government appointed a committee to examine the province's finances. The committee concluded the province had a $1.4 billion deficit and this deficit was used by the Dexter Government as an excuse to increase everyone's taxes and more than 1,400 user fees.</p>
<p>In 2011 the Dexter Government announced a surplus of more than $700 million. The government appointed a committee to find a deficit that didn't exist and they happily followed along. A $700 million surplus is proof their deficit was fake and that our tax increases were unnecessary.</p>
<p>Then we have whole-tree harvesting. In 2010 the Dexter Government promised to ban whole-tree harvesting, a process that takes the limbs and trunks of trees that are knocked down. This type of forestry makes it harder for the forest to regenerate. You know I remember going on a field trip, I think it was back when I was in Grade 12, and we were told that if you don't leave something in the ground, then you're going to have a problem regenerating.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to a place like Haiti where they have completely denuded parts of their land. You can see it from the air; you can see the delineation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is green from the air; Haiti is brown because they have literally burnt and harvested every single stick of wood in any way, shape or form, and the result is the soil can't hold on to nutrients. You have erosion. You have landslides.</p>
<p>So here we are in 2011 when the Dexter Government announces its Natural Resources Strategy. The strategy didn't follow through on their government's promise to protect our forests by banning whole-tree harvesting. The Dexter NDP has little concern for Nova Scotia's forests.</p>
<p>I have half a minute left. Well, I'll just briefly sum up a couple of other issues. The closed and secretive government that we now have, when they were in Opposition, the NDP complained about Progressive Conservative secrecy and they had issued freedom of information requests after taking office. What we've seen is that Premier Dexter has assembled a group of unelected individuals who have power over his Cabinet. This &#x2026;</p></speech>

Once again, it is an example of a resolution which is taking a very small slice of time in an overarching global trend and suggesting that all of the difficulties which arise in that period of time have risen specifically at the beginning of that time.</p>
<p>I think it is reasonable to say that we are dealing with very significant global forces at this point which indicate that Nova Scotia is like "no man is an island." However, we are working to stabilize the vulnerability which past practices have brought to us in a variety of ways. When this resolution speaks to increasing taxes, gas rates, energy costs, and food costs, it's very interesting that these are the things which are singled out, because all of them are deeply dependent upon matters which are not entirely within the purview of the province.</p>
<p>We have been working to deal with a $1.4 billion debt, and that is a fundamental promise which has been set out to liberate us from almost $44 million of interest payments a year - the simple measures, the small measures which we have been undertaking toward reducing expenditures in some degree, and in others toward increasing the return of public funds to taxpayers.</p>
<p>We have, as promised, ended the year-end spending splurges in which monies which had come into the general coffers were simply disbursed because they were there, for no other reason than to continue to claim territory. This return of money to the general coffers means that it is available to lessen tax demands on the public at large. We have done this very successfully.</p>
<p>At the same time we have raised the personal tax exemption by $250 per person - every person and every taxpayer in Nova Scotia - and have increased the child tax benefit by 22 per cent per child per month. As well, we've instituted a rebate of the HST that brings the amount of HST which would be paid up to that amount which could be expected for somebody at the low-income cut-off level.</p>
<p>We've instituted an Affordable Living Tax Credit and - surprisingly, apparently - we have also lowered the small-business tax rate, so that although we unfortunately hear that small-business owners and taxpayers feel that they are unable to continue business in the province, it is certainly not because of an increased business tax rate. It may perhaps be because of an expectation that minimum wage - which means the delivery, the actual transfer of value from a taxpaying enterprise to the individual citizens - is at an increased level. That, surprisingly enough, also decreases the general tax burden on the province. When people are able to make ends meet, there is less of a demand for the public to help them make ends meet.</p>
<p>Another thing that we're doing - and I'm not going to elaborate on this, because we hear about it a lot in this Chamber - is working to keep young people and working people in this province to increase the tax base from which we can provide the services that government does try to provide and is expected to provide. We're working to create good jobs and to make the best of the educated populace and the resourceful populace that we have. The Graduate Retention Rebate keeps people in the province, as well, and we're working to strengthen our university institutions and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>We've also - and this is a small sideline of this - enabled social assistance recipients to keep more of their earned income. I personally find it very unfortunate that the working poor need to rely on the government for the supplement of their earned income, but at this point that's how it is. Perhaps that's another thing which an adequate minimum wage would help to address, thereby reducing the tax burden on all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>One of the other things which we find ourselves facing, and the other three things which have been mentioned, is all functions of energy costs. It has been noted before in this Chamber that we seem to be at a point of peak oil and have been headed in that direction for a long time. We're aware that there has been a significant loss of local producers of food over the last few years. The hog industry has essentially been - I won't say torpedoed, but lost. We have lost food processors in food and poultry at both ends of the province and it's estimated at this point that the basic, nutritious, weekly food basket would travel about 33,000 kilometres, which is certainly not coming from within Nova Scotia. It also means that a great deal of the outlay that every Nova Scotian has to make for food is actually going to benefit other producers, not within the Nova Scotia catchment area.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that when we talk about inflation, it is defined in two ways. There is core inflation and there is general inflation. General inflation is that which talks about the inflation due to energy prices and certain very, very volatile food items, again tending to be imported ones. Therefore, we are aggressively reinventing Nova Scotia's energy profile. No, at this moment, it is not less expensive than it has been but it should also be noted that the demand for gasoline in the United States has exceeded this year what it has ever come to before; that our energy consumption, at 12,000 gigawatt hours a year, has barely declined over the last few years but it has begun to go down in the last two to three years. We are no longer a top energy consumer and perhaps when we're not a top energy consumer, energy costs are not going to be our top concern.</p>
<p>Lower Churchill is a project which stands to benefit us by making us much less reliable on the volatility of limited energy resources, and our continued investment in the CleanTech Open Fund and in development of tidal energy, which is a resource unsurpassed anywhere in the world, what we have in Nova Scotia, also stands to make us increasingly independent. It's worth looking at the employment profiles of some of the economies which are more dependent on energy production and they, at this point, are peaking whereas those who are involved in renewable are growing in their employment. This is what we talk about when we talk about green jobs.</p>
<p>We're looking at this point to stabilize food prices, gas prices and energy prices. We're also looking to enable households to control their own costs and we are looking to enable the taxes, which are not, in fact, growing in all dimensions, but we're working to enable taxpayers to have access to services closer to home and at a more sustainable and locally delivered level. That is all that we can do for the future because, unfortunately, we are unable to change the past.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4d1fe702-74c5-4f85-8807-4d4ee51c02a2"><from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Madam Speaker, what does a promise mean to the NDP? Well, the Premier said in this House that his government has kept every single commitment it made during the last election. Now, one glaring example is he said that we will balance the budget in the first full year of our government. We know that didn't happen. It still hasn't happened. In fact, the NDP are now saying maybe by 2014 it will happen.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I would submit to you that any Finance Critic worth his salt would have a good understanding of the finances of the province before entering government and would know the state of the province and the government's ability of what they can and can't do in the future.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#4d1fe702-74c5-4f85-8807-4d4ee51c02a2"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Well, the people might have something different to say the next time, especially when they see that promises that were made were not kept by this government.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Premier - and I must delve into the provincial budget a little bit. The NDP increased the provincial portion of the HST by 25 per cent, so if there were any amounts - and I know we looked at the universities, that budget was balanced in 2009, but there was an amount outstanding for universities, and you know even if the NDP had increased the HST alone that would have paid that cost.</p>
<p>We've seen the government play with the full-time equivalents, the number of people working in government, with those numbers to try to show a better picture of things. They had to create a bit of a story because they are claiming they were left with such a mess. We saw them claim a deficit one day and then turn around and claim a surplus the next. We look at the $500 million, half a billion dollars, put into top up the government employees' pension, that's saving the province about a $150 million a year on the budget, money that it doesn't have to put in every year.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, they are doing it all, and if I may quote George Strait: "&#x2026; if you'll buy that I've got some ocean front property in Arizona."</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#4d1fe702-74c5-4f85-8807-4d4ee51c02a2"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>So, Madam Speaker, the Premier, before he was the Premier also promised that the NDP wouldn't raise taxes. On CBC he was saying, "we are not going to raise taxes." But, as we know, of course they raised the HST 25 per cent, and that's one of the biggest sources of income for the province, so it means a significant increase in tax revenue for the government. It comes at a tremendous cost to Nova Scotians; in fact, in the most recent Public Accounts it was learned that the NDP has collected more than $650 in taxes from every person in this province, on average.</p>
<p>They raised taxes under the cover of getting to a balanced budget, yet they had a surplus last year. So, Madam Speaker, can you follow all that? It's difficult and I have no doubt that it makes Nova Scotians pessimistic and confused about the state of the province's finances when we have all these promises before an election, we have all these tales of what a mess we've been left in and then, all of a sudden, the government has to play with the numbers so it doesn't end up with a surplus.</p>
<p>Everybody caught that - the provincial media was questioning that as well when it happened. You can't hide from the numbers and when people like ourselves on this side of the Legislature are taking the government to account on those numbers and there is no response, I think it's obvious that this government has failed to keep to its promises. Madam Speaker, the reason they've added to the tax bill for Nova Scotians is because they've chosen to spend more money. Public Accounts show half a billion more in spending, so the NDP a tax and spend government - who would have known?</p>
<p>We've often heard the government talk about what a mess they've been left in despite the Auditor General confirming that the previous Progressive Conservative Government had left them with eight balanced budgets. The spending numbers, Madam Speaker, say it all. They claim that the Tories were spending too much, yet they voted for those budgets, or at least some of them, to support that expenditure - and I've brought that before the Legislature already and it's right in the public record that they voted for those budgets.</p>
<p>But we also know that they voted against budgets that were designed to bring the province to a balanced budget when John Hamm balanced the budget for the first time in 40 years in 2002-03 - and anybody watching today can go into the records, they can check with our Legislative Library and they will see that the record at that time was that the NDP members voted against those balanced budgets. So it's not really a surprise that the NDP will come to the public and say we're going to balance the budget and then turn around and tax the people more and spend more.</p>
<p>All this, Madam Speaker, we now have a larger deficit and higher taxes, and now we are starting to lose more jobs in the province; in fact, job losses in the province are piling up by the thousands. And when two of the larger employers in the province, Sobeys and Michelin, came to the Law Amendments Committee recently and said we do not want first contract arbitration, it will be harmful for us when we go to encourage more investment in your province - because the people who are running those companies have business in other areas as well. This government said, you're being foolish; this government said, we're going to put it through anyway. They didn't listen.</p>
<p>The reality is that another promise the NDP made is that they were going to create 2,200 jobs a year. That was promised in the 2009 election, and the reality is that Nova Scotia's latest job numbers show a loss of 6,500 jobs in rural Nova Scotia. So those 6,500 workers are Nova Scotians whose families are facing the hardship of a lost job.</p>
<p>The Premier and his Rural and Economic Development and Tourism Minister repeatedly claim that Nova Scotia has gained jobs, but statistics show that that is not the case. On the job creation front, the government has a long way to go to make good on that 2,200 jobs a year promise.</p>
<p>The NDP, the Party that said over and over again to seniors - they said this to seniors, Madam Speaker - that they would make life better for them is making them wait more than 400 days for a long-term care bed in Cape Breton. Their election pamphlet talked about these seniors, and it said, "Too many seniors are forced to travel hundreds of kilometres for care, or left to languish in hospital beds awaiting more appropriate care." I'm going to table that. I'll save that - I have one more point to make on that.</p>
<p>Their election pamphlet said they were going to help seniors and specified it as something they were going to focus on, yet we have seniors waiting for long-term care beds in the province, and 400 days is a long time to wait. The wait list actually is growing longer than it was before this government was elected. They are spending more, but obviously not to help these people in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The NDP's review of auto insurance rates was promised, to ensure the lowest, fairest rates. After all their bluster in Opposition, they chose to keep the cap, albeit raised by a small amount in real terms. They also accepted recommendations that I know I had made myself on this side of the House, about taking a look at the diagnostic and treatment protocols in Alberta, and we were happy to see that the government put those into place.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there is one big promise that the NDP are breaking every day, and that is that they are making life better for today's families. I have to look at the debt because I'm going to table the - one of the things the NDP had said is, "The NDP is committed to ensuring that Nova Scotia lives within its means." They also said that - the print is small here, but essentially they're saying that they were going to live within their means. They talked about how the current government was adding a lot of debt.</p>
<p>One point of information that I have tabled in this Legislature, and it has never been refuted, is that this NDP Government has added more debt to our province than any other political Party in our 250-plus year history. That was tabled right here in the Legislature. We can look and the Finance Minister can look at the debt the day he took government and the debt we have now and the amount of debt that the NDP - it's been tabled and you have never refuted it. Maybe it's time you refute it, but I don't think you can and that's why you haven't.</p></speech>

            <p>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I do apologize for breaking protocol there. At the end of the day this government is not making life better for today's families. They are making life more expensive for Nova Scotians.

          <speech by="#cfb3bc32-2d05-41ad-a115-6bddf2118033"><from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's interesting to have to talk about this issue again - the broken promises by the Premier of the NDP Government and the NDP caucus and Resolution No. 2886. I'd just like to go through a few of the things that people have been talking to me about and people are starting to realize exactly what this government has done to the average person. During the election campaign it talked about a better deal for Nova Scotia families. The better deal, I think, has totally crumbled and dashed all the hopes of many Nova Scotians and indeed, as time goes on, most all Nova Scotians will be affected by this, although they may not be aware of it at the present time.</p>
<p>I'm going to go through some of the things here that the government has changed. They said that they wouldn't raise taxes and indeed they have raised taxes in many places; more costs for Nova Scotians, costs that they can't afford. An average family today with two people working and a couple of children, making a modest income, simply can't make it anymore and they're starting to wonder why. They go to the grocery store and the groceries are more expensive; they go to the gas station and the gas is more expensive; however they heat their home is more expensive, whether it is oil, electricity or any other form of heat, it's more expensive; and it's thanks to this government, it truly is.</p>
<p>When they increased the GST by two cents, that's 25 per cent on the provincial portion of the GST, it is a significant increase in one year. Of course, that's a significant increase because it's on everything and it's after tax money that people are spending, so it's a huge increase in taxes in just that one swipe. In addition to that we have bracket creep in this province and most people don't know what bracket creep is, it is income tax that goes up every year. So your income tax has gone up every year, your GST has gone up and so have 1,400 user fees. Everybody in this province, at one time or another, pays a user fee, whether it's your driver's licence, your vehicle registration, death certificate, a marriage or birth certificate, anything that we need to have documentation for, fees have been increased. On utility trailers it has gone up twice in one month, twice the cost.</p>
<p>When I asked the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations, during the Budget Debate some time ago, he finally admitted - and he's an honest man - that the Finance Minister told him to put taxes up, put the price up. I was enquiring to see exactly why this tax had to go on because it was cost increases, cost increases, but indeed we did find out that in reality it was a tax increase imposed by the government, a tax increase that was done outside this Chamber. The very Finance Minister who sits over on the NDP benches said, it should not be done unless it was done in this House. Well, it was done outside the House and breaking every rule they possibly could.</p>
<p>The NDP wonders why their gross domestic product in Nova Scotia has been so bad - the 1.9 per cent - the worst in provincial governments in this whole country. If you look why, you can't put taxes up and put more burden on businesses and people as you move forward and wonder why the people don't want to work here and businesses don't want to operate here. Well, it's easy to figure out.</p>
<p>When you look at the costs that go for business - and businesses employ people and people pay income tax if they're employed. Don't employ them and they stay in the province, it's a burden on the taxpayers who are working, so it's a vicious circle that's stated here. On top of that the memorandum of understanding that the province had made an arrangement with the previous government to take over some of the costs of corrections and housing and some of the other services that Education and the municipalities have been paying for directly to the province, they changed that; this government cancelled it and they cancelled that MOU.</p>
<p>When they cancelled that MOU it meant that the municipalities had to go back to their taxpayers and put property taxes up to pay for this. So if you're wondering why your property tax has gone up, one of the reasons is this MOU that was cancelled by this NDP Government. It's just another way of putting your taxes up without having to take credit for putting your taxes up, just download it on the municipalities and the municipalities will just move along, put the taxes up and we'll be clear of that increase. It is another way that the Finance Minister can get away with saying, we didn't really put taxes up, your property taxes, but, indeed, they did and benefited from the result of that property tax going up, although it being in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>I forgot for a long time, as soon as they got in power, they put up the price of alcohol and tobacco. That's another tax increase and that was done outside the budget, or I should say inside the budget during the House sitting.</p>
<p>The cost of food in this province has gone up. Why has it gone up? The GST has gone up and fuel costs have gone up. It was $1 a litre for gasoline when this government took power. I think it's $1.23 today. (Interruption) $1.29 today for fuel? That's almost 30 cents more per litre. When you talk about the economy and we're going to compete with the economies outside of here, the reality is if you're going to make the economy grow in Nova Scotia, you have to bring money into the province from other provinces, from other countries, wherever the place may be, and if you don't do that, you recirculate money, and when you recirculate, you can only recirculate it so many times and it's ineffective after that. It really adds nothing to the economy, but if you're going to the U.S., which is our nearest neighbour, one of our biggest trading partners, gasoline right now is running about 82 cents to 84 cents a litre.</p>
<p>Now, just put that in perspective. We're paying $1.29 and our neighbours in Maine, in New England, and the rest of the U.S., are paying between 82 cents and 84 cents a litre. So where is it more competitive for business to work? In the U.S. and that's bad news for us because we have to export to the U.S. The cost of diesel is very similar. The cost of home heating is very similar and, indeed, we cannot compete with companies in the U.S. that are hungry for work, hungry for business, and really want to do things to make their economies better. If they can displace something we're shipping in from Canada, it means we lose jobs in Canada. We lose jobs in Canada because of that. We lose jobs in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>So as the economy moves along and everything looks like it's okay, it's really not. We've got approximately 12,500 jobs that have been lost in this province and then the government comes along with the Ships Start Here Program. There are going to be 11,000 new jobs. When Mr. Irving was interviewed on the radio station here shortly after they announced that, he said, no, it's really going to be 1,200 new jobs and, indeed, 300 of those jobs are only going to be for a short time when we build a new hanger, or new facility, to build these ships in. Once that facility is done, which will take about two years to two and a half years, 300 jobs out of the 1,200 will be gone anyway. So we are down to 900 jobs. We presently have 1,000 jobs here now.</p>
<p>This shipbuilding contract isn't going to save this province. It's a big help and I want to congratulate the Irving company for their aggressive approach on this and, indeed, got the right to negotiate to contract - that's a right to negotiate the contract, that isn't the contract awarded. Those are two different things, and then after it's negotiated - and hopefully they will get the contact, if the government doesn't change its mind, which they could very well do. You can see they're making serious cuts and transfers to health care. They're making serious cuts in federal departments. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans announced some major cuts in the staff and the list is going to go on and on. Are they going to cut the military spending and say, look, we're not going to buy as many ships; we're not going to have as many ships built. What's really going to happen?</p>
<p>So this whole deal that the Premier decides he's going to take all the credit for, even though it was very little to do with the province and more to do with the company's proposal, that it's going to save the province, it's not, it's really not. We have fewer and fewer people looking for work in this province, down, I believe it's 14,000 people who stopped looking for work in the province, stopped, and if you take the 12,500 who have lost their jobs, that's 26,500 people in this province. That's a huge number.</p>
<p>I believe that it's all attributed to, or most of it's attributed to, the tax increases, all the other things in this province that have been in place. I haven't talked about power bills in this province. The power is going to go up approximately 10 per cent in just a few months now, when it comes into January. That's a huge increase for Nova Scotians to absorb. With all these things, all these broken promises by this government, I can't see how the people of this province can possibly re-elect many of the members who are over there now. They will see, when they knock on the doors next election, that indeed they're going to hear the story, you know, I can't afford to vote for you anymore because you put our taxes up so much and we can't believe what you're going to tell us at the next election because you didn't keep your promises the last time.</p>
<p>So it's going to be interesting when the next election comes along to see how the NDP make out. Hopefully for Nova Scotia's economy and future, they lose the next election.</p></speech>

<p>"Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House of Assembly urge the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism to start including hard economic targets and measurable outcomes in his strategy, and get the people of Cape Breton back to work."</p>
<p>As most of the 51 members, my colleagues, would attest, this is one that is near and dear to me in terms of where we are going with our economic development in the province and what our plan is. What I've been saying is - and I know that there are lots of people on the government side and all sides of the House who understand business and understand the road map to getting revenue and getting profits.</p>
<p>I have a sheet here, which I'll table, which is essentially the bones of a business plan. If you look at what a standard business plan includes, you'll see that having targets and having economic data, hard economic data, in terms of how you are going to create jobs and make money is important. The business overview includes things like the nature of the industry, trends in an industry, government regulations, market trends, all those types of things. Another key component, clearly, is human resources, so that is a major component of a business plan: where are your people? That's your jobs that we're talking about. They're the targets.</p>
<p>The most important part, as far as I'm concerned, is the appendix, which is the financials that go to a business plan - financial performance, historical and projected, sales, cost of goods sold. If you're talking about sales, you're talking about the cost of goods sold. That significantly and directly represents how many jobs you have, how many jobs you're going to create, if you're expanding or if you're a start-up. Balance sheet, cash flow statement, financial requirements, performance indicators, and personnel status - so I will table that information as part of the business plan.</p>
<p>During one of the debates this week, I believe it was the Minister of Community Services who mentioned what I talked about a couple of seconds ago, with respect to the government side having people who understand business and may have been entrepreneurs or worked in small business or a medium-size enterprise, what have you. But the comment - paraphrasing - was that there are lots of good people on the government side. To those people who understand business and have a feel for the way these things work, I'll ask you a question: how many entrepreneurs do you know who went to a bank or the Credit Union for a loan and didn't have a business plan, who actually got money and had some kind of plan for how they're going to make their profits? I would suspect not many.</p>
<p>How many expanding businesses get money without this kind of data? When you walk into the Royal Bank or one of the commercial banks or any lending organization, who's getting money if you don't have that information? If you're a large company and you're looking for venture capital, what kind of venture capitalist, what kind of organization, would give you money if you didn't have financials, if you didn't have an HR plan to show where you're going, where you're expanding, what those numbers are going to look like?</p>
<p>Numbers represent a lot of things when you're talking about business and economic development. They show growth potential, they show whether or not you're going to survive, and they also are an indicator of performance. The numbers, the financials you have - your sales, your cost of goods sold, all of these things, whether it's a product or a service - they indicate your performance. Those performance indicators show what your human resources are going to look like, so I don't understand. If it's an expansion - if it's one to two people, if it's 10 to 20, if it's 500 to 700 - you don't pick a number out of the air.</p>
<p>I listened to the minister's comments about this and I listened to the department. They presented at committee, and they're great people - very forthcoming with the information, answered it honestly, and it was good information for all of us who were involved. But the reality is - and the response that we got in committee was similar to that of the minister. It was, we don't want to use a number because we don't want to create a ceiling, or we don't want to use a number because we don't want to harness ourselves, or we don't want to use a number because then if you don't meet that number, if you fall short by a few, then that becomes the conversation and that becomes the dialogue.</p>
<p>Again, I think that many who have looked at business and who get a feel for business - it would be interesting to hear the Minister of Finance's perspective about this in terms of how you make money and how you establish these targets. For me, and this is obviously my perspective, you don't just pick a number and then work backwards and figure out how to meet that number; that's not the exercise here. You do your research, your department and those economic development drivers do their research, and they look at industries and they look at companies and they look at what our growth sectors are, then you look at the core competencies. What are our core skills in Nova Scotia?</p>
<p>Is it manufacturing, tourism, geographic location - is that our strategy? What kind of things will we use to attract business and grow business and support business? Then you match the opportunities with those investment options that you have at your fingertips. That's how we do this. We look at the sectors. We look at what players we can attract or what sectors are going to expand. It doesn't always have to be a new business, although new money coming in from the province, from outside, certainly adds a lot to our GDP which grows our economy.</p>
<p>Those prospective players that will come in or those that will expand, they create job targets. They know where their human resources are and they know what they're going to need. That's where you get your number. You don't pick it and then shoot for it. It results from the homework that you do developing your economic development strategies. We're talking about $400 million, which is a sizable investment. The conversations, whether it's the IEF, which at the time, during the Economic Development Committee, was going to be the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund - whatever it's called, it's been identified, labelled as a political slush fund and the specific response of how this money is targeted, or whether or not it's targeted, there's a certain portion of it that's used for reactionary purposes. There's something we need so it has to be addressed.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, that looks a lot like a political slush fund. If there are no targets and there are no strings attached, then I'm not sure what else it is. This, again, predates the current government but it's a problem, and I said this in my remarks with respect to the Jobs Fund, and I believe it. I truly do. We need hard targets and we have to figure out where this money's being spent because it's the taxpayers' money and with all due respect, I think that using the business community and the business experts we have - and we have lots of them in Nova Scotia, no question - that's our best bet.</p>
<p>I don't know if our best bet is to be spending these kinds of dollars with the decisions of politicians. It's the business people who make this thing drive and they're all important in our ridings and our respective regions, so I think they're the people we should be listening to.</p>
<p>We have talked about targets and Bowater has a target. The Premier used the number of 2,000. Irving has a number, has a target - 12,000 give or take. They're numbers, they're jobs; they're what we're looking at. NewPage, of course, when that time comes, will have targets. That's what we use; that's the yardstick that we use and I think that for our public dollar investment, that's what we should be looking at.</p>
<p>The NDP Government had targets as well. They talked about the 2,200 jobs per year and that was in their platform that the member for Inverness read earlier. I do have it here and I can certainly table it, but I think we're all aware of it now - 2,200 jobs per year is a target. So where did that number come from? I wouldn't suspect that the government side, while running in the 2009 provincial election, made these numbers up out of the air. I would suspect there was some kind of thought put into it and they developed based on - it's about a tax credit, so, was that a specific industry? Was that industry specific? What did that 10 per cent tax credit mean and how would that create 2,200 new jobs? That's the question that I have. They are targets, believe it or not.</p>
<p>One minute left. I just want to quickly say that $400 million - these are dire times and again, it's a majority government. The government certainly does have the tools, the policies, the control of the government engine to make these decisions. We can look at all the numbers and we can look at the employment figures that we think are important, the government can do likewise, but at the end of the day, there are very specific figures that I like to use that indicate our performance - 1.9 per cent growth is the lowest of any province, second in the country, second lowest to the Northwest Territories. That's a very definitive number. That's the one where all of these things that we discuss, all the things that we talk about are connected to that.</p>
<p>Again, for Cape Breton, for all regions of the province, what we need is very specific job targets and we've got to get there with the public knowledge. With that, Madam Speaker, thank you and I'll take my seat.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#98fd525a-b480-446d-8a4d-f002d18eb5c0"><from>MR. JIM BOUDREAU</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is my pleasure to rise today to speak about the investments our NDP Government has made to grow the economy of Cape Breton. My constituency of Guysborough-Sheet Harbour borders the Canso Causeway, which is the gateway to the island. We share a border, if you will, and we also share many of the same goals and aspirations.</p>
<p>Since forming government in 2009 the NDP have focused on not only the creation of jobs but the creation of good jobs, ones that will allow Nova Scotians to work hard and make ends meet, while contributing to our provincial economy.</p>
<p>Let's talk for a moment, Madam Speaker, about investments in transportation and infrastructure. In 2009 we saw, firsthand, the toll years of neglect of roads and highways were having on the safety of Nova Scotians. The Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal had the full support of our government to begin strategically planning for paving, spending the time and spreading the asphalt needed to ensure safety for the road users and their families.</p>
<p>I am pleased, Madam Speaker, to be able to share with this House and to recap for Cape Bretoners who may be watching today, some of the highlights of the road and paving investments that have created jobs in Cape Breton. Upgrades on Highway No. 104 in Richmond have smoothed the drive for local commuters and travellers. This was long overdue and the responsible thing to do.</p>
<p>The famous Cabot Trail has received much-needed attention. Highway No. 105 and the Big Baddeck Road, the Buchanan Bridge, Route 255 and the bridge over MacAskills Brook, Highway 125 near Sydney are much safer. Route 237, Kenwood Drive and Alexander Street received a much-needed roundabout to safely funnel traffic and a retrofit to Sydney River Bridge will help folks in Coxheath and Sydney River to drive with ease.</p>
<p>Our government did not stop at roads and highways. We realize that many community organizations create good jobs and investments in their infrastructure allow them to thrive. I am pleased to remind the honourable members of just a few organizations in Cape Breton that have received investments that either created jobs directly or will enable growth in the future. Building a new storage facility and a new three-ice sheet building at the Strait area community curling club, put Cape Bretoners to work. I was very pleased to represent our government at this ceremony marking this accomplishment.</p>
<p>A new, multi-use, outdoor fitness facility for St. Peter's Lions Club will provide more jobs for people in this area of the island. Renovations to the Strait Regional School Board's Felix Marchand Education Centre and SAERC will also create many hours of employment.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, investments in roads and buildings are only part of the way our government has created jobs in Cape Breton. We've invested in water treatment and sewage treatment for Arichat, Petit-du-Grat and we've also put money in the Richmond arena in Louisdale. These will add hours on the paycheques of Cape Bretoners.</p>
<p>More waste water upgrades and improvements to Main Street in Louisbourg, the Louisbourg Lighthouse Trail and the Louisbourg Old Town Trail, all contribute to enhance the capacity for this picturesque community to attract tourists and therefore, create more sustainable jobs in this important community.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, creating investments in St. Anne's Elementary, Oceanview Education Centre, Whitney Pier Day Care Centre, Cusack-Cornwallis-Ashby Complex, Ferrisview Elementary School and Playschool Day Care Centre all contribute to a growing economy on Cape Breton Island.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I would be remiss not to mention the significant investment made in the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotian Railway, which will preserve an important part of Cape Breton's infrastructure, securing current and future jobs in Cape Breton. I have to point out how disappointed I was, and our government was, when the Leader of the Third Party spoke out against these jobs in Cape Breton. I would like to table this article from the Halifax ChronicleHerald in which the Leader of the Progressive Conservatives questions an investment in infrastructure that has been in place for generations - and, I might add, crosses several areas, including PC constituencies. I also noticed in the newspaper article that the Leader of the Third Party goes on to question the need for a minimum wage - but, Madam Speaker, I digress.</p>
<p>It's simply too bad that the leader of the Third Party couldn't support this investment, like CBRM Mayor John Morgan did. I would like to table this letter from Mayor John Morgan, thanking Premier Dexter and our government for recognizing the importance of this long-standing infrastructure in Cape Breton. It is good to know that Mayor Morgan understands the importance of jobs in Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Like the important investment in CB Rail, support for the YMCA of Cape Breton to grow and expand its community-based programming and services will help employees and community members alike, helping them to sustain their very own successful businesses through a strategic investment that will allow Techlink Entertainment to expand its market and its array of products and services. Of course, the remediation of the tar ponds and coke oven sites into outdoor common areas and boardwalks will create jobs from the current concept stage right through to the laying of concrete and later maintenance of the area.</p>
<p>The items I have discussed today - and I've only touched on a few - are only a few in a much larger list of job-creation initiatives. What all MLAs in this House and all Cape Bretoners should be able to surmise from my brief account of Cape Breton job-creation investments is that this NDP Government is about making life better for families in all regions of the province, Cape Breton firmly included. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#0592f881-721c-495f-a273-d237278fabfc"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Madam Speaker, I stand here and listen to some of the so-called trophies for the NDP Government on the other side that were initially started by Opposition governments. He talks about the Central Nova Scotia Railway that the member who preceded me in Cape Breton North fought so hard to keep. He talks about the Sydney tar ponds. If he could find his way to the tar ponds, he'd realize that that tar ponds project was started years and years before this NDP Government was in power. It was under a Tory Government and it's federally-provincially sponsored, so to quit that would be suicide for people in Cape Breton.</p>
<p>The government is failing rural Nova Scotia and it's failing Cape Bretoners in all aspects of economic development and tourism. The minister can stand here and table statements that were read in the paper, but if you read the rest of those statements, I believe it's in the hopes that Cape Breton will get a few of the economic crumbs from the world-class event that is going to be here in Halifax.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months since I've been elected, I have spoken to Destination Cape Breton personnel. They have asked time and time again for help to promote Cape Breton, to help promote it directly, not hope to get a few spin-offs. Maybe the rest of the province could get a few spinoffs from what Cape Breton has to offer, by bringing people into Cape Breton, and maybe the rest of them would then visit the rest of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we have golf courses, we have beautiful land and seascapes, we have national parks, and we had a train, we just kept it. We have some of the most friendly people in the world and we have the Gateway to Newfoundland.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#0592f881-721c-495f-a273-d237278fabfc"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Yes, I forgot, they developed that.</p>
<p>We should take that and use it to our advantage so maybe we could get some of the people from Newfoundland and Labrador to stay here in Cape Breton. We don't have a proper tourist bureau in North Sydney. We have an old baby barn type of structure with two people who sit in there. I don't know how they can even fit in there. This year they were even going to cancel that, until some of the local politicians - and I believe Mayor Morgan might have been one of them - but I know that the local politicians in my area and myself had to go and get that restored. That tourist area is not easily accessible to any tourists coming off the Newfoundland and Labrador ferry or going to the Newfoundland and Labrador ferry.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, job losses continue to increase under this NDP Government and they are ignoring that there's a crisis and it's costing families jobs. They would like to just talk about their jobsHere program with no specific targets or goals. We've been told just to sit back, get out of their way, and let them go. But that's not our job. Our job as Opposition MLAs is to make sure taxpayers' dollars are spent in the best possible way to improve life in Nova Scotia and economic growth in this province, especially Cape Breton. But this is not what we've seen since this NDP has taken office. We have over 15 per cent unemployment in Cape Breton - not something that those 15 per cent and the rest of Cape Breton are proud of - and we do believe there is a crisis in rural Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Premier and the Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Minister should be ashamed of themselves. They owe families an explanation why they are not standing up for communities in crisis, why they are not listening to Nova Scotians, especially on bills like Bill No. 102, and why they're not worried about a job crisis in rural Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Cape Breton is down over 1,300 jobs in the last year. They haven't made investments in infrastructures like the Keltic Lodge, which they said in a statement back in the Spring that if the lodge didn't have its upgrades we would lose our trademark, we could lose our branding of these resorts. We've been waiting two years now and it's not in the new plan and, like I say, Cape Breton is down over 1,300 jobs over the last year - and this was before the NDP pushed new job-killing labour legislation through this Legislature. Job creators say that this legislation will do just the exact opposite, that it will kill jobs in Nova Scotia and decrease the investment here.</p>
<p>Month over month and year over year Cape Breton is bleeding jobs and the NDP are continuing to sit on their hands about it - the Premier is even going so far as to deny that there is a crisis in rural Nova Scotia, despite evidence to the contrary. Madam Speaker, on November 22<sup>nd</sup> when asked by reporters in Halifax about his thoughts about a crisis in rural Nova Scotia, the Premier said, "I disagree that there is a crisis." I asked the same question in Question Period to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism and he agreed with the Premier. But the NDP federal leadership candidate, Paul Dewar, spoke to the contrary. So that tells me that this government is just out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>The people of rural Nova Scotia have to live with this reality every day. Cape Breton has seen nothing but job losses under this NDP Government. The businesses that have been harmed by the high tax, high power rate policies of this government are now saying, pretty much unanimously, that the government's new labour laws will hurt this economy, kicking them when they're down, not helping them to remain viable and to improve the business environment, and help them operate in Nova Scotia the way they should be, helping them back on their feet.</p>
<p>That's what our government should be doing and that's what they should be doing to help the business sector - but they are not and they continue to ignore this. This hurts areas like Cape Breton and it will hurt all areas of rural Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia there are 13,000 call centre jobs. In Cape Breton, where jobs are scarce, they provide skilled labour opportunities in communities that are better off for their presence. Minacs in Port Hawkesbury and Stream and EDS in industrial Cape Breton are just a couple of examples. We saw what the loss of a call centre job in New Waterford did to that community - 350 jobs gone; 350 people will not be paying taxes to the province, will not be spending local this Christmas and putting back into our economy to help it grow.</p>
<p>We asked the NDP Government, especially the members for Antigonish, Guysborough-Sheet Harbour, and Cape Breton Centre, why push Bill No. 102, and why now? Why job-killing legislation when nobody asked for it? There was no labour unrest that exists at the present. Why, when so much was at stake, when our province's economy is so fragile and nobody in the business community asked for it or approves of it? It's quite the economic math, Madam Speaker, the NDP are pursuing in rural Nova Scotia - threatening existing jobs, bringing in policies that drive away existing jobs, and replacing them with no jobs.</p>
<p>When in Opposition, the member for Cape Breton Centre said, it's "&#x2026; not the type of industry you're going to build your economy around &#x2026;" and that people don't aspire to be call centre workers. That was in the Daily News. Well, the 350 people laid off in New Waterford and the thousands employed in nearby call centres are still waiting for the member for Cape Breton Centre to show us exactly what he and the NDP will do to build the economy.</p>
<p>If there was ever an industry that was globally competitive, it's the call centre industry. There are 13,000 employees and the sector plays an important role in our economy, with close to $0.5 billion in direct payroll contributions. Many young people get their start in a contact centre job, and they are a key part of keeping families in our region. For many families they are a second income, and for some they are a sole income. The contact centre industry is a modern service industry that is comprised of global companies that can easily move their labour to jurisdictions that are more competitive.</p>
<p>In the Committee on Law Amendments we heard that one call centre, a Fortune 500 company, has 80,000 contact centre workers globally and only 300 of them are here in Nova Scotia. In the past the NDP haven't had good things to say about call centres. One minute they say it's a mug's game, as stated in the Daily News back in 2000; the next minute they say they're hard to replace.</p>
<p>What's the NDP doing about it? Apparently nothing. Rural Nova Scotia is down 6,500 jobs over the past year. Not only is the NDP failing to bring higher-paying, more skilled jobs to Cape Breton, now they're actively engaged in lawmaking to risk the jobs that are already there. Bill No. 102 was said to bring that to the business community. We heard it over and over in the Committee on Law Amendments and we've heard it in our office since it has been introduced. That's not economic development. It's economic destruction.</p>
<p>The government side says the legislation is not a big deal, but that's not what we heard from people who presented at the Committee on Law Amendments or businesses in my community. I know it's the same as businesses in the communities here. They say that this legislation has the risk of a third party coming in and dictating how to run their business. Those job creators don't want to see that, because they don't know the business that could be coming in to dictate to.</p>
<p>It's almost as if they disagree with the presenters who outlined how it could hinder the future investments here. Businesses say if they're not competitive, they run the risk of shedding jobs that will never come back - jobs that we badly need in rural Nova Scotia. Every single job in rural Nova Scotia is valuable.</p>
<p>Under Bill No. 102, first contracts will be arbitrated and management now assumes the risk of a successful organizing campaign. It takes away any semblance of an equal bargaining position for a first contract. Labour-intensive industries like the contact centre sector, if faced with higher costs, will simply move - pack up and go where the business climate is better for them to operate in.</p>
<p>In closing, massive job losses and double-digit unemployment are failing to sway this Premier, as are the businesses that came forward and the thousands of people in Nova Scotia who spoke to us about this industry. He has continued to deny that there is a crisis mounting in Cape Breton, even though 1,300 jobs have been lost in the last year alone. Families in Cape Breton are finding it more and more difficult as time passes. Time is not on our side. The economy is faltering because of the NDP's job-killing policies.</p>
<p>The vast number of layoffs and closures that have been piling up lately don't add up to a crisis? That's not what we hear in Cape Breton. We know there's a crisis. We live with it daily, and Cape Breton is continuing to suffer. We'd like to see that change. Thank you.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Cape Breton South.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#634a3222-6546-4aa7-ae2f-9f541e6d1f6c"><from>HON. MANNING MACDONALD</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'd like to offer a few comments on Resolution No. 2778. I'll start by saying that this discussion today is a reality check on what is really happening in Cape Breton, and that's why the resolution is here: 15.7 per cent unemployment in Cape Breton is simply not acceptable. It's half that unemployment rate in Halifax. Cape Breton, the last time I looked, was still a part of Nova Scotia, and should be treated equally as all other areas of rural Nova Scotia should be treated.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, our biggest industry in Cape Breton now is the export industry. We're exporting people to Fort McMurray on a daily basis. Men and women are going out there to work, which is causing a lot of stress on families in our area. The only thing good about it is that there is income generated out West that is making its way back to Cape Breton, and that certainly is helpful.</p>
<p>The other interesting fact about my area, the area that I represent and all the areas surrounding that, is that the two biggest employers there are public sector employees, Cape Breton University and the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, both of which employ a tremendous amount of Cape Bretoners in both of those fields, health and education. I shudder to think where we would be in Cape Breton with our economy if we didn't have the regional hospital within our midst with the satellite operations in Glace Bay, New Waterford and North Sydney.</p>
<p>Also, the Cape Breton University has made giant strides in its educational programs over the past number of years. Something that we supported very vigorously was the inclusion of the Bachelor of Education program for that university. There are a number of students coming into that university from outside, creating to the economy, but that's the public sector economy.</p>
<p>There are a couple of issues in my area and the areas of the other members from Cape Breton that are of grave concern to us and one is that we'd like see an early resolution to the Donkin mine situation; we'd like to see that mine open as quickly as possible and I would hope that the government would stop talking about the evils of coal in Cape Breton and start helping us to develop that particular industry, which in effect would take the place of importing coal for the generating stations.</p>
<p>It's absolutely ridiculous, Madam Speaker, when the government can sit back and rail on about fossil fuels on a number of occasions and yet it's no problem for them to import coal from the States, Venezuela, and everywhere else, and we have coal sitting in Cape Breton that could be adapted to meet the necessary environmental concerns that anybody would have.</p>
<p>The other issue is the harbour dredging, and while that's a great project for our area, it's only half the puzzle here. The other half of that puzzle is to attract a book of business to Sydney Harbour and that's going to require the Laurentian Group and other business people in the area who want to see that project go forward. That's going to require the provincial and federal governments to help those people out in trying to attract a book of business to that harbour. It's no good for this government and the federal government to invest money in dredging the harbour and then walk away from it. They have to be actively helping us to pursue business for Sydney Harbour once this harbour dredging is completed.</p>
<p>I know that there are going to be people who are saying, you know, you're going to be competing against other entities in this province and on the East Coast of Canada, but let me tell you that I think in this particular case the best proposals should get the business. In Cape Breton we have the lay-down area in Point Edward. We have the rails system down there. We have the harbour that will be dredged shortly. We have all the ingredients there to accept post-Panamax vessels into our harbour and the resulting business that will come from shipping from Sydney to other parts throughout the world.</p>
<p>The other issue that I talk about every chance I get is the need to develop the so-called icons - and they are icons in Cape Breton - such as Fort Louisbourg, the Bell Museum, the Cabot Trail, Marconi, all of these are left to, basically, our own devices to try to promote in Cape Breton when this provincial Department of Tourism, this minister who keeps talking about his job strategy, should be meeting with Cape Breton people about developing and improving these entities in Cape Breton such as Fort Louisbourg.</p>
<p>I've said it time and time again that we should be developing a business model for Louisbourg. We should be developing a business model that works for the Bell Museum, the Marconi exhibits, and also the entire Cabot Trail area. But that takes more than Cape Breton tourism can do on their own. It should involve the leadership of this minister and his department to develop those very necessary tourism potentials for our island.</p>
<p>I'll say, Madam Speaker, in my area we have a tremendous number of people who are interested in seeing the island improve, to see the island grow. I said it in the House the other day and I'll say it again, I give credit where credit is due and the equity tax credit that the Minister of Finance has proposed should help people to invest in our community. I just hope there are a few of them left there to do the investing.</p>
<p>As I say, we have great entrepreneurs and people who could go anywhere else in this world and make their fortune, yet they choose to stay in Cape Breton; they choose to invest their money in Cape Breton and all they need is for people to realize that and to assist this part of Nova Scotia in growing. The promotion of our area through channels like Tourism Nova Scotia is very important, the promotion of our area from the federal and provincial governments in trying to attract a book of business into Sydney Harbour once it is dredged - and people will say that there's a lot of money gone with the dredging. Sure there is, and I said that's only half the puzzle. What we have to do when we have an enabling harbour to accept these big vessels, we need to have a reason to have them come into Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>I would hope that the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism and the Premier's Office and the federal government would all step up to the plate here and help Cape Breton develop the Port of Sydney in the future, as a result of step number one, which was the dredging.</p>
<p>The other thing that I talked about a lot, I guess, over the past few years, is the need to relocate provincial government jobs into Cape Breton. It has been talked about for years and if there's one area of this province that needs less government intervention than any other area, it's the Halifax area. Halifax has a vibrant economy and is growing. I'd be the first to say that if you have a strong capital area then it should reflect itself in the rest of the province.</p>
<p>However, that's not happening here because we're not getting our share of provincial dollars spent in Cape Breton, nor are we getting our share in terms of some federal initiatives to come into Cape Breton, although we've had some. Wherever somebody will listen to me I am always talking about moving Coast Guard ships into Sydney Harbour; talking about moving, perhaps, the Department of National Defence, now known again, thankfully, as the Royal Canadian Navy, to move some of their vessels into Sydney because it creates a tremendous amount of local infrastructure and spending of money from the services needed to service Coast Guard vessels or vessels from the Royal Canadian Navy.</p>
<p>Now that takes a great deal of political will, and I would hope that someday somebody will see the strength in some of the - particularly the Coast Guard. I think perhaps there is more of a chance to get the Coast Guard because the Coast Guard can operate very effectively out of Sydney in the wintertime, when they're needed. We see them in there once in a while but they're not based there and I would suspect, or suggest to you, that if we had one or two of them based there it would make a heck of a difference in our economy because the infrastructure to support them is there with the Army base in the north end of Sydney and the old Point Edward Naval Base, which is now run by the Laurentian Group.</p>
<p>So there are a number of ways which the public sector can help our economy in Cape Breton. There's also, Madam Speaker, a number of ways which the private sector can be helped to promote our area in the future. I suggest - and I'll wind up by saying this - that the Department of Tourism has to take a serious look at the kind of icons we have in Cape Breton and engage in a promotion of those particular icons so that we can at least come to a position where we can compete with other areas of Nova Scotia, in terms of attracting tourists to our area.</p>
<p>I would hope that the government would keep those suggestions in mind when they're developing future strategies for Nova Scotia. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.</p>

          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I do wish to speak briefly to the bill. I already hear calls for the question and so I will try to be concise in my remarks. I did just want to, first of all, take a moment and review how we got to this point, to this specific bill today.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it was the Speaker's Office earlier this year that created the independent commission, the independent panel that reviewed the plan in question, and I did want to point out that that is very much in line with my own thinking about how these things ought to be done - by an independent panel. I know that that is what the Speaker went and did, and I just want to acknowledge that that's how we started down this road.</p>
<p>Secondly, Madam Speaker, I will draw the attention of members to the bill and the fact that the government has chosen to follow, by and large, the results of that independent panel, the Gruchy report - if I can refer to it that way, in shorthand. But it did deviate in one way and that is it removed the provision, which I think surprised some people, that the eligibility for a pension for a member, that that member become eligible within two years.</p>
<p>I would like to think that that was in part because in the PC caucus we very quickly, on the very day that the panel report was presented to the House and to all members of the public and others, that we were clear that that was a provision that we couldn't support. Months went by before the government and for all Parties were able to then speak to an actual bill, but that two-year provision was removed and the government saw fit to remove it. For whatever reason they did that, I would just like to say I would like to think that we had some hand in causing that to happen, and I'm pleased that it is out.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the government of course is not perfect in this case, and I might as well say it. The Gruchy report also had another recommendation that has not been followed in the case of this bill and that is that it was suggested that the government consider setting up a separate set of accounts for the members' retirement plan, and the government has seen fit not to do that. I personally am disappointed that the government hasn't followed up on that part of the Gruchy report.</p>
<p>After all, Madam Speaker, it is good pension governance practice to have a separate set of accounts for pension plans and this one should be no different. The objective of having a separate set of accounts are ones that seem to me to be worthy of support and that is it increases the transparency around the asset and liability position of the plan, so that all of those who made contribution to the plan - which by the way is not only MLAs but also the government itself, or taxpayers through the government - that all those who make contributions to the plan will know that it's in a segregated account and can know with certainty and clarity and full transparency how much a member of the plan puts in and how much the taxpayer puts in.</p>
<p>In fact it's the most clear way to do it and I guess I am surprised that that's not in the bill. I remain hopeful that the government will follow up on that part of the Gruchy report and give to all Nova Scotians a separate set of accounts, fully accountable, fully transparent, so that Nova Scotia can see not only what the MLAs are contributing but what they themselves are being asked to contribute, and whether those contributions are sufficient to match the benefits under the plan or not. Madam Speaker, this is the way that every other pension plan in the province, by law, is required to operate and it ought to be the same for this one as well.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, members may have different views on where we go from here. I understand the government wants to see this bill passed; I understand that the Liberal Party wants to see this bill passed. We've certainly given it a lot of thought. I've pointed out a few ways that the bill falls short, and I certainly believe that it continues to fall short of where it could have gone. Having said that, this bill, the only bill presented to us to deal with the members' retirement plan, is at least a small, modest step forward. It is progress on an issue that has bothered Nova Scotians for many, many years. In our Party we're not ones to stand in the way of progress, no matter how small that progress may be. I just wanted to say, as we speak to the bill and deal with the bill today, that we are going to recognize that it is a modest step forward. It is going in the right direction, it is a sign of progress, and so we obviously support progress when we see it.</p>
<p>We'll have to leave it to Nova Scotians to decide whether it's sufficient, and my Party is already on the record in that regard. With those few words, I will take my place and go on with the business of the day.</p></speech>
