            <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Today Capital Health has started ramping down their services to Nova Scotians in anticipation of a strike. Real Nova Scotians are now facing actual service cancellations and postponed important medical procedures. In other words, patient care is now already at risk, despite what the Premier says. My question to the Premier is, will he tell the House today how he plans to protect patient care, starting now?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5">
            <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, as all members of this House would know, and indeed all Nova Scotians know, there are challenges between the employer, which is Capital Health, and NSGEU, when it comes to providing nursing services in the capital region. As they would also know, the process is unfolding through the collective bargaining process. We are, like all Nova Scotians, watching it and encouraging both sides to get back to the table to ensure that Nova Scotians have the services that they need and want, when they want them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what Nova Scotians know is that their Premier told them that he would protect their health care, but today real notices are going out about cancelled health care procedures, tests, and otherwise. They are not protected today because of the anticipation of a strike.</p>
<p>The Premier says he is disappointed in the actions on both sides and the amount of rhetoric that is being displayed in the media as the negotiations go on, yet he himself has jumped in with his own overheated rhetoric, making matters worse. He is the one who threatened nurses by questioning their licences and telling them that they were in violation of their code of ethics - and I will table those quotes for the benefit of the House.</p>
<p>I ask the Premier, how does questioning the integrity of nurses help protect patient care?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition couldn't be more wrong, quite frankly. We've continued to actually tell Nova Scotians the valuable contribution that nurses make in the health care system of this province. They do operate under a code of ethics and the Leader of the Official Opposition would know that it's the College of Registered Nurses that would be the body that those RNs and nurses would report to.</p>
<p>What we have clearly said is that in these very difficult times around bargaining we would like both sides to get back to the table to ensure that we find an agreement that both sides can live with, and that Nova Scotians actually receive the health care services when they want them, at the time they want them, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, actually it's the Premier who is mistaken. What Nova Scotians want is a Premier who says the same thing - and saying something is not the same as doing something. They are looking for action now that real medical tests and procedures are being cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p>What I mean by that, Mr. Speaker, is that in Opposition the Premier actually encouraged the Government of Nova Scotia to get involved in a labour dispute at Capital Health, between the health authority and the workers. He said at that time, just a year ago, that they, meaning the government, are the employer, so it's important for them to make sure that they solve these disputes as quickly as possible, without the labour interruption. And I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier.</p>
<p>One week ago he said exactly the opposite, that he, himself, is actually not the employer, even though Nova Scotians know who ultimately is paying the bills and pulling the strings. So do you know what, Mr. Speaker? It's time for straight answers - will the Premier get to the point today, when real procedures are being cancelled and tell Nova Scotians the plan to protect their patient care?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as you know, any time there is this kind of negotiation that is moving very close to potentially what could be a labour disruption, there are lots of anxieties, not only through those who are involved in this from a working point of view but obviously those Nova Scotians who are receiving and looking to receive those services. That's why we've continued to encourage both sides to get back to the table - the employer, which is Capital Health, and the NSGEU, which is the union representing the nurses in Capital Health.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'll go one step further, Nova Scotians know that if there's one Leader in this House who goes back on his word, it's not the Premier. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, 2,300 registered nurses throughout the Capital District Health Authority will be in a legal strike position on April 3<sup>rd</sup>. At the heart of this dispute is that nurses are regularly working short-handed - and I'm sure all members of this House are hearing from nurses who are very concerned about patient safety, as well as their own health and safety.</p>
<p>My question through you to the Premier is, will the Premier tell us what he is doing to reassure nurses that they are respected and they are heard?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, our government continues to ensure that Nova Scotians have access to health care where and when they need it. It is extremely important that we recognize the valuable contribution that all health care providers provide to the people of this province.</p>
<p>I want to remind all members of this House that it is Capital Health that is the employer in this dispute, Mr. Speaker, that is now dealing with the NSGEU, and through a number of times, through collective bargaining agreements across this province, unions and their employers have been able to work out the ratio when it comes to ensuring that the proper levels of staffing are happening in all the various aspects of delivering health care to this province.</p></speech>

            <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, since contract talks have broken off, the Premier has done little more than add fuel to the fire by stating that nurses should face discipline before their licensing body if they take job action. He made these statements before the provincially-appointed mediator had even brought the parties together. I want to have the Premier explain how exactly such comments could be a constructive intervention into this dispute, especially at such a critical point in the negotiating process?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is our sincere hope that both the employer and the union will go back to the table. We've encouraged them at every turn to go back to the table so that we can try to find a negotiated settlement that would allow both sides to continue to provide the services to Nova Scotians that they require and that they want. It is our sincere hope that that happens.</p>
<p>I want to remind the members of this House that this contract has been outstanding for almost two years now. We've been in power for six months. This is a difficult challenge for all Nova Scotians, but we are watching and allowing the collective bargaining process to happen, and at the end of the day, we will make sure that Nova Scotians are protected when it comes to the delivery of health care services.</p></speech>

MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier may only have been the Premier for six months, but he sat in this House for many, many years, and said many, many things about the collective bargaining process. Let me remind him that when he sat on this side of the House he told Nova Scotians that he believed in collective bargaining, yet just 28 days ago we saw a reversal on that position with the home support workers.</p>
<p>I want to ask the Premier, why does he no longer believe in the collective bargaining process?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. I want to remind all members of this House that 28 days ago we brought in essential service legislation that protected the right to strike for health care workers.

<p>I want to remind the Leader of the New Democratic Party that there has been a time in our history when the right to strike was taken away from health care workers - from paramedics, not too long ago, under the New Democratic Party Government of Nova Scotia.

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to return to the theme of Leaders who are consistent in what they say to the people of Nova Scotia. When he was running for office, the Premier told the Cape Breton Post that he wouldn't legislate against work stoppages in the health care system. Quoting directly, "The Liberals have no plans to legislate against work stoppages in the health system, McNeil said."</p>
<p>Hospital workers took him at his word on that, but of course that was when he was trying to get their votes. Now we're all waiting to see what the government's plan to protect patient care is. My simple question to the Premier, who said one thing six short months ago and is going to do the opposite now: which statement should Nova Scotians rely on today - what the Premier said when he was running, or the ones now?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we're going to allow the collective bargaining process to continue. It is our hope that the employer and the union will come to the table to ensure that they find an agreement that satisfies both sides and that will ensure that we provide the services to Nova Scotians. At no time have I or our government, in any way, removed the right to strike from health care workers in this province, at any time.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we are soon going to have a strike on our hands at Capital Health with the vital services that nurses provide. Surgeries, labs, and clinics are going to be scaled back or cancelled, or closed. The Premier has inflamed the situation by questioning the ethics of nurses, threatening to refer them to their own college of nurses. Nova Scotians do not want to see the end of their health care service or even a gigantic reduction in health care services. Can the Premier assure Nova Scotians today that their health care will not be lowered, reduced, or otherwise stopped due to a contract dispute?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every Nova Scotian would agree that nurses are vital to our health care system. The care they provide is second to none. Nurses insist that their staffing levels on our wards and hospitals are inadequate and that they are overworked and stressed out. The Premier, of course, is trying to silence them on this issue by threatening to take them to their own college of nurses. My question to the Premier - the person responsible ultimately for the health care system - is, has he taken any steps to assure himself that our hospitals are, in fact, adequately staffed?</p></speech>

Honestly, we are trying to figure out what the Premier is for and what he intends to do and we are not getting any straight answers on that today, while already important procedures are starting to be cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p>It is the role of the government to lead and primarily to protect the health care that Nova Scotians rely on every day. Nurses are saying that they are overworked, that they are stressed out, that there is too much overtime, that there are real wards that are understaffed. They may be right. We have to find that out, Mr. Speaker, and ultimately it is the elected government that looks after our health care system. So I will ask the Premier quite simply, what action has the Premier taken to ensure there really are appropriate levels of nursing staff in our hospitals?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the Leader of the Official Opposition that the government is not at the bargaining table; it is the employer and the union. I also want to remind this House that the Minister of Health and Wellness, in the first five months of being the minister, has been traveling the province working with district health authorities to ensure that we streamline administration and health care system, ensure that we make sure they have the appropriate level of staffing in every hospital across this region, to ensure that every community gets access to health care when and where we need it at the appropriate levels and quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, that employees who work for district health authorities and work in the health care system feel appreciated.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know the nurses don't feel appreciated by a Premier who actually calls their ethics into question when they raise questions about whether our hospital wards are properly staffed or not. He can point the fingers at as many other places as he wants; it is his government that needs to make sure that our hospitals are properly staffed, not by threatening people who want to bargain collectively but by doing the job of running the province including our health care system. I will ask the Premier, when will he take steps to make sure our hospitals are properly staffed?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, through you to the Leader of the Official Opposition and all Nova Scotians, on October 22, 2013, this government started ensuring that not only would health care be properly staffed but that the money was being spent on front-line health care and not administration.</p>

BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we're going to see over the next few days how good a job the government does at making sure those health care services are there all of the time and for everybody that needs them. Today Capital Health is winding down real health care services to real Nova Scotians. That means that everyday people are going without the health care services that they need, and we're here in this House and we're ready to pass something that helps them know, without worry, that they'll get the care they need. But he doesn't answer the questions about what the plan is. We'll wait all through the weekend and into next week while more and more surgeries and other procedures are cancelled.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, it was indeed the hope of all Nova Scotians that the collective bargaining process would have worked by now and that we would have had a settlement that both sides would be happy with. But in the collective bargaining process, you end up reaching the point where both union and employer find it difficult at times; they move away from conversation. It's our hope that they get back to the table so that they can make sure that the strike will be averted and that Nova Scotians will continue to receive the health care services that they want.</p>

MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's just been five months since this Party formed government, and Nova Scotia is already facing its second health care strike. Back in 2007, when the Premier sat on the Opposition benches, he wrote an opinion piece in which he said, "The collective bargaining process is working in Nova Scotia. Our healthcare workers want to be on the job, not the picket line." I'll table a copy of that opinion piece.</p>
<p>My question for the Premier is, why are health care workers suddenly having to go on the picket line under his government?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I still believe the collective bargaining process is the right way to solve the issues that are being faced between the union and their employer in the health care sector. We're allowing that process to unfold. Quite frankly, the reason we've had two challenges come up is because the previous government ignored them for almost two years.</p>

<p>In 2007, the Premier said in the same opinion piece, "Our [health care] system has not been plagued with strikes or work stoppages &#x2026; In the last 25 years there have been three hospital strikes in Nova Scotia." Today that's 32 years, and there have been three.</p>
<p>My question for the Premier is, is a plague of chaos in the health care system what we can expect under your government?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>No, Mr. Speaker. When I wrote that opinion piece in 2007 I had no idea that Nova Scotians would have a government that would neglect health care bargaining for four years like happened under the previous government. I want to assure the member and all Nova Scotians that this government is going to continue to work to make sure that all those who provide services to Nova Scotians recognize that they are appreciated and recognize that there's a fiscal challenge the province is in, and that we will operate and deliver those services inside of that envelope.</p>

<blockquote>"Many of the province's healthcare workers are on the front line everyday, they know what happens if they are not there to provide care to Nova Scotians when they need it. They know better than anyone else how important their jobs are and how much people rely on their care everyday (sic)."</blockquote>
<p>So my final question to the Premier, Mr. Speaker, if he believes that nurses know best what they need to do their job, why is he publicly dismissing their concerns about the impact of staff shortages on public safety?</p></speech>

There is absolutely no question that nurses and all health care providers provide a valuable service to Nova Scotians. It is our job, as government, to ensure that that service will be there, but we need to allow the collective bargaining process to happen, as an employer, working with the union.</p>
<p>I want to assure all members of this House that we have heard from nurses who want to continue to work; they want to ensure that the service is there for Nova Scotians. We hope their union and their employer can come together to ensure that all of those get an opportunity to continue to deliver the great quality of service they have been to Nova Scotians.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the honourable Minister of Finance and Treasury Board.</p>
<p>We learned this week that the minister will table her budget on April 3<sup>rd</sup>; April 3<sup>rd</sup> is shaping up to be a terrible day for Nova Scotians. Sadly, we learned that this Liberal budget will not be balanced and that our debt will continue to increase.</p>
<p>While in Opposition in 2008, the Leader of the Liberal Party said that until we conquer our own debt, we will continue to be slaves to it, as well as our children and their children. I agree with that statement and I'm sure most members of this House do as well.</p>
<p>So my question today for the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board is, why has the minister chosen to allow Nova Scotians to continue to be slaves to debt, rather than take bold action to conquer it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the question from the honourable member. Again, the member doesn't know yet what's in our budget for next week but I have signalled that there will be a deficit, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think it's important for all members of the House to realize exactly how much our revenues have been hit, which I told the chamber of commerce this week, and how deeply we have to work hard to grow the economy. That's the best answer for us to get out of the situation and, in the meantime, we have critical services that have to be delivered.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her answer - it's not an answer that's unfamiliar to Nova Scotians. Nova Scotians are looking to the government for answers as to how we can do that, how we can get a plan to increase our revenues. Every day, in households across Nova Scotia, people are concerned about their own debt, people are losing sleep about the amount of their debt.</p>
<p>My question today is if Nova Scotians are concerned about debt, why doesn't this government seem to be concerned about it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2">
            <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, in answer to that, absolutely, I think all members of the House are concerned about the level of debt we carry. In the last four years the debt has risen by $1.5 billion and that's certainly something we would like to see slow down, stop, and eventually be reversed. That isn't something you can do in a time when there's not enough revenue to balance the books at this moment, so it's really a question of how we move forward - and with the help of all Nova Scotians. It isn't government's job alone to build the economy, we have to set the stage and work with Nova Scotians.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her answer and, indeed, I agree it is the job of government to create an environment where business has a chance to be successful. Nova Scotians are making sacrifices every day; every day they decide what they can afford and what they can't afford.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the problem with debt is you have to service it. Our debt costs are impeding the government's ability to make the lives of Nova Scotians better. Our debt service costs today are the third-highest expenditure of the government - nearly $900 million to service our debt. That's $900 million that will not go to services; $900 million that will not go to tax relief; and $900 million that will not go to our health care services or education system. It will go towards our debt. We need to start finding an answer today to bring this debt down.</p>
<p>My question for the minister today is, why should Nova Scotians accept another year without leadership and a budget that will continue to enslave Nova Scotians to increasing debt and higher debt service costs?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think the member opposite has done a good job explaining the scope of the debt. The impact that it has on our annual budget is significant and the cost really is a burden for all Nova Scotians and all of us who seek services and know that the money is going elsewhere, but that is a debt that has grown over many, many years. A great deal of it grew during the years of the Tory Government in the 1980s, a huge increase. It has grown over a long time and it is not something that you can immediately turn around.</p>
<p>I think we have to look to the future to grow our economy, to seize a lot of the opportunities that we have in different sectors and to really build up our business community, again, through creating the right environment, in order to get the money that we need to start working on this big issue. Thank you.</p></speech>

Previous to the election of this Liberal Government, work stoppages in health care were about as commonplace as the Leafs making the playoffs, but now since the short five months this crowd has been in power, we have seen strikes by home care workers and now they are threatening to cause a strike with nurses in the Capital District Health Authority.</p>
<p>I want to ask the minister, just a month ago they gave around $100,000 to a has-been Liberal Cabinet Minister from Ontario to tell the Minister of Finance how to run the taxes in the Province of Nova Scotia, are they contemplating the same, getting an outside Liberal hack to help them understand labour relations in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

<p>Just a few weeks ago the Premier told home care workers if they didn't take the deal that was on the table, there would be something worse there. I want to ask that minister, why is she doing the Premier's bidding? Why does she support the Premier and his attack on locals and the unions and health care that are predominantly made up of women?

In Official Opposition, the Liberals agreed that the Cabinet should not - and I repeat, should not - be in control of the Cabinet-controlled Jobs Fund. The Traves report also says that the Jobs Fund should have independent oversight.</p>
<p>Will the minister commit to removing Cabinet control from this fund?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. Since we have been elected, other than the Yarmouth ferry deal, which had been negotiated by the previous administration, our government has not used the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund.</p></speech>

We don't need a second NSBI or another layer of bureaucracy to hold up important economic investments. I'm just wondering, when will we get on with the game changes that this province needs, and when will you show real leadership in taking those bold changes?</p>

We asked Dr. Traves to review the tools being used in Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. As well, we undertook a review of venture capital to see whether that was being used as well as it should be used to the benefit of this province.</p>
<p>We just received a report a week ago. We are working through that right now, as indicated. Changes are coming to the Jobs Fund, and we're looking forward to implementing Dr. Traves' recommendations. In fact, a lot of that work is currently underway. A number of initiatives have already been implemented, and I'll certainly be announcing more in the days and weeks to come.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Liberal Party ran an election based on a promise and a message that there would be no more public money for big companies. In Official Opposition, the Premier said the following about the Cabinet-controlled fund: "This is nothing more than a sham. Government should be embarrassed to stand up and suggest that this is rebranding, that this is about trying to be optimistic about the future. This is nothing more than keeping the old fund available to this Cabinet. If they really wanted to try something different, maybe they would have moved the investment arm out of government to an arm's length, the business arm."</p>
<p>My question is, is this a case of the Liberal Party saying one thing before the election and another after, or will the minister promise to move the investment arm out of government?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, sometimes it's a disadvantage to having been around this Legislature a long time, but other times it becomes useful. I remember the 1999 election campaign. In fact, I believe the Leader of the Official Opposition may be able to assist the member, because I believe he may have worked on the platform at that time for the John Hamm Government, which promised that if elected it would not use the Industrial Expansion Fund and there would be no more handouts to business. Now that lasted about six months before Premier Hamm brought back the Industrial Expansion Fund. Now I have to say in his defence, he was an amateur in the use of that fund compared to the last government that used $800 million dollars of taxpayers' money through that fund with little to no oversight.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I said in my previous answer, actions speak louder than words. Other than the Yarmouth ferry funding, which was negotiated by the previous government, our government has not used the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund and the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund will exist no longer, once the changes are implemented.</p></speech>

Every day in our province nurses are providing a care to Nova Scotians when they need it the most. It is a hard job; it's a frustrating job, and at times it can be a thankless job. You don't have to take my word for it. In November the Health Minister told The Chronicle Herald, "And nobody should have to come to work and work in an environment where there's no chance of getting a break whatsoever from the demands of the job because they are one nurse short."</p>
<p>But today, while nurses at Capital Health are saying they are regularly working shorthanded and are worried about patient safety, we have the Premier in the media stating that there are enough nurses. So I'd like to ask the Minister of Health and Wellness, through you, Mr. Speaker, if he thinks nurses at Capital Health deserve to be given a break when they need it or does he agree with the Premier that they are asking for too much?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>I thank the honourable member for the question. One of the basic realities and facts about the number of nurses in Nova Scotia is that as a group we are well above the national average on a given floor, a given unit. We can have a call-in, very late before a shift, and there may be times when staff is down a little bit. But overall we don't hear of major complaints about lack of staffing to handle - especially at the QEII - the highest levels of tertiary care. Those patients are getting outstanding care from the nurses at the QEII.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>I'm hearing from nurses quite often over the last number of months and what the minister is describing is not what I'm hearing from those nurses. On February 6<sup>th</sup> of this year the minister wrote in the column of the Kings County Register, "As minister of health, it is my job to improve the health of all citizens. To do this, we need a population that looks after its own health." One of those ways the public could look after its own health, the minister said, was by listening to nurses prescribing daily exercise.</p>
<p>So my question through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Health and Wellness, is simple. If he thinks it crucial for our health care system for Nova Scotians to listen to nurses, why is this government refusing to do the same?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, through you to the honourable member, we first of all have the highest regard for nurses right across Nova Scotia. We listen to them. At the present time there is a very challenging, very difficult labour dispute between their employer and the Nova Scotia Government &amp; General Employees Union. On a day-to-day basis, the work that our nurses do in our hospitals, in public health, in nursing homes, in all those areas - we will continue to listen to what they need in the profession. We know that we're fortunate to have three outstanding nursing training institutions in the province and daily, their work as a result of that great training, goes into practise to provide high quality care for Nova Scotians, right across the province.</p>

<p>In the same article from February 6<sup>th</sup>, the minister also said, "Imagine if health care works like banks." My question to the minister, is he going to continue running his department like a bank, placing dollars and cents ahead of patient safety and nurses' collective bargaining rights, or is he going to start doing his job which, he says, is to improve the health care of all citizens of our province?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I think the first months have gone well as I've gotten to know the system from one end of the province to the other. I think you'll see that our budget for health this year will speak volumes in terms of wanting to improve the system, reduce wait times, and make sure that our nurses and all employees in the health care system are adequately compensated. And that regard for their work, in fact, will be seen as we put on the table what I consider to be a responsible and a responsive call to making sure there are dollars for Nova Scotians to get the care they well deserve.</p>

<p>The lobster industry in Nova Scotia is a $1 billion industry engaging upwards of 13,000 people from Yarmouth to Cape Breton. Yesterday an historic lobster summit was held, bringing together three Maritime Fisheries Ministers and more than 200 fishermen, processors, and industry experts to discuss the four key recommendations outlined in the Maritime Lobster Panel Report released last Fall.</p>
<p>Will the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture provide the House with an update on the importance of this summit and the industry?</p></speech>

It is an historic day today, we had the three Atlantic Fisheries Ministers and also the federal minister working co-operatively toward moving the lobster industry to a sustainable, profitable industry in Nova Scotia and indeed in Atlantic Canada. It has been an historic day and we continue to work together and try to evolve these industries into a profitable industry from the wharf right through to the people who sell the lobster in an international market. Indeed we have to move forward and grow the economy in the lobster industry, as we do in the fishing industry and the other industries I represent.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to see this happening; it's a wonderful relationship we've struck with the other two provincial governments and the federal government and it is historic. In the past there hasn't been that type of co-operation and I'm very proud to say our government is encouraging that, and we'll move forward to make sure that our industries are profitable now and in the future.</p></speech>

Again, I would commend the Canadian Lobster Value Recovery Summit for meeting during such inclement weather in the last two days. I know those have been very important meetings and have had a number of results.</p>
<p>The Maritime Lobster Panel Report that was presented four months ago had a number of recommendations - I believe 33 recommendations. Can the minister provide an update on where we are with those 33 recommendations in that report?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#aef785d7-7697-4453-8f9c-eef26e4928c3"><from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that will take a lot longer than we have today and tomorrow and next week to answer all of those 33 requirements, but we are making progress in the industry. We are moving forward, we have been working with the industry sector, and we have many challenges, as all my colleagues in this Legislature who represent rural fishing communities would know.</p>
<p>We are making progress. We will continue to work with the industry at all levels and to ensure that we have those in place. It's extremely important that we do. This is the most important employer in the whole province, the fishing industry, and a lot of people don't realize that. We've exceeded $1 billion in export sales this year alone, and we employ roughly 13,500 people directly, but over 22,000 people in the province - by far the largest employer in the province.</p></speech>

There are seven recommendations in that that are due within the first six months of 2014, and one of those is that the government immediately begin to work to ensure proper legislation is prepared and ready when the industry decides to proceed with the approach.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister be tabling legislation in this session to support the changes the industry wants to make?</p></speech>

But we want to consult with the industry more before we do that. It's not only going to be Nova Scotia that does this. It's going to be Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick as well. We're working co-operatively with the other two provinces, as we will with the federal government, to ensure we can put a levy in place that will market Nova Scotia - not only Nova Scotia lobster, but a Canadian-brand lobster that will demand a much higher price than we get today, ultimately putting more money on the wharves and in the hands of fishermen in Nova Scotia as well as the processors and everyone in between.</p>
<p>It's important we do this, and important we do it in an orderly manner. I'm looking forward to the consultation we will have with industry. At the end of the day, we're going to implement that.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, certainly the Ivany report is a valid document and a document that we support.

Over the past number of weeks we've worked vigorously with a number of municipalities to pursue that very option.</p>

Despite the minister's anticipated commitment to the Ivany goals, he threw up his hands and walked away rather than roll up his sleeves and work to improve the services for the people of Pictou County.</p>
<p>Why won't the minister lead the way to a solution for Pictou County residents rather than walking away when the going gets tough?</p></speech>

I actually travelled to Pictou County on the eve of the storm and spent a couple of hours with the elected officials - mayors, wardens, and CAOs. I shared the findings of our discussion of two weeks previous. I want to assure my colleague that this government is taking the lead in municipal reform and I'll be back to Pictou County next week to further discussions with municipalities that want to pursue another model of government.</p>

Westville is running a deficit as the 2013-14 budget year winds to a close. Meanwhile, the minister seems to be showing up for some meetings but is also taking a hands-off approach to municipal reform in Pictou County. Why is he prepared to watch communities that need the leadership now, not next year or the year after, while communities are dissolving, instead of working towards solutions immediately?</p>

In fact, when the previous government had a program to shine a spotlight on March madness and try and put an end to it, I thought that was the right thing to do.

<p>To the best of my knowledge, the departments are well aware of the need to conserve. That doesn't mean spending stops in March.

Last Fall I was contacted by farmers in Inverness County who use wood ash from the Point Tupper biomass plant to fertilize their fields. It's a low-cost alternative to fertilize; it improves crop yields and of course it eliminates having to dump it in a landfill.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency maintains that it is safe for use and I understood at the time that this government agreed. However, I understand that now the government is saying no to it. Why not allow the farmers to make good use of this resource?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d20d446c-118f-4445-81f4-cf995b335391"><from>HON. RANDY DELOREY</from><p>I do recall the scenario that played out in the Fall with respect to wood ash, Mr. Speaker. What actually did take place is that there were some changes in the regulatory body that govern the components that make up that wood ash. There were some concerns about some of the heavy metal components in that output and laying that out in our fields. The position taken in the Fall was that we had inconclusive information and we allowed the product to continue until we had conclusive information. The information has been clarified and a new position has been taken.</p>
<p>I would refer, potentially, to the Minister of Agriculture who may have more to add if you have further questions about the response that has been taken in the agricultural space on that decision.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, as I understand, all agricultural products that are sold and applied to fertilized fields have to meet the Canadian Food Inspection Agency standards, and all other provinces are following these standards. The fact that we are using a different standard here now is hurting the business case for farming operations right across the province. The CFIA agrees that the ash is safe and beneficial, and our farmers want to use it. Why not let them use it?</p>

            <p>In the case of the particular ash product here in the Province of Nova Scotia, it has not been certified by the federal agency. In fact, what the Department of Environment is regulating is a waste product from the facility producing the ash, and in fact we do have different regulations for managing waste products - those are the regulations that my department puts in place. The product in question has not been certified by the federal government as indicated. If it was, it would perhaps raise a different set of questions.</p>

I think the government needs to be careful, because I also understand that lime is considered a Class B fertilizer and in effect they may be suggesting that the agricultural community cannot use lime. So there have been decades of research to show the value and safety of wood ash to agriculture.</p>
<p>Other provinces and states have even given environmental awards for wood ash programs, and not only has this program improved soil pH, it has also reduced a reliance on fossil fuel fertilizers. Will the minister reconsider his decision?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#71280477-3de0-4cef-90bd-e23864226ad3"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Capital Health began ramping down their services today to prepare for a possible strike. They reported their emergency services plan, which shows just how significant the cutbacks will be. The government cannot stand idly by while real Nova Scotians have their health care put in jeopardy due to a labour dispute. People need to know their health care is going to be there when they need it.</p>
<p>Nurses are vital to our health care system, and the care they provide is second to none. Nova Scotians deserve better than this. The high-quality care our nurses offer is something they have come to expect of our health care system. People across the province would agree that nurses' work is incredibly hard, and they may have an excellent point regarding workloads and staffing in our wards. It is up to the government, who ultimately oversees the hospitals, to make sure they are properly staffed. Real Nova Scotians are going to be impacted by the cutbacks in health services, and we all know people who have been impacted. These people are afraid, and so am I.</p>
<p>Starting today, the in-patient detox unit will close. There will be no nurses in the hematology clinic. There will be no eye surgeries, and patients admitted to the hospital will be put on huge, long waiting lists, as more than 50 per cent of the beds are closing. Patients who travel to Nova Scotia to be treated at our renowned QEII Health Sciences Centre have already been transferred back to Prince Edward Island. Patients from out of province who were scheduled to have cardiac surgeries performed here are already being rerouted.</p>
<p>Capital Health has reported that the East Coast Forensic Hospital will have staffing levels they have deemed unsafe. This is unacceptable. Nova Scotians cannot stand by while important services like these become unavailable. They deserve better than that.</p>
<p>The government has done nothing but add overheated rhetoric to this problem, which does not do anything to help protect patients. The government has made the situation worse by antagonizing nurses and showing a lack of leadership. This government needs to guarantee that Nova Scotians will have access to health care they can rely on. Cooler heads must prevail to protect patients.</p>
<p>In closing, Mr. Speaker, the government should reflect on how dangerous this situation could get and make sure nurses are heard and respected. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity today to speak to a very important issue that is at hand in the Capital District of the province. First of all, I think all of us in the province at one time or another have had contact with a nurse in one of our hospitals, our health care centres, nursing homes, public health, or through our school system.</p>
<p>I think it's very important to state clearly and categorically that the work of nurses is critical to providing top-quality health care in our province. They are well-trained, with many, many years of collective experience. In fact, a lot of very specialized training is required, especially for a number of nurses who provide and assist with the tertiary level care that is provided at the QE II.</p>
<p>I think it's very important, however, to set a little bit of context in that nurses are part of a team and today in our health care system we know that scopes of practice have changed really fairly dramatically over a couple of decades and so there's a great number of support staff, there are new technologies that assist nurses in their work. Having the right complement of all the professionals, as much of the modern technology and support certainly aids in the flow of work of our nurses.</p>
<p>We also need to be cognizant of the fact that this is a Capital Health and NSGEU issue. The work in nine of our 10 districts will go on and in fact, as part of the contingency plan, some of the nine districts are prepared to take patients back, prepared to assist patients in terms of making sure that they get the appropriate service that they require. So it is indeed fortunate that we do have that ability to rely on, again, other districts to support in the event of a strike, that patients and Nova Scotians can be assured they will have access.</p>
<p>Does it mean there will be a slowdown in services? That's pretty obvious, when we don't have the normal complement of nurses in their units and on their floors. However, we hope that if there is a strike, that the emergency provisions that are in the current contract will make sure that those who are in need of emergency care, urgent care, obviously dialysis, these areas that are required on a very regular basis, somebody who is in chemotherapy, radiation - we certainly don't want to see any disruptions taking place.</p>
<p>You know, I've put a lot of faith in the process of reaching what we would hope is a fair and equitable settlement. We know that sometimes it may not be about staffing ratios, it may be about responsiveness to acuity levels, to scheduling. I know a new program did provide in the early days some challenges, but it is my understanding that it is working much better and making the kind of adjustments that are required.</p>
<p>A hospital, and especially a place like the QE II in particular, is a very, very dynamic institution that requires a great deal of flexibility, as well, in terms of having the right number of nurses, the nursing experience level and specialized skills that are required. We all realize that there in fact may be some times when that may not be quite to the level, but we know that Capital Health administration, nurse managers, work diligently to make sure that that in fact is in place on a daily basis and responds to the varied needs.</p>
<p>I think it's important to point out at this time that with having two unions in the province - we have one with over 5,000 nurses who are also very cognizant of the fact of having the right number of nurses, the right complement at a given time. I do understand that the language of the contract signed in October provides that kind of flexibility that will allow them to deal with higher levels of workload. Also, if we have seasonal variations that come along, especially due to flu, sometimes there can be higher levels of patients who are receiving chemotherapy and so forth.</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia Nurses' Union was the first in the Atlantic Provinces to achieve language that allows for that kind of important adjustment without having to appeal and without having to go through any rigorous process in order to get the right number of nurses that are required on a given basis. I think that is great progress.</p>
<p>In terms of the mandatory nurse-patient ratios, I think it takes away - this is my perspective - that it does take away some of the flexibility and it can have some negative impact on the health care system as hospitals in California experienced when they brought in mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios. In fact, on my tour I had a couple, a husband and wife nursing team, who gave me their personal account of having been in a California hospital when nurse-patient ratios came in. When they came in, they applauded. They said this is a good day that we're going to have an extra nurse, an extra pair of hands, that kind of professionalism that will allow us to do a higher quality of job.</p>
<p>However, that was fine; it worked for about six months. The next year they were dealing with the same budget, and this was right across hospitals in California, and out the door started going an LPN, clerical staff, night watchmen, reduced hours of pharmacists. You have so many dollars to run the institution and they found that in order to keep the nurse ratios that had been mandated, they were not able to keep the complement of complete staff that they required.</p>
<p>I think if we leave it to health care administrators to collaborate, to develop a viable and sustainable formula for what is best on a given floor, on a given day, in a given week, that kind of professionalism will come through. It does not need the kind of strict nurse-patient ratios. We can go in most hospitals during summertime when we know that surgeons take holidays as well, and there may not be as many surgeries or may not be as many procedures going on. We need flexibility in the system and I believe that can be achieved without that current outstanding issue. Thank you.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable Leader of the New Democratic Party.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the Official Opposition for bringing forward this resolution so we can have a bit of a debate here at, I think, a very important time on a very important topic.</p>
<p>There is this kind of clich&#xE9; that you often hear - but clich&#xE9;s come from reality in some ways, they are generally based on fact - and it is that nurses are the backbone of the health care system. I would say that, as someone who is a health care professional, a social worker, and who very much values the team approach in health care, it would be a grave mistake on anyone's part to think that other members of the health care team, in any way, shape or form, are the same as a nurse, or can substitute in terms of the work that nurses do. You know, physiotherapists, OTs, social workers, pharmacists - we all have our roles to play in the health care system, but very few of us work 24/7 at the bedside providing that hands-on care when people are critically ill and in need of monitoring in terms of what the physician has prescribed, and the monitoring of the vital signs which are so absolutely critical in an acute care facility or, indeed, in a tertiary care facility.</p>
<p>So make no mistake about this, Mr. Speaker, if nurses in this province, experienced nurses and new nurses - but I'm hearing from nurses who have been in the system for 25, 28, and 30 years - make no mistake that those nurses are saying that the system is broken in terms of workplace overload, and that it's putting them under an enormous amount of stress and distress in terms of the care that they are able to provide. Then Houston, we have a problem - and we need to be listening to that problem, and we need to be responding to that problem.</p>
<p>I think minimizing the problem - and I've heard the Minister of Health and Wellness, and I've heard the CEO from the Capital District Health Authority talk about the team, and I'm all for team in the health care field but, let's be crystal clear, if nurses are calling in sick and they are working short-handed and they're feeling stressed and they are concerned about the kind of care that patients are receiving, then we all should be very, very, very concerned about that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think pretty much everybody has a nurse in their family. My grandmother was a nurse, and I look up and down my street and I have on my street these neighbours who are just wonderful, wonderful women who work in the nursing profession: a young woman who works in the ER at the IWK, and a woman who is probably more my age, who after a very long period of time in the health care field the stress and the strain of doing that work affected her own health to the point that she was unable to be a nurse anymore. I see the kind of passion that my young neighbour brings to her profession, and I've observed the passion that my older neighbour has brought to her profession and I see the end result of working in this field for many, many years and the cost that that can have, the personal toll it will take on nurses.</p>
<p>We need to be very careful about how we address this issue. This is a serious issue, it needs to be taken seriously and it needs to be treated with the kind of attention that we would give to any workplace where people are telling us that the conditions are not good conditions under which to perform their work.</p>
<p>The minister talked about California and the fact that mandatory ratios did not work in California. You know, Mr. Speaker, I have no views on mandatory ratios - I'm not a nurse, I'm not somebody who works on the front lines, I'm not a nurse manager, I have no skills in terms of planning the delivery of health care in an acute care situation, but what I do know something about is health care and health care in different parts of the world. And I'll tell you if there is one state in the U.S. which I would not go to as a matter of fact to look for practice to transport into our country necessarily, let me tell you if there was a state that I wouldn't look at it would be the State of California. Anybody who has spent any time reading about not just health care in the United States, but police services and fire services and public services more generally, would not look at the State of California.</p>
<p>The State of California has, in their preoccupation to not have any public services, entered into a kind of public policy there that has robbed citizens of that state of any quality public services whatsoever. So I don't think it is the best reference point for us to look at, in terms of whether mandatory nurse-patient ratios are something that can succeed or not. Surely with all the resources that the government has available to it, it can look further than the State of California.</p>
<p>The final point, Mr. Speaker - and I'm not sure how much time I have left - but the final point I would say is how important it is for us to encourage the parties to get back to the table and reach a negotiated settlement there. The deep concern I have is that the government has botched this and has made it less likely that a negotiated settlement is possible. The reason for that is the way this government dealt with the health care workers.</p>
<p>You know it doesn't give me confidence that the employer in the Capital District went to the table knowing that is where a solution had to be reached. If they think they have a government that is going to whip into the House of Assembly with essential services legislation and bring the hammer down on health care workers, why in the world would they have to bargain at the bargaining table and try to find a solution to the problems the nurses have brought to their attention?</p>
<p>That's the problem here, Mr. Speaker. I think we have seen ourselves boxed into this situation now that is very difficult to get out of. To get out of it will require leadership from the Premier on this, not threats, not sitting back and just letting the clock tick. This requires leadership and involvement from the Premier. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>
