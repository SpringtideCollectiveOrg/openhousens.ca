<p>Whereas every year on December 6<sup>th</sup>, Nova Scotians and Canadians look back at the Halifax Explosion of 1917 as a defining moment in the culture and heritage of this province; and</p>
<p>Whereas with the centenary of this tragic event that took the lives of thousands of people approaching, the stories and emotions that emerged from the disaster are still being passed down from generation to generation; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Nova Scotia Archives has collected and documented many first-hand accounts of the Halifax Explosion and is launching a new project using Twitter to collect even more stories from Nova Scotians;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Nova Scotia Legislature take a moment today to remember the 2,000 people who died from the explosion and its aftermath, and to wish the Nova Scotia Archives great success as it continues to capture this moment in time that has so deeply affected the people of Nova Scotia for almost a century.</p>

Marilyn is celebrating her 41<sup>st</sup> Anniversary in scouting with the Wolfville Cub Pack. As well, she is one of the founders of the Wolfville Food Bank, and is an active member of the Grannies, raising funds to help grandmothers who look after grandchildren in Africa whose parents died of AIDS. Marilyn is personally helping a Grannie to support two grandchildren in Africa.</p>
<p>Marilyn is most recently a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. Marilyn still works with the Wolfville Food Bank and helps to coordinate the support for up to 160 families a month. Marilyn did all of this volunteer work while working as the administrative assistant at the Wolfville Baptist Church, and is now well into retirement for the last three years - and one would be remiss if we did not mention, with the help of her beloved husband, Charlie.</p>

            <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier revealed that his government had commissioned a secret $85,000 study on the viability of the Muskrat and alternatives to this project. My question to the Premier is, why did the Premier withhold the fact that the study has been underway since September?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the important fact here, of course, is that the study is being done, an analysis is being done to compare all of the alternatives for Muskrat Falls to ensure that Nova Scotians get the fairest and lowest power rates. That is our commitment. Our commitment is to make sure that the project is well researched, well analyzed, that the appropriate models are put in place, and I don't think this would come as a surprise to the Leader of the Opposition. We don't want to be in a position where the Utility and Review Board is just relying on the opinion generated by Emera or by Nova Scotia Power. So it's in the best interests of the people of Nova Scotia that the report be done and be done well in advance of the Utility and Review Board.</p>

So my question to the Premier is, will the Premier (Interruptions) Sorry, I'm sure you called it, Premier, I want to give you credit for doing something this session.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, will the Premier release the terms of reference of this study immediately?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I don't really have any problem with the release of the terms of reference. What they will show is exactly what I've said, which is that it is to look at the comparison of the various available projects that might be able to supply Nova Scotians, because we here on this side, what we are committed to is ensuring that Nova Scotians get the lowest, fairest electricity rates - unlike the Liberals who have a plan of deregulation that would drive up power rates 30 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians already know the NDP Government have driven up power rates 30 per cent.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the Premier will release today the terms of reference around the study, but I wonder if the Premier could also tell this House why he dished out an $85,000 contract untendered - could the Premier explain to this House why that went untendered?</p></speech>

They then went out through a number of proposals, because there was no response. The renewable electricity administrator, among everything else, has knowledge about the Atlantic Canadian market, they have already had the experience associated with a lot of the background research, so this person and this company was in the best position to be able to complete the work on a timely basis.</p>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier unveiled that his government is doing a secret study on Muskrat Falls for months. Not only did he keep it a secret from the people of Nova Scotia, but at least on two occasions during emergency debate in this House, on the very topic of an independent review of Muskrat Falls, the Premier failed to disclose that he was doing just such a review.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, now we know that he hand-picked the consultant doing the Muskrat Falls review. My question to the Premier is, did he hand pick his own consultant to do the review to ensure that Nova Scotians did not know what he was up to?</p>
<p>THE PREMER: Mr. Speaker, it's kind of an odd assertion, isn't it? I announced the study yesterday in front of 500 people of the Chamber of Commerce, so it's difficult to understand how that could possibly be construed as a secret.</p>
<p>What is not a secret, Mr. Speaker, is that the company that was chosen to do this was chosen through a process to be the renewable electricity administrator, did work with respect to the coal regulations that the federal government brought in, and is in the best position to deliver the best value to the people of Nova Scotia so they can be assured that they will benefit from the lowest and fairest rates.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier is trying to say that this study is independent, but it is far from independent. The province's own renewable energy administrator is actually the one who the Premier has chosen to do a study.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, a little while ago the consumer advocate wrote a letter to the renewable energy administrator in which he says the renewable RFP "&#x2026; would unnecessarily increase annual ratepayer bills by millions of dollars, by acquiring far too much renewable energy &#x2026;" And I will table that letter for the benefit of the House.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the renewable energy administrator was designed to impartially determine which projects were best able to meet the needs of Nova Scotians on the renewable energy, or the renewable electricity plan. That plan will actually deliver the most stable rates that this province has seen in its history, because it will be part of an integrated energy portfolio that will allow us to keep rates at the lowest possible price for ratepayers.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the people of Nova Scotia, who are going to pay the bills for the Premier's expensive plans, want a full and open and transparent review of Muskrat Falls compared to all the alternatives.

<p>I wonder, as he says for some period of time, he's been asking for this kind of analysis. He has a great opinion with respect to the project, but what is it based on?

Continuing on with this secret contract, the Premier spent a lot of time saying why Mr. Dalton was chosen. I think we all know why Mr. Dalton was chosen, and it was because the government didn't want somebody truly independent. The draft RFP for the round of renewable energy procurement, prepared by Mr. Dalton, was heavily criticized by the consumer advocate. Mr. Dalton refused to accept any of the fundamental changes because the rules set by the government wouldn't allow such changes.</p>
<p>&#xFFFD;Will the Premier explain how a consultant with a history of just simply following the NDP line would provide a truly independent review of Muskrat Falls?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Dalton company was chosen after an exhaustive review where there were proposals brought forward examined as to their completeness, and he was chosen because not only of the past expertise that he had but because he was able to do an analysis of these projects in a completely independent fashion. So this is serving the most basic needs in our system, one where all of the applications that came forward were being reviewed transparently, independently, and fairly.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that search was so exhaustive, it didn't include a tender or an RFP. I'm just amazed.</p>
<p>We know Mr. Dalton's history in Nova Scotia. According to the consumer advocate, Mr. Dalton's decisions were unnecessarily increasing ratepayer bills by millions of dollars. And I'll table that, Mr. Speaker. The Premier has said Mr. Dalton was chosen because he knows the energy market in Nova Scotia. Well many other people do, too. But Mr. Dalton's history is partnering with the NDP to unnecessarily raise power bills.</p>
<p>Will the Premier admit that his choice of Mr. Dalton, who the consumer advocate accused of unnecessarily increasing ratepayer bills by millions of dollars, was not at all about ensuring that Muskrat Falls is the most affordable option, but rather about ensuring someone was picked to endorse the NDP's continued track for higher power rates and the Premier's decision to move forward with the project without even knowing the cost?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I realize this is the time for debate, but this is Question Period, and if he wants me to answer his question, I'm happy to do that. It's necessary to correct that part of what he said.</p>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that the desire of the members on this side is to ensure that we achieve a number of things with respect to energy, security, and rates. And that is to ensure that the people of Nova Scotia get the lowest, fairest possible rates; that we not be held hostage to any one provider or any one source over the long term; that we have a strategic piece of infrastructure which is going to allow us to be connected to the wider energy grid of the province; and to have a consultant that is going to be able to compare those projects independently and fairly - and that's what we intend to achieve.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I understand the Premier has trouble distinguishing between the facts and his talking points, but maybe he should go and read Hansard tomorrow. He will see that the RFP and tender that I referred to him not doing, was for Mr. Dalton's work on this particular study.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dalton is also good friends with Nova Scotia Power. In fact, in August Mr. Dalton awarded all three independent power purchase projects to three wind contracts to companies backed by Nova Scotia Power. Again, it was supposed to be independent, but they all went to Nova Scotia Power - and let's not forget Nova Scotia Power could only be part of those projects because the NDP changed the regulations to allow them during the millions of dollars more profit from ratepayers.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, why has the Premier hand-picked an analyst, with close ties to the government and a history of siding with Nova Scotia Power over ratepayers, to assess Muskrat Falls?</p></speech>

Today, of all days, this province needs to address this issue, not just from the top down but with the grassroots community organizations that actually make recommendations and offer perspectives based on their work with thousands of women and children impacted by violence in this province. The Domestic Violence Action Plan Coordinating Committee does not include any community members - actions are taken to address the Plan's recommendations without the input of community organizations.</p>
<p>My question is for the Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act. Why is it that the Domestic Violence Action Plan appears to be none of communities' business now?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5da6e0aa-9066-4b5c-8d26-9222b854db7e"><from>HON. MARILYN MORE</from><p>I think most members of the House realize that the community was very involved and engaged in developing the Domestic Violence Action Plan. Many recommendations came forward from the joint committee - it was jointly chaired by a community member, and I believe it was the head of the office for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women at that time.</p>
<p>There were many recommendations in there that required action, research, policy changes, and better coordination within government. That is the cross-departmental committee that is now working under the leadership of senior staff from the Department of Justice and the Department of Labour and Advanced Education through the Status of Women Advisory Council Office.</p>
<p>&#xFFFD;On an annual basis, we are pleased to report back on our progress. As part of that internal plan we are strengthening our relationships with community groups and working more collaboratively together, and certainly the feedback we're getting from organizations across this province and other service providers is that the relationship is working extremely well, and we are making progress working together.</p></speech>

It was the voice of community that ensured that the Neighbours, Friends and Family line would be answered by people trained to deal with domestic abuse. Organizations doing this work have not seen an increase in funding to provide this service. Community groups are dealing with the effects of violence against women every day, yet they have not received any increase in funding from this government to do this new work.</p>
<p>My question is, will the minister invest in the Domestic Violence Action Plan and see to it that these groups are funded to do this important work?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5da6e0aa-9066-4b5c-8d26-9222b854db7e"><from>MS. MORE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, government, community groups, businesses - we're all challenged in these current times to live within our means. While we've raised domestic violence and violence against women as a priority across community and government, we have to make sure that our budgets are focused on meeting those priorities. I believe in our first year of office we did make a significant additional contribution to the transition houses across Nova Scotia, that I believe are the lead organizations for that particular help line, and we continue to work very well with them.</p>
<p>Believe me, if we had more money available from the taxpayers of the province, certainly domestic violence and violence against women would continue to be a high priority, but we have to work in a very balanced way. We are funding most of the organizations through various departments. Those organizations are our front-line service providers. They regularly report back on their progress. We're all in a state of transition in terms of making sure we allocate our resources to those priorities.</p>
<p>We take every opportunity possible to thank and congratulate and show our appreciation to those community organizations for a job well done. Thank you.</p></speech>

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, to the Premier, today is the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, an important time for all of us to reflect on the issue of violence against women and girls in Nova Scotia. The Intimate Partner Violence Tracking Project does track cases of violence against women and girls, but it does not actually provide for the tracking of violent offenders.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier, will he now empower judges to put GPS tracking devices on violent offenders in order to protect the victims of domestic violence?</p></speech>

It's kind of ironic on this day that the only recommendation that the Progressive Conservative Leader would have is to put a bracelet on it. The courts have the authority. They have the ability to make those decisions, and there has been nothing cut from that program there. I guess we could say it every day, we could give them that message, and every day they don't receive it. I don't understand what we need to do differently to communicate that, but the courts have the expertise.</p>
<p>I want to say that's different - one thing that's significantly from this caucus and that side of the House is that we believe in the judges and their decision-making. We believe in the police officers and their operations, and we believe in the probation services and corrections. That's something different than what they hold.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the government that today is the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. I can assure the minister that we will ask this question every day over and over again, until he gets serious about taking all the steps necessary, taking all the actions that can be taken, to protect women and girls from domestic violence, including tracking the offenders.</p>
<p>The other day, the member for Inverness told this House the story about a young woman in Truro who had been brutally assaulted by her partner, and who reported in the Truro Daily News, which I'll table, that she was disappointed and felt unsafe when he was released on bail with no electronic monitoring device to keep her safe from him.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the Intimate Partner Violence Tracking report it's very clear that 59 per cent of violent offenders had, as a condition of their release, that they have no contact with the victim, and the sad truth is that too often that condition is ignored and women are at risk all over again. With that knowledge from the government's own report, I'll ask the Premier, will he ensure that there is no further violation of the conditions of release, such as staying away from the victim, by reinstating the GPS electronic monitoring program to keep women and girls safe?</p></speech>

I spent 35-plus years as a police officer and this issue is very important to me, and I'm very committed to the safety and take that seriously, and any allegations to the contrary, I take exception to. What I want to focus on is the fact that this government put forth the Domestic Violence Court and in that court it's a matter of trying to get people to take responsibility and accountability to change behaviours.</p>
<p>I know that when the Progressive Conservatives get up here and ask questions, that they want to build more jails and they want to put more people in jails but, remember, we're dealing with family structures and although people make mistakes and they make poor judgments, and they make decisions that can impact the community and the family, but without education, without processes to give supports, both to the victims and to the people who are committing the crimes to change behaviour, you're going to continually have the same circle of violence and breaches in society's rules. So the difference is here the Progressive Conservatives believe in building jails and filling them, not building families and educating the community.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to hear that the minister says this is an important issue to him. I wish he would realize how important this issue is to the victims and their families of the women and young girls of Nova Scotia. It's them that we should be focused on and not what's important to the minister and I would only further say that rather than spending his time making up what he believes is the philosophy of the Progressive Conservatives, perhaps he should read the reports of his own government because the Intimate Partner Violence Tracking Project reports that when a sentence of probation is imposed on a domestic violence offender, in 87 per cent of guilty cases they're released on probation.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, will the minister now, in light of his own report where 87 per cent of offenders are released on probation, agree to reinstitute the GPS tracking program for people who are violent, who are offenders, who are convicted, who are out on probation, to ensure that they cannot reoffend and that our women and children, victims of domestic violence, are kept safe?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, it is all about the community, about the victim, and ensuring that they're safe. That's what my job is and I take that seriously, and I'm committed to that. I want to just reiterate my point that the courts have the full authority and ability to assign the issue on bracelets. I know that the Progressive Conservatives are locked mentally in that process and they can only see that that is one way of making it. They are available, they are within the system, and the difference between that side of the House and this side of the House is, I will reiterate and I will state again, the Progressive Conservatives believe in building jails and filling them.</p>

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier told Nova Scotians at the Halifax Chamber of Commerce lunch that his secret study into Muskrat Falls is able to look at all alternatives, including natural gas. I only wish that were true. The truth is that his study is looking at a review of alternatives including gas and wind - the key word being "and" - that they must look at gas and wind in combination and not just gas alone as a cheaper and cleaner alternative.</p>
<p>Will the Premier set the record straight about the terms of his secret study and assure Nova Scotians that it will include all alternatives - gas and wind - and also the use of more natural gas in its own right?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what I will confirm for the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is that any alternative would also have to meet the terms of the federally mandated greenhouse gas reduction regulations. If an alternative could not meet those, then they could not be considered.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, since we are looking for a full and complete review of all the options, I'm not sure if that was a yes or a no that this secret study can look at gas or not - even though Nova Scotians know gas is far cleaner than coal, and it's also much cheaper around the world.</p>
<p>During the emergency debate on Muskrat Falls, on Tuesday, the member for Halifax Atlantic said, "I am very, very pleased to hear that we are able to have such firm predictions as 2 per cent to 3 per cent increases &#x2026;" in electricity prices because it is such a predictable thing. I will table that for the benefit of the House.</p>
<p>The whole point is that families cannot afford further increases year after year of 2 to 3 per cent in their electricity prices as the Premier's government seems determined to charge them. So my question to the Premier is, will he ensure that his secret study is truly allowed to look at all options available to Nova Scotians, including natural gas?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I've already said that it will look at natural gas; in fact, as natural gas has been lower in price we've actually seen the utility use more and more of it - next year they expect it will be about 25 per cent of the load.</p>
<p>One of the things I pointed out the other day is that natural gas, as a fossil fuel, is subject to very rapid escalations. Although we see on the world market a very low rate, in Nova Scotia last week it was at $14 an MMBTU - a very, very high rate. This is the problem - you don't want to have your consumers locked into these wildly vacillating prices; you want to be able to ramp up or ramp down the usage within an energy portfolio in order to be assured that you have a stable rate, therefore delivering the lowest, fairest rate.</p>
<p>What the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party doesn't seem to understand is that the system they put in place has now delivered a system that is delivering the very increases that he is seeing. What we want to do is stop that.</p></speech>

<p>The need hasn't changed, Mr. Speaker, and the government report is now three years old. Could the minister please tell the residents of Digby why, after three years, they still don't have a dialysis unit at the Digby General Hospital?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we know that patients who have to gain access to dialysis services often have the burden of time-consuming travel to receive that care. That's why we asked for consultation to try to figure out what the true picture looked like in the province when it comes to those individuals, those Nova Scotians gaining access to dialysis services.</p>
<p>No question, we have limited finances. We are dealing over the last three years with a financial mess that the former Progressive Conservative Government left us in; but saying that, we continue to invest in dialysis. We know that we need to try to reduce the burden placed on Nova Scotians, especially with travel time when it comes to dialysis.</p>
<p>We recently made some announcements as we move forward to ensure that Nova Scotians have timely access to dialysis, Mr. Speaker. We're going to continue to do that as we move forward to hopefully lessen that burden on Nova Scotians.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#169d581a-9c34-47f3-9660-9ccb38d06bf4"><from>MR. THERIAULT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, on April 4, 2012, the Deputy Minister of Health and Wellness, while appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, stated, "We have individuals in Digby who have to travel farther &#x2026; if we had the money to move a dialysis centre, we would go to Digby first because of the greater distance they have to travel than any other individual in this province." I'll table those quotes.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, last week necessary funding for a dialysis unit was announced for the Valley Regional Hospital, despite commitments made by the Deputy Minister of Health and Wellness that Digby would be first. My question is, when can the residents of Digby expect the satellite dialysis unit to open at the Digby General Hospital?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as I said, there's no question that finances of the province play a role in how we address services, especially in health care here in our province. Knowing that, as we make investments - the investments that we just made and future investments - we'll continue to look at areas of the province. That's why we recently made the announcement in the investment in Kentville, because we looked at the region of the province. If we have only a limited amount of finances to provide additional services for dialysis, what area and in what community would it have the most impact on Nova Scotians? Placing it in Kentville has the most impact on the number of people we can address and hopefully improve the services.</p>
<p>We know that in Digby and in other areas there are hard-to-reach individuals who are seeking services through dialysis. That's why we've invested over $1 million to renovate dialysis units across the province, but also the expansion of home therapies, an area that not many Nova Scotians take advantage of. I know it's an area that it's difficult for someone to make the decision to have home dialysis, but we're encouraging Nova Scotians that it's an option for them to reduce the opportunity for their length of travel to seek dialysis services.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Community Services. LaHave Manor is a non-profit organization that enhances the quality of life for adults who are specially challenged. The manor provides wonderful residential care and supportive community living to teach life, independence and social skills to adults with individual challenges while transitioning these skills for everyday living and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Recently the Canadian Auto Workers Union has successfully organized employees at the LaHave Manor in Bridgewater. One key in organizing this was the CAW was using the NDP's harmful first contract arbitration law. The imposition of a first contract could drastically affect the quality of life for residents and see the services they've come to expect and depend on disappear, the unintended consequences of bad NDP legislation.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, which side is the minister on? Will she stand alongside her Cabinet colleagues and continue to defend the NDP's harmful first contract legislation or will she stand up for the vulnerable men and women who have depended on the services provided by LaHave Manor and urge her boss to scrap the bad law?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, certainly the LaHave Manor, I know it well, I know the participants who go there and staff and it's a fabulous service provider for us. I think it's fairly ridiculous that the member would stretch a story that far to think that because there is an opportunity for unionization there, if there's a decision of the employees to go that route, that that would in any way have an ill effect on the operation of LaHave Manor. That's really stretching it.</p>

The contract put forth to the board could have had a devastating effect on the programs and services provided to the residents, programs that those individuals depend on. Programs for people with special needs may be cut and the people who run these programs could lose their jobs.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, when will the minister decide to take the job seriously and stop protecting NDP bad laws and start protecting the vulnerable residents who depend on the services provided by this minister?</p></speech>

ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it was learned recently that the YMCA and pool facility at Nova Scotia Community College's Akerley Campus is under threat of closure. Five years ago a deal was reached between the Nova Scotia Community College, the YMCA, HRM and the province to keep the facility open which is a resource used by students, the community, the Boys and Girls Club and many others. Now it seems it may close because the province and the Nova Scotia Community College seem unwilling to consider creative options to expand classroom space without removing the pool and that's despite the fact that the province put $0.5 million into renovating the pool just a few years ago.</p>
<p>My question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal who is responsible for the facility there, why is the government allowing the pool and YMCA facility at the Akerley Campus to close?</p></speech>

<p>To this point, the community college has offered free space to the Y. They also are going through a period of analyzing their space needs. I certainly will await the outcome of those discussions and negotiations. Thank you.</p></speech>

The Y is now advising clients in the community that the pool and their facility will be closing.</p>
<p>The minister is right that the community college, in return for reduced rates at the Y for NSCC students, was giving them free rent and the municipality was kicking in a cash contribution each year. So now it seems that Dartmouth East lost a rink under the watch of the Tories, and now we'll lose the pool and the YMCA under the watch of the NDP.</p>
<p>There are many options and this is about getting together and finding a solution. After the province put $0.5 million into renovating that pool, Mr. Speaker, will the minister agree to meet with the Y, representatives of the community college, HRM staff, and community leaders to find an alternative to the Y and the pool closing?</p></speech>

Egg Studios recently announced they will continue to pursue legal recourse and a judicial review appeal to the Supreme Court in their effort to reverse the decision of the NDP's new labour board, under NDP law, to certify a group of technical employees earlier this year.</p>
<p>Egg is not anti-union, Mr. Speaker. They are a responsible employer who negotiates in good faith. The problem lies in the fact that the NDP's new labour board, under NDP law, has granted IATSE certification to a designation of people Egg hires for an average of five days a year. These individuals, according to Egg President Sara Thomas, "&#x2026; have virtually no ongoing connection to our company. What's more, the majority of these workers were not even given an opportunity to vote on whether to unionize."</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education is, when will the minister admit that her heavy-handed NDP Government has dramatically tipped the scales as job creators and commit to changing the law to eliminate this ridiculous type of outcome?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind the honourable member that our legislation consolidated the Labour Board. Most of those appointments, quite frankly, were made by previous governments. (Interruptions) I also want to remind everyone in this Chamber that men and women across this country have a constitutional right to collective bargaining. So the Labour Board followed its normal procedure around determining which employees were eligible to vote on the application and the Labour Board's decision, as he has referenced, is being appealed and because that matter is before the courts, I cannot comment further.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#250f8b2e-9af9-4ca7-9778-41b96426667e"><from>MR. BAIN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, normally in most workplaces, all employees within a certain job classification are eligible to vote on unionization. They must be present on the date of the certification application and the date of the vote. In the case of Egg Studios this did not happen. The NDP's new Labour Board made an exception and found that 11 technical workers engaged on one particular day were eligible to vote. More to the point, only five of them voted. There's simply no way of determining whether a majority of these workers even wanted to unionize.</p>
<p>Egg CEO Mike Hachey put it best when he said, "If the Labour Board is going to permit these kinds of occasional workers to unionize, there needs to be a fair process to determine whether the majority of workers actually want to unionize, which has always been one of the most important principles in trade union law." I'll table that.</p>
<p>So Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the minister is, when will the minister bring change to the NDP's overbearing laws and take the necessary steps to ensure a fair process is put in place to determine whether the majority of employees who actually work for any given employer want to unionize?</p></speech>

Nicholas Carroll is a young man from Margaree. He undertook a two-year program at the Nova Scotia Community College and today he is doing something he couldn't do here. He is working in Alberta. In Alberta, Nicholas found non-unionized work, and then he flew home to Sydney to pick up his apprenticeship papers. He returned months later only to discover that the time he spent working in Alberta would not count toward getting his apprenticeship papers.</p>
<p>I spoke to him on the phone just today. He spent $3,000 flying back and forth. The reason for not signing his papers? Nova Scotia does not have a partnership (Laughter)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we don't find this funny, and neither does Nicholas. Nova Scotia does not have a partnership with Alberta that allows Nicholas' two years spent learning his trade here in his home province to be recognized by Alberta's apprenticeship board.</p>
<p>My question is, will the minister pursue an agreement with the Government of Alberta that ensures young Nova Scotians like Nicholas Carroll who leave the province for job experiences and training are properly supported?</p></speech>

I would suggest, as I've offered for all members in this House, if they have a particular situation, to bring it to the department and we'll try to work through it. But on the broader issue, it is true that Alberta doesn't recognize the hours through the pre-apprenticeship program here in Nova Scotia. We are in negotiations with that province to show the quality of the programming here in Nova Scotia, and I am very hopeful that we will get equal recognition and an articulation agreement in place.</p>
<p>Our staff in Nova Scotia are doing everything possible to make sure that all hours are being recognized. I would encourage the member to take that particular situation to our staff or ask that individual to contact the regional officer, and we will try to be as accommodating as possible. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6918f31d-8900-4400-a42c-b0374b14b8ff"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, maybe it wasn't such a bad question after all. Young people like Nicholas rarely want to head to Alberta or elsewhere. They would much rather stay closer to home and closer to family. The problem stems from a lack of jobs here in this province. For Nova Scotians heading to Alberta for work, the only way they can get their apprenticeship papers signed is if they can find union work, because the union must become the employer or else the work experience does not count. To help people like Nicholas, this has to change.</p>
<p>My question is, will the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education remove roadblocks for people like Nicholas? As she says, it sounds like she is working toward it, which is a good thing, so we can help people like him get started in their careers.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5da6e0aa-9066-4b5c-8d26-9222b854db7e"><from>MS. MORE</from><p>I realize that this is a complex issue, but I have to say that the honourable member is totally wrong. There is nothing in our policy and guidelines that suggests that an apprentice from Nova Scotia must work in a unionized job in Alberta. There is absolutely nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>I think he is getting confused, Mr. Speaker, with the fact that you can stay registered in Nova Scotia if you have an employer in Nova Scotia who also works as an employer in Alberta. In some cases, some of the unions have taken on that extra role of monitoring apprentices in Alberta who are from Nova Scotia. We certainly encourage businesses that have a national profile and work across this province to take on that responsibility. One thing we will not do is send apprentices to Alberta without being monitored either by a national employer or union or monitored by the Alberta Government. That is not a safe situation; it doesn't ensure they get the oversight they need to continue in their career. Thank you.</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, very briefly, as the MLA for Richmond, we will be supporting this legislation as this is an agreement which was reached between the Municipality of Richmond and Pacific West Commercial Corporation regarding the property taxes to be paid by the mill in Point Tupper. In order to allow that agreement to take place, being that the amount of taxes paid is less than the assessed value there requires an amendment to the Municipal Government Act, therefore the county has brought this forward with a request that it be done by the Legislature, and we certainly will be respecting that request.</p>
<p>As I pointed out on second reading, this is a decision that was a difficult one for the county to reach. As a result of the discussions that took place, the county was forced to defend its position in court which, ironically, it was victorious in court and the agreement that had been signed in 2006 by StoraEnso and then which was extended to NewPage was held to be valid until 2016, and that the new operator would be bound by the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>In an effort to try to negotiate and do its part to try to make this entire deal work the municipality did agree, even after the court victory, to reduce the amount of property taxes that would be paid by Pacific West Commercial Corporation. This is a burden which will be faced by the residents of Richmond County, because this is significant revenue which no longer will be coming into the county's coffers going into 2016, and we can only hope that at that point the county will be able to negotiate a new agreement potentially so that the financial blow to the county will not be a tremendous burden.</p>
<p>On second reading I did raise concerns with the press release that did come from the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations. I appreciate the fact that he did accept that that was erroneous and it had missed actually acknowledging that it was the residents of Richmond County who were going to be doing their part as a result of this in the reduction in taxes paid. I am pleased that the minister did recognize that, and that going forward certainly there will be acknowledgement of the work and sacrifices that were made by the Richmond Municipal Council and the residents of Richmond County.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we are all hopeful that this mill will have a long future in the Strait area, specifically at the Point Tupper facility. Again, this is an important sacrifice being made by the Municipality of Richmond on behalf of all ratepayers in an attempt to try to make this mill a successful operation. Mer&#xE7;i.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, very briefly - I didn't have the opportunity to speak on this bill on second reading - while the intent of the bill is one that we certainly support, we have been receiving some e-mails and correspondence from Nova Scotians who are a bit concerned with how the police will be handling the information that they would be able to access as a result of this piece of legislation. So I just want to put on the record that there is a bit of unease, especially from those concerned about privacy concerns - how the information will be shared, will it be shared with family members once the police have obtained it, and is there additional information regarding an individual not relevant to the fact they've been missing that will be shared as well?</p>
<p>I'm certainly hopeful that the regulations that will be put there will certainly keep in mind privacy concerns, because oftentimes we may pass legislation here and at the time not really take into consideration what the impact could be. I look at the amendments that were made to the Elections Act where the government was proposing that the age of electors be identified on the lists made available to political Parties. We raised a concern at the time that that was an infringement on privacy and, at the end, the government decided to implement categories of ages rather than giving specific numbers. So that's just an example of what was seen as a good intention, that wasn't meant to violate privacy. At the end, upon sober second thought, I guess, on that one, it was seen that that may have been a bit of an infringement.</p>
<p>This bill has moved forward fairly quickly. It's not one that has been sitting on the order paper for an extensive period of time, which leaves me with concerns, the fact that we had no presenters at the Law Amendments Committee, that Nova Scotians may not have been fully tuned into this legislation and the potential impacts. We will be supporting it, but I simply wanted to put those few concerns on the record. We certainly support our police force and their efforts to try to find more timely ways of identifying when someone has gone missing, but at the end of the day we always want to make sure that the proper checks and balances are in place. The bill does raise some concerns, but I'm sure there might be some opportunities through the regulations to be able to strengthen that as well.</p>
<p>It is my understanding, and I've been critical of the government before for not consulting the chief privacy officer in Nova Scotia, but it is my understanding she was consulted. She did make some recommendations; in fact, I believe there were changes made as a result of some of the concerns that she did raise. So I want to commend the government for having brought that legislation to her attention prior to bringing it here to the House. But it is one that deals with sensitive matters and I'm certainly hopeful that the government will be mindful of that as we move forward and, if concerns are raised, that they'll be prepared to address those concerns at that time. Merci, monsieur le Pr&#xE9;sident.</p></speech>

          <heading>Bill No. 94 - House of Assembly Act.</heading>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>It's a bit bizarre that the Minister of Justice would not have moved this bill or make comments on it but there may be reasons for that. Mr. Speaker, Bill No. 94 is the legalization that deals with implementing new electoral boundaries for the Province of Nova Scotia. I certainly spent a significant amount of time on second reading talking about the process, from the establishment of the select committee to determine the terms of reference, to the work of the Electoral Boundaries Commission, to what has brought us here today.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I actually received a number of e-mails from individuals who are watching, thanking me for having explained to them exactly what happened because you have two Parties in the Legislature - both the Official Opposition and the Progressive Conservative Caucus - that obviously were not consulted and the terms of reference that were put in place, the government used its majority to impose those terms of reference, which is what brought a dissenting option at the select committee stage and I believe from there it has continued to be a tainted process.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to remind the government a bit of their roots on this issue; I didn't have the opportunity at second reading so I wanted to take the opportunity today. As many Nova Scotians know, prior to 1992 the government of the day is who would determine what electoral boundaries would be in the Province of Nova Scotia. In 1992, ironically, under a Progressive Conservative Government, it was decided by all three Parties in Nova Scotia - and yes back then the NDP did exist they did have representation here in this House - all three Parties agreed that it should go to an independent process but prior to getting to an independent process it would require the Parties of the day to decide what the terms of reference would be.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in 1992 the record will show that all three Parties, the Liberals, progressive Conservatives and the New Democratic Party, all unanimously agreed not only to the terms of reference but to the composition of the Electoral Boundaries Commission. The same was done in 2002. We all know what has happened in the 2011/2012 version.</p>
<p>Just to show you how much it was an historic day for our province back in 1992, with the help of our library staff here, I wanted to share some comments made by one of the members of the Legislature on April 28, it was a Tuesday in fact, 1992. The comments are from Alexa McDonough who then was the Leader of the New Democratic Party and in her opening remarks in the second paragraph she said:</p>
<blockquote>"I just want very briefly, uncharacteristically briefly, to express my satisfaction with the process that has taken place. I think the member for Halifax Citadel is correct when he indicates this is an historic first for this province to have launched an independent electoral boundaries process and I think, as he has indicated, there was an agreement reached by the three Party Leaders at the outset, that the purpose of this was to remove politics, remove any sense that members are influencing the setting of boundaries for reasons other than of broad public interest." </blockquote>
<p>She continues by saying:</p>
<blockquote>"I think the process that has ensued, the procedures established, the very open process of putting on the public record all submissions and the establishment of objective criteria that would be considered, have all respected that decision. I think it has been an extremely important one."&#xFFFD; </blockquote>
<p>I want to share just one more paragraph, when she continued by saying:</p>
<blockquote>"I think the one and only comment I want to make, is that I very much hope that we do not end up stepping backwards from that. If we begin to pick away and unravel the overall integrity of the proposal that has been brought forward by the Electoral Boundaries Commission, then I fear very much we will be stepping backwards and we will end up in a situation where the process will not see itself through to its logical conclusion." </blockquote>
<p>That was Alexa McDonough in 1992, with the New Democratic Party former Leader praising an independent electoral boundaries review process. I also wanted to share some other comments that were made in 1992, because this government has talked about how their interference in the terms of reference was because they wanted voter parity, that voter equality was a primary tenet of our democracy, and we could not continue what we are doing - at least, that's the excuse they gave.</p>
<p>So back on Tuesday, April 28, 1992, another individual who was a member at the time had a few comments regarding the report in 1992. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that it was in 1992 that the commission recommended for the first time that there be four ridings established which did not meet the population requirements to be within the percentage allowed for variance. Those ridings were Richmond, Clare, Argyle, and Preston - three for the Acadian community and one for the African-Nova Scotian community.</p>
<p>Today's version of the NDP tells us that those ridings are too small and they just could not be maintained - no way could that happen. So I thought it was interesting, the remarks of Tuesday, April 28, 1992, by a gentleman by the name of John Holm, who the government may remember - a long-time member of the New Democratic Party and a long-time House Leader for the New Democratic Party. Even back then, Mr. Speaker, as you know, because the ridings were beyond the variance, they were much smaller than some of the other ridings.</p>
<p>Here's what John Holm had to say:</p>
<blockquote>"I believe that it is reasonable. We have seen court challenges that have upheld the principle, that really what we are talking about is relative equality in terms of the number of voters. Looking at the list that was prepared by the Electoral Boundaries Commission, in terms of the estimated population for the 52 ridings, the population ranges will go from a high in estimates of 20,700 down to a low of around 9,000. So there is quite a range in size. The smaller ones are considerably smaller and for very good reasons and I support that. I think it is very important, for example, that seats be structured in such a way as to guarantee the continued representation or the opportunity for continued representation of the Acadian population. It is very important to make it easier for a member or a representative of the black community to become elected to this House." </blockquote>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that's how the NDP felt back in 1992. The arguments being put forward by this government were the same issues that were faced by the Legislature in 1992. Ironically, back then the NDP were in full support and stood up. John Holm was there praising having Acadian representation in this House and having representation from the African Nova Scotian community. How times have changed.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, with the assistance of the member for Halifax Chebucto, I also mentioned in the House that he was a member representing the NDP in 2002. He sat on the select committee to determine the terms of reference, and I mentioned in this House that at no time did he raise concerns with the terms of reference, which allowed for maintaining the Acadian ridings and the African Nova Scotian riding and the variance of 25 per cent.</p>
<p>He was very kind in bringing me over some of his comments from Hansard, after the bill was brought here. He indicated in there - and I will read what it says on November 5, 2002. The honourable member for Halifax Chebucto said:</p>
<blockquote>"Indeed, I think the next time this Legislature sits down to give directions to an Electoral Boundaries Commission that they should be looking at a number that is much smaller than plus or minus 25 per cent. Plus or minus 5 per cent, plus or minus 10 per cent, those are the kinds of numbers that ought to be looked at."</blockquote>
<p>I found that ironic because the Premier now, his new version is to say, well, there are some that wanted the variance to be less than 25 per cent so the ridings in rural Nova Scotia would be even larger if I had listened to them. We now know it was coming from within his own Party because the minutes from the select committee will also show that the government wanted a 20 per cent variance and only after the objections of the Opposition was it moved up to 25 per cent.</p>
<p>I also want to point out in that same discussion on November 5, 2002, the member for Halifax Chebucto said:</p>
<blockquote>"At this point, all we can say is that the next time we do this process, we have to take seriously the comments of the Electoral Boundaries Commission this time, their observation that we turn our mind specifically to those constituencies and ask ourselves whether it does make good social policy sense for those constituencies to continue." &#xFFFD;</blockquote>
<p>That was in 2002. We're still waiting to have that discussion about whether those constituencies should continue. That discussion never took place. The government struck a select committee to do terms of reference and went in and unilaterally decided what the terms of reference would be.</p>
<p>So rather than simply criticize what the government did, allow me to offer this - what could have been done differently? The electoral boundaries of this province are reviewed every 10 years so when this government came into office in 2009, they were not caught by surprise that a boundaries review was going to take place. It takes place every 10 years. They had up to two years of their mandate to prepare for this. In light of the concerns from the last boundary report, the concerns the member for Halifax Chebucto has raised in this House back in 2002, the government could have said, we're concerned with the amount of variance that now exists in Richmond, Clare, Argyle and Preston. While we think that the goals were great, the numbers have become so small - like in many rural Nova Scotia communities - something has to be done.</p>
<p>They could have gone to the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration acadienne de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse and said, let's have a discussion - is there any other way that we can achieve the same goal but not have these ridings as they currently exist because they are so much smaller than the average? They could have gone out to the African Nova Scotia community and said the same thing, Preston is too small, is there another way that we can ensure or do our best to ensure that there's representation from the African Nova Scotia community and how can we do that?</p>
<p>That would have been leadership. That would have been a responsible government because then they could have at least said, we went to the people, we went to these communities and we told them, we want you to help us find a solution. Two years into their mandate, they had two full years they could have done this and yet they chose not to. Only they know the answer to that. This could have been done differently. There was a way to do it, they chose not to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're now left with a situation that everyone knew was coming. We found out on Tuesday that the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration acadienne de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse will be taking legal action to protect the rights of Acadians in light of this assault on the rights of Acadians by this government. Ironically, when one looks back, the former Minister of Acadian Affairs almost mocked the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration acadienne in saying, they won't have a legal challenge, they don't have the funds, they don't have the resources, they don't have the will. Well, he only needs to look up in the gallery today if he ever questions what the will of the Acadian community is in the Province of Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the first NDP Government in the history of Nova Scotia would be the one government that would launch such an attack on minorities here in this province? Who would have thought? The last two times this was done, the NDP had no concerns, yet this time around while in government, all of a sudden this was an issue that had to be dealt with. Was there consultation? Were there discussions? Not only wasn't there with the communities impacted, but one only needs to look at the minutes of the select committee to see how the government unilaterally told staff, change the terms of reference.</p>
<p>Meetings that were held on December 23<sup>rd</sup> and December 30<sup>th</sup> of 2011, and the government rammed it through. We all recall what the Minister of Justice did with the interim report that was brought in by this independent commission, an independent commission that went out and heard from Nova Scotians and said, here's what we're hearing, they want to keep these protected ridings. One of the messages that came from them in the presentations that they heard was that the members for Richmond, Clare, and Argyle don't only represent Richmond, Clare, and Argyle - they are the voices of Acadians throughout Nova Scotia. Acadians from communities all around that were not in those ridings said that they are there to defend our rights, to speak up for us and to represent us. (Applause)</p>
<p>That was a turning point for the commission because at that point they said this is bigger than just protected ridings; it's so much bigger than that. What a day it was when that interim report came in, when Nova Scotians were able to say the government asked us for our opinion, we went, we gave it and they listened - it was a great day, people were celebrating.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, because it did not meet the political ends of this government. The Minister of Justice unilaterally, without any debate in this Chamber, on questionable legal opinion, which we have yet to see - a verbal opinion is what we've been told - decided on behalf of this Legislature to reject the interim report.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Null and void - and sent them back and said write it the way we told you to write it. Even when the final report was given the commission members, one of them was asked, Jim Bickerton, I believe - which I know the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal has made some comments about him publicly - he was asked, can Nova Scotians look at this and see it as truly an independent process? To paraphrase his answer, it was I don't even believe it was an independent process. So if you have a commissioner saying that, how can any Nova Scotian have confidence that this was an independent process? (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say again and it was interesting because I believe Corporate Research Associates did a poll asking about the protected ridings and I believe 47 per cent said, yeah, get rid of them - and I believe it was 43 per cent, 44 per cent, said, keep them. The Acadian population in Nova Scotia is probably less than 20 per cent of the entire population of Nova Scotia (Interruption) The numbers vary, but let me be generous and say it's 20. Unless CRA, in that 44 per cent who said keep the Acadian ridings, unless they only called Acadians, that would tell you that there are many Nova Scotians who support the Acadian community as well.</p>
<p>I said from day one that this government would regret attacking Acadians, attacking African Nova Scotians, because Nova Scotians don't stand for that. Any of the success that has been achieved by the Acadian community, the African Nova Scotian community is because the majority of Nova Scotians who are not Acadian and not African Nova Scotian have supported that, and I think that's why we're so proud to be Nova Scotians, so proud to see the support that has been given, whether it be through the Office of Acadian Affairs, the Office of African Nova Scotia Affairs, that is something for us to be proud of - and yet to watch a government launch such an attack.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians won't be fooled by this government. We all know that the ridings of Clare, Argyle, Richmond, and Preston, are all held by Opposition members. I would suggest to you that even Nova Scotians who are fair-minded realize that if the government held even one of these ridings we would have seen quite drastic and different terms of reference than what we saw. (Applause)</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in a process that should have been non-political, that should have been free of political interference, instead we're left with a process that was tainted from day one, tainted by this government using its majority to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to add one more comment before I say a few words en fran&#xE7;ais. About the Premier - when this process started, after the terms of reference were decided and we raised the concerns of what would happen to the protected ridings, the F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration acadienne did as well, the Premier and the Minister of Acadian Affairs at the time said oh, relax, when this is over, those areas will still have an Acadian flavour.</p>
<p>Now I don't know if that is something you get at the grocery store, if it's something you use for cooking, an Acadian flavour that you can sprinkle on your food, but I've never heard that before. So that is a new term from the NDP, that we're not going to give you a riding but we're going to give you a flavour. Now whether it comes in ice cream or other types, we're not sure yet, but the Acadians now, and the Acadian Federation, we give you a flavour, so you have a flavour in the ridings - not your own ridings but a flavour.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are not buying that, the Acadian community is not buying it and even for the government to say today all of those ridings, they still have enough Acadians in them - enough. That is the word from this government and it's quite unfortunate that this is going to go in front of the courts, where the Acadian community has to go in front of the courts to fight to protect its rights that the government has unilaterally taken away by its actions.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Speaker, there are others who will judge the actions of this government but I can say, I certainly want to say publicly, I can't thank my colleagues enough in our caucus who have stood united with us - myself, the member for Clare, the member for Preston - in supporting us in fighting for the people who have sent us here to represent them. We have been united throughout all of this and it makes me even prouder to be a Liberal and to be a member of the Liberal caucus under the leadership of our Leader.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, je veux juste terminer en disant quelques mots. La question de ce processus ici c'est, est-ce que &#xE7;a fait une diff&#xE9;rence s'il y a des Acadiens &#xE0; l'Assembl&#xE9;e ou pas? Quelle diff&#xE9;rence &#xE7;a fait? Qu'est-ce que les Acadiens, les d&#xE9;put&#xE9;s, qui ont &#xE9;t&#xE9; Acadiens ici, ont fait pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne, pour la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse?</p>
<p>Comme vous le savez, M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, nous en avons eu plusieurs, avant l'&#xE9;lection de ce gouvernement ici, si on regarde il y a 50 ans ou plus, il y avait toujours un Acadien au Cabinet de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse. Toujours. Au moins un, des fois deux, une fois, je pense qu'il y en avait peut-&#xEA;tre trois. Quelle diff&#xE9;rence &#xE7;a fait?</p>
<p>Allons regarder aux services qui sont l&#xE0;, maintenant, pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne. Nous avons l'Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne, une universit&#xE9; uniquement francophone, pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse. Apr&#xE8;s &#xE7;a, nous avons le Coll&#xE8;ge de l'Acadie, qui a &#xE9;t&#xE9; cr&#xE9;&#xE9; et on a vu des campus dans toutes les communaut&#xE9;s acadiennes &#xE0; travers la province, des petites communaut&#xE9;s, des plus grandes communaut&#xE9;s, qui avaient acc&#xE8;s &#xE0; une &#xE9;ducation postsecondaire dans la langue fran&#xE7;aise. Maintenant, comme vous le savez, le Coll&#xE8;ge de l'Acadie est devenu une partie de l'Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne, mais les campus sont encore l&#xE0; et je peux vous dire, M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, l'id&#xE9;e qu'un &#xE9;tudiant ou qu'une &#xE9;tudiante de Richmond puisse aller au campus de Petit-de-Grat et suivre des cours d'universit&#xE9; en fran&#xE7;ais, c'est remarquable qu'ils peuvent faire &#xE7;a.</p>
<p>L&#xE0;, nous avons vu que le gouvernement a cr&#xE9;&#xE9; le Conseil scolaire acadien provincial, qui a permis aux Acadiens d'avoir des &#xE9;coles dans leurs communaut&#xE9;s, pas juste pour pr&#xE9;server la langue, mais aussi la culture et l'identit&#xE9; acadienne, et ces &#xE9;coles-l&#xE0; ont &#xE9;t&#xE9; cr&#xE9;&#xE9;s dans les communaut&#xE9;s &#xE0; travers la province. Qu'est-ce que la r&#xE9;alit&#xE9; de ces &#xE9;coles-l&#xE0; aujourd'hui? Le Conseil scolaire acadien provincial est le seul conseil scolaire en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse qui a vu une augmentation dans les &#xE9;l&#xE8;ves de l'ann&#xE9;e pass&#xE9;e &#xE0; cette ann&#xE9;e. Quel succ&#xE8;s! Quel succ&#xE8;s! Qu'on doit tous &#xEA;tre en train de dire : c'est magnifique ce qu'on voit. Parce que maintenant, les gens qui ne sont peut-&#xEA;tre pas Acadiens ou francophones essayent de trouver des moyens d'envoyer leurs enfants aux &#xE9;coles du Conseil scolaire acadien provincial. Puis quelqu'un m'a demand&#xE9; l'autre jour, qu'est-ce qui arrive? Les enfants qui vont au Conseil scolaire acadien provincial, comment est leur connaissance de la langue anglaise? J'ai dit, tr&#xE8;s bonne question. L'ann&#xE9;e pass&#xE9;e, le Conseil scolaire acadien provincial &#xE9;tait le conseil scolaire qui avait la plus haute moyenne, dans les &#xE9;tudes provinciales, sur la langue anglaise. Son &#xE9;cole francophone avait les meilleurs pourcentages sur la langue anglaise. Ce n'est pas une question, pourquoi ils ont du succ&#xE8;s.</p>
<p>Derni&#xE8;rement, un des autres grand succ&#xE8;s, et je veux reconna&#xEE;tre mon coll&#xE8;gue d'Argyle, qui &#xE9;tait le ministre, qui a fait de ceci une r&#xE9;alit&#xE9;, c'est la <i>Loi sur les services en fran&#xE7;ais</i> en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, o&#xF9; nous avons une loi maintenant, qui dit que la Province de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, &#xE0; travers les fonctionnaires et les d&#xE9;partements, vont offrir des services en fran&#xE7;ais &#xE0; la communaut&#xE9; acadienne et francophone en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, je vous soumets que ces succ&#xE8;s, si non impossibles, auraient &#xE9;t&#xE9; beaucoup plus difficiles &#xE0; r&#xE9;aliser si on n'avait pas les voix des Acadiens, ici &#xE0; l'Assembl&#xE9;e, ici au gouvernement, ici au Cabinet. Mais, M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, avec ce nouveau gouvernement, pour la premi&#xE8;re fois, nous n'avons pas de voix pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne au gouvernement. Nous n'avons pas de voix pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne au gouvernement, et &#xE7;a, c'est tr&#xE8;s clair et je vous soumets que si on avait &#xE7;a, ce projet de loi ne serait pas devant nous aujourd'hui, comme tel, comme pr&#xE9;sent&#xE9;.</p>
<p>Alors, &#xE7;a sera une le&#xE7;on pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne, pour les prochaines &#xE9;lections. De toujours s'en rappeler, qu'est-ce qui a &#xE9;t&#xE9; fait par ce gouvernement.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, je veux remercier toutes les personnes qui ont travaill&#xE9; si dur quand nous avons eu les pr&#xE9;sentations, les r&#xE9;unions publiques, par la Commission &#xE9;lectorale, qui sont venus faire des pr&#xE9;sentations. Les jeunes, sp&#xE9;cialement les jeunes qui ont fait des vid&#xE9;os, qui ont fait des manifestations : comment fiers qu'on &#xE9;tait comme d&#xE9;put&#xE9;s de voir des jeunes de 14, 15, 16 ans, 17 ans, 18 ans, il y en avait d'eux qui n'avaient m&#xEA;me pas le droit de vote, qui &#xE9;taient en train de se battre pour la communaut&#xE9; acadienne, et je veux le dire encore : je m'en rappelle, quand ma ni&#xE8;ce m'a envoy&#xE9; un texte. On ne parle plus sur le t&#xE9;l&#xE9;phone, on envoie des textes. Elle m'a envoy&#xE9; un texte pour me dire : &#xAB; Mon oncle, la directrice de l'&#xE9;cole secondaire arrive de nous annoncer que le rapport par int&#xE9;rim de la Commission &#xE9;lectorale a &#xE9;t&#xE9; pr&#xE9;sent&#xE9; aujourd'hui et qu'on a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; nos si&#xE8;ges acadiens. &#xBB; Elle avait 16 ans. Ils ont annonc&#xE9; &#xE7;a &#xE0; l'&#xE9;cole, la directrice et tous les enfants se sont mis &#xE0; frapper des mains. Je vous soumets que ce gouvernement ne comprend pas que les circonscriptions de Richmond, Clare, Argyle ne sont pas seulement des circonscriptions politiques. Elles font partie de l'identit&#xE9;. Elles font partie de l'histoire et elles font partie du futur de la communaut&#xE9; acadienne. (Applaudissements)</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, je suis fier d'&#xEA;tre d&#xE9;put&#xE9; acadien, de pouvoir me prononcer dans cette Chambre, dans ma langue maternelle. J'esp&#xE8;re que le processus en cours aura du succ&#xE8;s et que le gouvernement, n'importe qui sera au gouvernement, au moment donn&#xE9;, va continuer de respecter les droits de la communaut&#xE9; acadienne.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, juste au cas o&#xF9; il y avait un doute, je peux vous assurer que je ne voterai pas pour le projet de loi 94, et je ferai mon mieux pour continuer, durant mon temps ici &#xE0; l'Assembl&#xE9;e, de me battre, pas juste pour toutes les personnes qui m'ont &#xE9;lu et qui m'ont envoy&#xE9; ici, mais certainement pour ne jamais oublier mes racines et jamais oublier ma fiert&#xE9; dans la communaut&#xE9; acadienne. Merci. (Applaudissements)</p></speech>

<p>L'HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT: Madame la Pr&#xE9;sidente, membres de l'Assembl&#xE9;e, je me mets ici, sans vraiment de texte pr&#xE9;par&#xE9;, pour parler du projet de loi 94, et m&#xEA;me dans ma r&#xE9;gion, ce projet de loi nonante-quatre. Quel fameux projet de loi que &#xE7;a va &#xEA;tre, dans nos r&#xE9;gions acadiennes, pour les Acadiens et les francophones, en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.</p>
<p>Il y a beaucoup de bl&#xE2;me qui a circul&#xE9; &#xE0; travers de cette Chambre pendant les derniers 12 mois, depuis qu'on a commenc&#xE9; avec le Comit&#xE9; sp&#xE9;cial sur les fronti&#xE8;res. Mais, quand &#xE7;a vient que la communaut&#xE9; a demand&#xE9; quelque chose, que &#xE7;a soit pendant les pr&#xE9;sentations qu'on a eues &#xE0; chaque communaut&#xE9; comme Comit&#xE9;, comme la Commission a eues, chaque fois qu'elle a visit&#xE9; des r&#xE9;gions &#xE0; travers la province. Chaque fois ils ont dit que les circonscriptions acadiennes sont importantes, qu'on doit trouver une fa&#xE7;on de les maintenir comme elles sont, pour faire s&#xFFFD;r que la repr&#xE9;sentation acadienne continue dans la Chambre d'assembl&#xE9;e.</p>
<p>C'est &#xE7;a que j'ai entendu comme membre du Comit&#xE9;, c'est &#xE7;a que j'ai entendu quand j'ai assist&#xE9; aux r&#xE9;unions de la Commission, que &#xE7;a soit en Argyle, que &#xE7;a soit en Clare et m&#xEA;me en parlant avec les autres qui ont eu la chance de participer dans chaque communaut&#xE9;, ils ont dit la m&#xEA;me chose. Ce que je trouve vraiment inqui&#xE9;tant, c'est qu'un gouvernement ait pris ces informations et a dit non, ce n'est pas important. Ce qu'on a entendu des N&#xE9;o-&#xC9;cossais, qu'on a entendu de la communaut&#xE9;, n'est pas important. Allez le refaire.</p>
<p>Quand on veut impliquer le monde dans quelque chose, on fait beaucoup de &#xAB; advertising &#xBB;, on fait beaucoup de choses pour faire s&#xFFFD;r qu'ils sont &#xE0; nos r&#xE9;unions. La plupart du temps, ils ne viennent pas, mais cette fois-ci, ils savaient que c'&#xE9;tait important d'assister &#xE0; ces r&#xE9;unions-l&#xE0;. De voir un groupe de personnes, une communaut&#xE9; qui est venue s'exprimer pendant ces r&#xE9;unions-l&#xE0;, c'est vraiment touchant parce que, comme je dis, souvent, nos communaut&#xE9;s, les communaut&#xE9;s, qu'elles soient acadiennes ou non, sont un peu passives. Bien, c'est la politique, on n'a pas besoin de se pr&#xE9;senter, ils vont nous prot&#xE9;ger. Mais, cette fois-ci, on n'a pas vu &#xE7;a, on a vu des pr&#xE9;sentations &#xE0; chaque fois. Si on vous demandait de nouveau, les Acadiens, des jeunes, d'autres organismes ou populations de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, si on leur demande de participer de nouveau, je sais ce qu'ils vont dire. Ils vont dire non. Ils ne nous ont pas &#xE9;cout&#xE9;s la derni&#xE8;re fois, pourquoi participer dans un processus &#xE9;lectoral politique? C'est &#xE7;a que je trouve dommage du processus qu'on vient juste de vivre.</p>
<p>On a le projet de loi devant nous maintenant. On a entendu plusieurs fois de notre premier ministre. Bien, les circonscriptions acadiennes, &#xE7;a existe encore. &#xC7;a existe encore. Bien, peut-&#xEA;tre qu'il y en a, Argyle Barrington, Digby, Clare, Richmond, qui incluent maintenant tout. Port Hawkesbury, non, c'est &#xE7;a, Cape Breton-Richmond. Peut-&#xEA;tre que le nom est l&#xE0;, mais la voix des Acadiens dans ces r&#xE9;gions-l&#xE0; est maintenant extr&#xEA;mement diminu&#xE9;e.</p>
<p>Quand je parlais l'autre jour &#xE0; un des m&#xE9;dias dehors, j'ai dit, comprenez &#xE7;a : si dans la r&#xE9;gion d'Argyle, et &#xE7;a c'est l'exemple que je connais le mieux maintenant, si je prends la r&#xE9;gion d'Argyle et j'additionne la r&#xE9;gion de Barrington, qui est un bon endroit, il y a de bonnes personnes l&#xE0; mais, la plupart de cette population-l&#xE0;, est anglophone. Donc on prend les 6 200, &#xE0; peu pr&#xE8;s, 6 500 de la r&#xE9;gion d'Argyle, on les additionne &#xE0; Barrington, qui est 6 300, ou quelque chose de m&#xEA;me, on les mets ensemble, &#xE7;a diminue le nombre d'Acadiens dans ma circonscription. Quand j'avais 60 pour 100, ce nombre-l&#xE0; maintenant diminue &#xE0;, je ne suis pas le ma&#xEE;tre sur &#xE7;a, je pense que c'est 28 pour 100, quelque chose de m&#xEA;me. C'est moins de 30 pour 100. Donc si je regarde ce que j'ai besoin de faire, comme d&#xE9;put&#xE9;, quand je viens les repr&#xE9;senter ici dans la Chambre, c'est maintenant du poids diminu&#xE9;, dans toutes les choses que j'ai besoin de faire comme d&#xE9;put&#xE9;. Donc, la voix des Acadiens est beaucoup moins forte aujourd'hui quand ce projet de loi va passer ici, dans la Chambre.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think what was even worse, as I talked about the population coming out to present during the public consultation phases of the number of committees that have been going around, people told us time and time again, please, do not split up our communities; please, protect linguistic rights in the Province of Nova Scotia. This is what they heard. This is not what they got. They got something completely different. More recently the member for Shelburne and the community of Shelburne came out in what I would say a spirited debate - they came before the Law Amendments Committee and said, please, don't split us up.</p>
<p>What we saw in the final is the Premier comes forward and says, no, no, no, we're not doing anything with this. We are going to accept it the way it is. Well, I feel badly for the member for Shelburne because his community is now being split in half. I feel badly for the constituency of Argyle that now loses its identity. I feel badly for the constituency of Queens that changes in a large way. It's historic. Life is different because of that change and addition to the community of Shelburne and the surrounding areas, but it's not what people asked for. Nowhere along this did the people of Nova Scotia get what they asked for, and do you know why? It is because politics got involved.</p>
<p>You know, when a process like this, when in 1992 you hear the good words of Alexa McDonough - I never thought I would say that - the good words of Alexa McDonough, it's difficult for me to say, but there were some good words there. (Interruption) She's a wonderful person and she had a very, very good sense of what was going on there - an Order of Nova Scotia recipient. She said, look, finally we're finding a way to take the politics out of boundary reviews. Yet in this process - I mean, really what should happen is that the government should have just gone and drafted everything all by themselves and done it because it didn't matter what we said as Opposition Parties at all. It didn't matter. They were going out to do what they felt was their right thing to do.</p>
<p>I mean we can get into the debate on who was right and who was wrong and all those things but, quite honestly, I think they have heard time and time again, and through the continuation and the end of this process, that they were wrong, that maybe, had this been set up the right way, the pain wouldn't be quite as much.</p>
<p>The government found itself in a bit of a quandary when the final report came out. I think originally they might have tried to do it to grab a few more constituencies, didn't really matter about the ones they didn't hold, and move on that way. I'm guessing that may be how the discussion started. In the end, they got affected just as much as everybody else but just because everybody gets to share the pain equally. It doesn't mean that it was a good process or it was a good end. I think the people who came and spoke, time and time again, their voices actually matter. Why didn't they matter in this particular case?</p>
<p>This is one of those things where I hate to say I told you so but if we read what the conclusion of the dissenting members of the select committee had to say, it's a little bit of an "I told you so". The majority opinion of the select committee not only ignores the findings of previous non-partisan commissions of the province, the decisions of the courts, it ignores the opinions of the vast majority of Nova Scotians who took the time to make representations before the committee and, like we said, the four members who dissented or signed the dissenting document, it is our belief the terms of reference for the Electoral Boundaries Commission should be sufficiently acceptable to all Parties represented in the House of Assembly and not just the members of the majority governing Party.</p>
<p>To take the politics out of it just a little bit - because I know it's like, oh yeah, well there's Chris talking about Argyle &#x2026;</p></speech>

There's the member for Argyle talking about the member for Argyle - that makes a lot more sense - just worried about his constituency. That couldn't be further from the truth, because after me there will be other people, who are going to want to represent the area and are going to want to be able to be the member for Argyle, whether they're from Pubnico, whether they're from East Pubnico, whether they're from Sluice Point, Quinan, Comeau's Hill, Wedgeport, Plymouth, Argyle and all the other communities that are held within my wonderful constituency.</p>
<p>We heard that from the youth who came and presented to the select committee and to the commission, youth who said someday I might want to be an MLA, I might want to be the MLA for Argyle. They will never have that chance anymore because that constituency has dramatically changed in size and in composition, and at some point the outcomes will be different in that constituency.</p>
<p>Madame la Pr&#xE9;sidente, je veux remercier tous ceux qui ont pris la chance de participer dans le processus, je veux remercier mes coll&#xE8;gues dans le caucus progressiste-conservateur et tout le monde qui supporte le fait que nos circonscriptions sont importantes, le fait fran&#xE7;ais.

<p>M. la Pr&#xE9;sidente, &#xE7;a va prendre du temps d'expliquer et de d&#xE9;battre &#xE7;a en cour, pour nos communaut&#xE9;s.

<p>UN MEMBRE HONORABLE : Comment est-ce qu'ils votent aussi? La moyenne, le pourcentage qui vote?&#xFFFD;</p>
<p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Bien, c'est &#xE7;a.</p>
<p>Ils ne vont pas oublier, les Acadiens de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, qui sont un peu partout et, principalement pour des raisons historiques que je ne vais pas commencer cet apr&#xE8;s-midi.

<p>I do want to talk about the process by which electoral boundaries are changed, because sometimes one gets the impression that we are making up this process here. The process - the House of Assembly Act clearly states how boundaries should be made. The government in its wisdom - many governments over many, many years - have decided via the House of Assembly Act that every 10 years electoral boundaries will be reviewed and revised. Nova Scotia is no different in that regard. All of the provinces and the federal government do it that way.</p>
<p>Electoral boundaries are revised based on the census, and they are revised largely to track and reflect population changes. We know that there have been dramatic shifts in population right across the country. We know that everywhere in the world, rural populations are being dislocated. They are being redefined, and there has been an urbanization of the population. Certainly the latest census is no different from other censuses that we have seen over the last several decades. Each decade the House of Assembly embarks on the process of responding to those population shifts, and this process was no different.</p>
<p>Every province in the country, including the federal government, sets terms of reference for a boundaries commission that goes out and responds to these shifts. Those terms of reference are virtually identical across the country. The first thing they do is to protect the principle of parity, the principle of equality, the principle that in a democracy every individual and every individual vote is equal. That principle of equality, Madam Speaker, is balanced by the recognition - it's particularly recognized in Canada, in all of the provinces and the federal government - that we have to have more than just equality, more than just parity. Even though parity is the cardinal principle, that parity has to be balanced against the principles of equity and being equitable.</p>
<p>In order to respond to that requirement, they established variances. Across the country, the highest variance is 25 per cent, and those were the terms of reference that were set - that there be parity of voting power and that there be a variance. The reason why we have this variance, Madam Speaker, is to respect diverse communities. It's to respect rural communities and respect the size of communities. We want to make sure that we have in our Legislatures the diversity that we need. We don't want to impose extraordinary burdens on individuals who are to be representatives of large constituencies. So we see in the terms of reference terms that are identical to terms of references across the country.</p>
<p>We want more Acadians. We want more African Nova Scotians. We want more women. We want people with disabilities. We want people from a wide variety - as wide a variety as we have in our province, Madam Speaker. I find it ironic that here we have a combined Opposition attacking a government that is the most diverse government in the history of this province. We have more women on this side; we have more women in the Cabinet. I myself, as I've said before, am the first Asian-Canadian who has ever been elected to this House. We've got African Nova Scotians. We've got people from every single region of the country here on this government's side, and we're being lectured to by two Opposition Parties that have not even pretended to incorporate diversity and the principles that they pretend to preach for.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we know the political Parties have the tools to promote diversity if they really wanted to and that is the way to do it.

The members opposite are saying those people are not Acadian. I'd like to know what test they're using to determine whether or not someone is Acadian. The point is that they have the tools and we are being diverse in areas that are not protected.</p>
<p>In any case, we respect the principle of parity of voting power and the variances there to make sure we have effective and equitable and fair representation for diverse groups of communities and rural Nova Scotians. The Boundaries Commission, in its final report, addresses these twin requirements that are in the terms of reference. They try to strike a balance between parity of voting power and effective representation. It's not an easy job, as we know, the Boundaries Commission travelled far and wide across the province and they came up with a report.</p>
<p>There is a lot that can be said about the process by which boundaries are set and perhaps the members opposite would like to review the House of Assembly Act to see if we can improve it. There is room for improvement there. The Boundaries Commission did go out and set out terms of reference and responded to terms of reference.</p>
<p>These Boundaries Commission reports - the Boundaries Commissions are established to remove this partisan political debate. (Interruptions) So the House of Assembly Act is structured in such a way to say that the commission reports to the government and the government then acts on that report. The final report of the Boundaries Commission essentially does that. The reason why the government transmits and essentially reports and acts as a conduit for the Boundaries Commission report is to avoid that kind of partisanship.</p>
<p>We have a majority government here. If we wanted to (Interruptions) If we wanted to be politically expedient, Mr. Speaker, and if any majority government wanted to be politically expedient, they could change the boundaries to suit their own purposes. I would love to have all these boundaries that are being shut down in Cape Breton, Cape Breton Nova - and Pictou was suggested as one of them, Shelburne is another. All of them are government constituencies and if a government in the future, if a majority government wanted to use its political power, it could change those political boundaries to protect its members.</p>
<p>We could do that if that's what the members opposite are saying we can do. That's why the political system has isolated and insulated boundaries commissions from that type of process. That's why this government, Mr. Speaker, is choosing to transmit the Electoral Boundaries Commission Report to us without major changes. Certainly we know what kind of major changes we would have liked to have made. We know if they exercised that power in the future, we know what future majority governments might do if we break with that precedent and say we are going to change those boundaries in a significant way.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this bill effectively transmits and acts as a conduit for the Electoral Boundaries Commission Report. I am delighted that the government has taken the high road and decided we are not going to do what we were going to do and introduce this bill as it is. It respects the spirit of the House of Assembly Act; it respects the principle of parity of voting power; it respects the principle of effective representation, it reflects the role of the Electoral Boundaries Commission and I'm happy to support this bill.</p></speech>

It truly has been a cultural enrichment for myself and indeed, the support the Black community shows me is well respected. It has been over 200 years that the Black community was trying to get representation in this Legislature. I want to commend the Parties in 1992 when they saw the foresight, unanimously, to create the Preston riding, to create the Acadian ridings that are so important.</p>
<p>Previously I represented the Chezzetcook area that had a tremendous amount of Acadians. I spoke in the Legislature about this before. The Acadians in the community were told, in my generation, not to speak French because you couldn't get a job - you couldn't get a job because you spoke French, my generation. Today we see this government with a totally flawed process. For political reasons, it appears - strongly appears - political reasons have taken the rights away of the African Nova Scotian community to elect who they want and the Acadian communities to elect who they want.</p>
<p>With the redistribution of boundaries in Preston, it will be almost virtually impossible for someone from African Nova Scotian descent to win the seat - very difficult now and indeed, my predecessor in our Party - Wayne Adams, whose picture is in this hall right here - made history when he was the first Black Nova Scotian ever to be elected in this place.</p></speech>

I'm very honoured to think that I'm the first person in history who has been re-elected in this riding three times. That has been largely to do with the fact that the Black community supports the work I do to help them and I really respect the privilege I do have to represent the community.</p>
<p>We've seen a very, very flawed system with political interference from this government. All the time I've spent in this Legislature, and I've spent - there are only two members in this House who have sat in this Legislature longer than me: one is from an Acadian riding and the other one is from Cape Breton - both from my Party - and this is the worst I have ever seen in this Legislature, the worst. They're taking the rights away of people in this province who have had a very difficult time in history, a very difficult time, and how can they say that they're truly representing this and this is the way it should be and justify what they're doing? You know, I sit here and watch the NDP, the former NDP members who were sitting in Opposition here, and they spoke very passionately about the rights of Nova Scotians. This government is taking that away.</p>
<p>It appears it's a political decision to do this. As was already mentioned by my colleagues here, none of the seats that are affected by this change, minority seats, are held by the NDP and that's not a coincidence - not a coincidence - and I think, as my honourable colleague from Cape Breton says, that probably after the next election there won't be very many NDP members left in this House. Hopefully that's the case; I truly hope that is the case for the sake of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It appears that this government has decided that they want to create more seats in metro where they have the most power and ability to get people elected. That's what it appears like. That's what the numbers show. That's what the redistribution appears like it was all about. It was interfered by the Minister of Justice and interfered by the Premier, indeed, to do these things and the people in Nova Scotia will judge, they will judge. I'm hearing a tremendous amount in the communities - not just from my own community but from outside the community - about how the system was, I would say, gerrymandered or interfered with, or whatever terms you want to use. People have all different opinions on that, but indeed the opinion is the same - it is the same - that indeed this is not healthy for Nova Scotia, it is not healthy.</p>
<p>It has only been a very few years that the minority groups in this province have seen the rights put forward that they have today and this is taking some of those rights away. It was very disappointing and, you know, we have to work together to ensure that the rights of individuals in this province are protected and improved upon. We have to. It has to be all of us who do that and that's what happened in 1992, all Parties did that. Unfortunately, this has been taken away and will be taken away today - today this will be taken away by this NDP Government. It's disgraceful, it is disgraceful.</p>
<p>I can speak on this much longer but unfortunately - you know, it's very passionate for me and it's very passionate for people in my community. I've had a lot of discussions with individuals in my community and groups and they're very disappointed in this government, and they're going to show it in the polls in the next election I'm sure - not just in my area but a lot of people of African Nova Scotian descent - they're all over this province. This government has refused to do an inquiry into the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children, it will affect the whole province, and I think it's all part of the process that this government has in place - very disappointing, absolutely very disappointing.</p>
<p>There was a lot of high hopes for this government when they were first elected to protect the rights of individuals and organizations, and indeed groups of individuals in this province, and that hasn't happened. Just the opposite has happened - it's very disappointing. I'm sure that that honourable member, Alexa McDonough, who was here before - and I knew her, I was here when she was here - would be very, very disappointed if she was in this Legislature today. But I can't speak for her, that's something she'll have to do herself - of course, she's very capable of that. Indeed these are not the goals and the objectives that this NDP Government had.</p>
<p>For years and years I sat here and listened many, many times, very intently, to the members who very passionately talked about the rights of individuals and minority groups in this Legislature, and indeed today a very big injustice has been done and will be done when this vote is carried today to take away those rights of Acadians, African Nova Scotians, and every other minority group in this province. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk on a subject that indeed will change the history of the Province of Nova Scotia - and I can't believe that a minister of that government would go on the way the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage did in this House.</p>
<p>We had a process, a process that was supposed to be independent. We had a process where we had individuals from across this province who care about the Province of Nova Scotia, who went out and listened to the people in the Province of Nova Scotia and came back with a report. That initial report is what they heard, and in that report it said that we should keep the minority seats.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, we heard from the member for Richmond earlier today about the words of the former Leader of the NDP, and one of the sitting members. They indeed believed in the process, they supported the process, and they saw the process move forward. The reason they did that was because they truly believed in democracy; they believed that was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>My constituency is next door the member for Richmond, and I have had a lot of dealings with that community - as a matter of fact I went to school in Richmond County. So I have a lot of friends there, and never once in all my time did I hear anyone say, gee, there are only 7,500 people here and there are 13,000 people there and that's not fair. What I did see was a community of interest, a community that worked together for the betterment of where they were, keeping their culture alive and moving forward on things that were important to their community.</p>
<p>Now as a result of the move of this government it has turned into a numbers game - a game where it's just about within the 25 per cent, and there are people who are going to be affected by this right across the province. They're going to be affected in a way that the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage says is fair. Well, he's not on the money on this one.</p>
<p>One of the things that is going to happen here that really has made me want to rise to my feet is, again, the Island of Cape Breton is going to lose a voice, and you know people need to have that voice - and people will say well the population is changing and people are moving out. But if you look at the numbers, we are justified in having that extra seat in Cape Breton. It has worked there all along - and how ironic it is that it happens to be a government seat that is going to be gone. Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact it's your seat that is going to be gone. And what is that going to do for the voices of the people in our area?</p>
<p>We listened to the government saying that this is the right thing for the people of Nova Scotia, but yet time after time, meeting after meeting, people came out and said this is not we want. To get 2,500 people to come to a meeting in Yarmouth in the middle of summer - is there not a message there? To get people to come out in Shelburne and say this is not what we want, we want to keep our community together, we want to keep our heritage together - which, by the way, is one of the guidelines and one of the principles of this whole procedure, that you take in community of interest and you should take into consideration the culture and what's taking place. And what has happened? It didn't suit the political needs of the government of the day, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>This government should be ashamed of themselves for putting their own interests ahead of the interests of the people of the Province of Nova Scotia, for taking the democratic process that we should be so proud of as leaders in the country of being the first elected Assembly outside of Westminster, celebrating 250 years of representative government, and here we are today about ready to vote on a bill to take that and tear it apart.</p>
<p>Recently we just celebrated Remembrance Day, Mr. Speaker, where we looked and paid tribute to the veterans, people who went to war to make sure that our rights and our freedoms were looked after. We paid great homage to them, and we should, but today we are now expected to vote on a bill that is going to squash some of those very freedoms. It's a sad day for Nova Scotia; it's a sad day for the Acadians, and it's a sad day for the African Nova Scotians. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#3b49aa8d-3e78-4679-b8f7-f3161f11d3a3"><from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from><p>I want to take this opportunity to say a few words about the House of Assembly Act, Bill No. 94. The last few weeks have been very difficult for the people of Shelburne County and, as do I, feel a strong attachment to the historical electoral boundaries, which is why the Electoral Boundaries Commission's decision to split up the county has been met with such resistance.</p>
<p>I have said this many times but I'll say it again, the decision for the commission to split up Shelburne County, without prior notice or consultation, blindsided the residents. I speak for each and every one of them when I say this, this is wrong. The commission failed Shelburne County.</p>
<p>That being said, the Electoral Boundaries Commission may have failed to engage the people of Shelburne County but our government did not. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the Committee on Law Amendments who travelled to Shelburne County over two days at the Sandy Point Community Centre, listening to almost 50 presentations, all calling to keep Shelburne County united. I am very proud that the only time on record that the Law Amendments Committee left Halifax was to appear in Shelburne County.</p>
<p>I think this action was very warranted, given the circumstances, and I once again want to thank the members from all Parties who took the time to hear what Shelburne County residents had to say on this issue. More importantly, I want to thank the residents of Shelburne County who appeared at the Committee on Law Amendments to have their say. I know a great deal of effort and organization went into the campaign to keep the communities that make up Shelburne County united. I want them to know that their efforts were not lost on their MLA and I dare say that in recent weeks the voices of other members of this House were definitely heard.</p>
<p>It is because of them that I am unable to support this legislation. The people of Shelburne County were unanimous in their call to keep the seat of Shelburne County intact and as their MLA I want them to know that I stand behind them. For 250 years, families in Shelburne County have elected someone to represent them in this Legislature. To put that into perspective, the people of Shelburne County have had a seat in this Legislature before Napoleon was even born. To the residents of Shelburne County, this legislation will mark a significant change in how they are governed. Given the choice, the people of Shelburne County would prefer if there were no change to their electoral boundaries.</p>
<p>That being said, I realize the boundary process is certainly a challenging one. An independent review of the boundaries is an important part of our democratic process, as is my right to stand in my place and oppose the recommendation for Shelburne County. Ultimately, my main complaint with the Electoral Boundaries Commission was that they did not - I repeat, did not - properly consult the people of Shelburne County, prior to making the decision. If anything can be learned from the past few weeks it is that this should not be allowed to happen again. The Electoral Boundaries Commission has an obligation to consult and engage with those communities most affected by their decision.</p>
<p>As I said before, I will not be supporting this legislation but I want the people of Shelburne County to know that even though this House of Assembly Act represents the end of an era, it also marks the beginning of a new one. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, each member of this House was not put here to represent electoral boundary lines, we were put here to represent the people and the families of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in Nova Scotia boundary lines are certainly all around us and are ever-changing. For example, at one time my hometown of Woods Harbour was in Yarmouth County. In earlier times, Yarmouth and Argyle were part of a much larger Shelburne County. Today the federal government is revising eight of the 11 current Nova Scotia ridings and at the municipal level, my hometown district was redrawn just last October. As a fisherman, I can personally witness many changes to our coastal zones. For example, a three-mile limit, a 12-mile limit and today Canada's 200-mile limit and in Atlantic Canada we boast of 41 lobster districts across the Atlantic zones. I just want to point out that fish do not respect boundary lines.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the point is that with time, communities change and, as a result, government must adapt. The current Shelburne electoral boundaries may have been in existence for 250 years but for many residents, the last three years have been the most positive. This was a common theme at the Law Amendments Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this government, the NDP Government accomplishments in Shelburne County since 2009. The building of Bay Side Home allowed more seniors to stay and live close to their homes, as has the elimination of security deposits from nursing homes.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we secured the safety of our fish stocks by extending the offshore drilling moratorium on Georges Bank and we've given new fish harvesters greater access to capital through the Fisheries Loan Board and we've helped our inshore fisheries stand up to Ottawa, protecting the owner/operator fleet separation policy. Most important, for the first time in decades, our NDP Government is reversing the tide of out-migration of our youth by investing in good jobs that will allow young people to stay, work and raise families in Shelburne County.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, at the Law Amendments Committee at Sandy Point, I heard over and over again the people point out the refurbishment of the Shelburne Shipyard and the creation of close to 400 new jobs by Cooke Aquaculture. These are all game changers for the young people of Shelburne County. These major job creators are a direct result of this government's commitment to creating good jobs in rural Nova Scotia. As a result, Shelburne County is on the cusp of returning to economic prosperity we haven't experienced &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, boundaries are just lines in the sand. I want the people of Shelburne County to know that a change in those lines will not change my, nor this government's commitment to making life better for the families in Shelburne County. Thank you for the time. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I have to say I'm rather sad today, seeing this bill come before the House and seeing what's going to happen as a result of this bill. My understanding - and perhaps I was a little naive coming into the House in 2009 - was that setting the boundaries was supposed to be an open and transparent process. What ensued, what happened here, doesn't pass the smell test.</p>
<p>On December 23<sup>rd</sup> we saw the government try to ram through terms of reference, and use its majority. Now, my understanding - and again, maybe I'm wrong, but what I had heard in the past was that all three Parties would get together and discuss the terms of reference, and they would agree on them. You would not have one Party or another ramming it through, shoving it down the throats of the other Parties. It would be a plan that was arrived at through a process that was civil and was respectful.</p>
<p>Calling members to come to a committee meeting for December 23<sup>rd</sup>, which didn't even get its work done because staff were leaving in the middle of the day and they had to defer it to the next week - that wasn't respectful. That wasn't a collaborative process. That didn't have the best interests of Nova Scotians at heart. What it was was an example of a government ramming something through, and they didn't give a hoot what anybody else thought. It was their way or the highway.</p>
<p>Again, a week later, same deal. They used their majority on that committee to determine the terms of reference, and the process was so offensive that - and I could be wrong on this, but my understanding is it's the first time in history that you had a dissenting opinion issued by the Opposition, who were adamant that these were not the appropriate terms of reference and they did not agree with them. The government did not care.</p>
<p>So the process gets underway and an independent commission is appointed, but that independent commission had a problem, because they were given two conflicting instructions. They were supposed to adhere to the terms of reference, but they were also supposed to listen to the people who presented to them. They had a choice. They could listen to the terms that the government rammed through, dictated, or they could listen to the people who appeared before them and they decided they would listen to the people who actually came out, the voters, the constituents who actually came out and spoke to the commission.</p>
<p>So what happened when that first interim report came out? Then Nova Scotia was treated to the spectre of the Minister of Justice coming out and interfering in what was supposed to be an independent process. It was not independent because that commission was not allowed to do what it thought was right, based on the fact that it was supposed to be listening to what it was hearing from people, and so we were treated to what I view as completely scandalous - the minister interfering in an independent process. Nova Scotians, I think, expect openness and accountability from their government and they haven't seen a whole lot of it from over there so maybe we shouldn't have been surprised.</p>
<p>The government didn't care. They just went ahead and rammed it through and they didn't even care when they made it plain for everybody to see that they were even willing to interfere in an independent process. So we are here today and what we see is the disappearance of four protected ridings, and those Acadian ridings had the highest turnouts for elections across the whole province. They took their right to vote very seriously and maybe that's why the government did away with them, but I have to say I am stunned to see the government do that.</p>
<p>Shelburne as a riding will not exist after this election. Cape Breton Nova as a riding will not exist at the next election. Antigonish has been tampered with, Queens, Digby, all across the board. But the government has only itself to blame for what happened. They decided to interfere. It was not done the way it is normally done and they will have to live with the consequences.</p>
<p>I understand their urge to want to make voter parity more paramount, but let's face it, in our particular system of government, this kind of thing exists all over the place. Look at Prince Edward Island, look at it federally, it has four seats with a population that is pretty much equal to one of our Halifax metro seats and yet it still exists and yes it's protected under the BNA Act or the Constitution Act, as it's now known, but the fact of the matter is very few people begrudge P.E.I. their seats. Do you know what? They have a really great turnout there. And do you know why? Because everybody knows their elected members and they know their candidates and maybe that was the secret to the Acadian ridings, why they had such great turnout there.</p>
<p>I have to say that today is probably one of the most profoundly disappointing days for me to be here in this House. I spoke a few days ago about the Transgender Persons Protection Act and how proud I was to be here to vote for that Act. I have to tell you how profoundly disturbed I am today to watch what happened here, to watch a government - the NDP - they were supposed to be on the side of people, that's what they always told us, and instead they just rammed through what they wanted and, Madam Speaker, I am really disappointed.</p>
<p>I understand that in my riding it may not be a huge deal about Acadian ridings. I have a lot of Acadians in my riding but I didn't have a whole lot of letters saying don't let them do this. But I will tell you what people don't like, no matter whether they're Acadian, whether they're Black, whether they are of Ukrainian-Canadian descent - like me - or whatever, what they don't like is when people use "might" as if it's right and that's what they did.

          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Madam Speaker, much has been said in this Chamber already, both in second reading, in committee, and again today, but I do just want to rise in my place for a few moments and talk about what is about to happen when the third reading vote finally takes place.</p>
<p>It's not going to be a proud moment in the history of this great province, because for the first time the electoral boundaries of the province are going to be drawn and enacted into law by only one Party - exclusively one Party. Not a single member of the Opposition that I know of in either Party or the Independent member plan to support the bill that is before us today.</p>
<p>What a shame for a province that prides itself on its democratic traditions, that something as important as drawing the rules of the game for the next election, as putting together communities of interest and making sure that their voices are heard in this Chamber, of determining the boundaries on which people will place their votes, of striking that important and right balance between parity of vote and effective representation - all of that will be determined exclusively by one political Party alone.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, if any Nova Scotian still wonders if the process was independent, as the government continues to maintain, if any single Nova Scotian wonders about the fiction that the NDP continues to create about the independence of this process, when that vote happens in a few minutes here today they will know for sure that this was not an independent process, that it didn't meet any of the tests of independence or fairness, and that one Party alone is carrying this to its awful conclusion.</p>
<p>When that vote comes, I hope all Nova Scotians see it for what it is, and that is a Party using its majority - a majority given to them by the people of Nova Scotia - not in a responsible way but in a very irresponsible way to force through rules that no one else agrees to, that no one else in this House agrees to. That many, many Nova Scotians spoke up in travels around the province, and in representations here, that they don't agree to. That is not consistent with the great traditions and history of this province, and it offends the&#xFFFD; common-sense values of Nova Scotians, and it offends the sense of fairness that Nova Scotians have and are known for here at home and around the world. That will be a dark moment when all that comes crashing home when the vote on third reading of Bill No. 94 happens in a few minutes. It didn't have to be this way. That's the great shame of it; it didn't have to be this way.</p>
<p>This House of Assembly appointed a select committee to draw up the terms of reference for an independent review as has been done in previous decades. That select committee went around the province as a committee of MLAs and it heard from the people of Nova Scotia. It heard many representations from Nova Scotians themselves about preserving communities of interest, respecting municipal boundaries where possible, of recognizing the importance of effective representation and not just parity of vote if we're going to have a House of Assembly that is as diverse and as articulate and as representative of the people as it can possibly be.</p>
<p>The NDP used their majority on that select committee to make a choice. They could have ensured that those terms of reference that select committee drew up reflected what the committee heard in its travels around the province, which was the will of Nova Scotians, or they could go with the will of their own Party alone. And when that moment came to choose between the people of the province and their wishes for this House and their own partisan wishes, they chose their Party, and they used their majority to make it happen. Madam Speaker, that was error number one that sent our province hurtling down this awful road that will come to this conclusion today.</p>
<p>I will point out again that at the time of the creation of that select committee, we did suggest, as an improvement on the way it had been done in the past, that all Parties be equally represented on that committee, so that whatever terms of reference are drawn up at least meet that test of fairness, that all three Parties that are officially-recognized Parties, that elect members to this House, have an equal say. It's a natural check on any one Party trying to use our electoral boundary process to get an advantage.</p>
<p>The defence of the NDP in rejecting it was that that's not the way it has been done before. For a Party that people thought they were voting for to get change, it was a bizarre defence, but that's what they said. They wanted to go with the old way and not have a new way. I will never understand why the Liberal Party also disagreed with that improvement. I hope that as they look back on the last few months that they will see it for what it is, and maybe one thing that can come out of this in the future is that we'll set the next review on the right foot by having a committee representative equally of all recognized Parties so that this can't happen again.</p>
<p>My main point, Madam Speaker, is that when given a choice as the majority on that select committee to choose to go with what people said in their presentations around the province or to go with their own partisan wishes, the NDP used their majority on that select committee to go with their partisan wishes. Would that have only been the first time in this awful process.</p>
<p>Then the independent commission was struck, and it too went around the province hearing the views of Nova Scotians - Nova Scotians from all walks of life. In fact, that commission itself was made up of some pretty distinguished Nova Scotians - men and women from all parts of our province volunteering their time to go and hear Nova Scotians' wishes on their electoral boundaries.</p>
<p>They had a lot of submissions, and it's in their first report how many submissions they had in writing, by e-mail, and verbally. That commission had terms of reference that said they were directed to be guided by the terms of reference, and they weighed that direction along with the representations that they heard. In that first interim report, that independent commission reported that, being guided by the terms of reference and wanting to be on the side of Nova Scotians themselves, they wrote a report that produced the first set of boundaries.</p>
<p>All seemed fine that day, Madam Speaker - that Nova Scotians' views had been heard, that an independent commission had done its work, had done its best to fit the twisted terms of reference of the NDP in with the views that they knew Nova Scotians had and expressed. I believe both of the Opposition Parties respected the independence of that first report - but not the governing Party.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Premier and the Cabinet of the NDP, the Minister of Justice was not happy. Again the NDP faced a choice - do we accept an independent commission that has listened around the province to the views of Nova Scotians from all parts of the province, from all walks of life, or do we force a change again that only advantages one Party? On behalf of the Premier and his government, the Minister of Justice threw out that first report and directed the independent commission to do their work all over again.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, that is offensive on many levels, but let me tell you one that I don't believe has been properly covered in this House, along with all the others that have already been described. The independent commission reported that when they first got the terms of reference, some of them were unclear and so they wrote to the Speaker of the Legislature to ask if there were any further direction before they began their work. This is reported on Page 20 of their final report. The Speaker of the Legislature, the Officer of this House, on behalf of all members, wrote to the committee that the terms of reference would be the final guidance from this House to that independent commission and that they use their own judgment from then on, which is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, Madam Speaker, that wasn't the final direction from a member of this House to that independent commission, as the Speaker on all of our behalf had told them it would be. After they did their work and produced their interim report, a member of this House took it upon himself to give further direction to that independent commission, an extreme form of further direction, and that is to write to them and tell them the report was not acceptable to that member and presumably when he did that he was speaking for the entire NDP Government and Party. Only the NDP said that that report was not acceptable.</p>
<p>That's the second time the majority Party had a chance to listen to what the will of the people and the independent commission had to say or to go with their own partisan means and they chose their own Party over the people, twice. That further pushed us down the road to where we are today. If there was any doubt after those two one-Party-only interventions that the independence of this process was thrown out the window, that did it. It was done and off we go.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, the independent commission instructed, wrongly, by the governing Party, to do their work over again. They did go around, got more opinions from Nova Scotians and produced a second interim report. Nobody knows better that the people of Yarmouth what that second independent report said. Then the independent commission went to Yarmouth to get their views - 2,500 people showed up at the Mariners Centre to give them their views.</p>
<p>&#xFFFD;At least they had a chance to have their say; at least there was a final report yet to come, when all of that was going on. And of course the people of Clare, Argyle, Richmond, Preston and others also had a chance to have their say both in the first interim report and the second interim report. The commission listened to those concerns before they produced their final report, put into the impossible position as independent commissioners - as everyday men and women of our province who are doing a service to Nova Scotia - between trying to incorporate the views that they knew they had heard from the people of this province with the constant interventions of the governing Party who had appointed them, and that's how we got to the final report.</p>
<p>So like an awful game of Russian roulette where there are so many bullets in the chamber and they keep firing, it is the people of Shelburne who are the last ones up, who saw the final report in total surprise realizing - not to mix metaphors - but, they were going to be the ones left holding the bag by this awful process, this process that now had lost any shred of independence. Madam Speaker, even worse, the people of Shelburne realized they don't even get a say. It's bad enough what happened to Yarmouth, it's bad enough what's happening to the protected seats, and it's bad enough that the NDP has already twice, by this point, interfered in an independent process. But for the people of Shelburne who had to endure all of those indignities, they also don't get a say.</p>
<p>I will say I feel very badly for the MLA for Shelburne. I don't believe that he wanted it to end this way. I know no one on this side of the House wanted it to end this way, and I don't believe he did either. I happen to have a lot of family in his riding, as he knows, and I will say that they say good things about him. They speak very highly of their MLA, and I respect that. I feel very badly that he has been put in the position he has been put in, because it is his own Party and his own government that set this process down this road. I'm sure he didn't foresee it would end this way, but somebody over there ought to have seen that the minute that a majority Party interferes in an independent process, you never know who's going to get left holding the bag. In this sad case, it is the people of Shelburne, and so I feel very badly about that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, they had a town hall meeting in Shelburne anyway, even though the process didn't allow for it. The member for Shelburne was there in Barrington at the high school. The MLA for Argyle was there. The Leader of the Liberal Party was there. I was there, along with about 400 other people - I think that was the number. They were very clear. They don't want to be left holding the bag. They don't want to have this happen to them, and they don't even get a chance to speak to a commission or any other official committee.</p>
<p>So we made the suggestion that the Law Amendments Committee go to Shelburne as the last chance to actually get a say in their own electoral fate, and I'm glad that that happened. That was the right thing to do, Madam Speaker, but having again heard from the people of Shelburne overwhelmingly about their wishes, the NDP had another chance to make a choice. They rejected all of the arguments that were put forward in Shelburne, and are plowing through on the same course of a process that lacks independence and that was fiddled with from the start, and that brings us to today.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I hope I added a few new twists to this twisted tale, because as I said a moment ago, shortly there will be a vote on Bill No. 94, and for the first time in this province's history, not a single member of the Opposition is going to support the way that the boundaries of the province are being redrawn. Only one Party is going to carry all of the weight of that moment when they vote yes to a process that has been unfair, unjust, and undemocratic and has nothing to do with independence.</p>
<p>Good luck, I say to the next government, the next House of Assembly who has to ask independent commissioners to give of their time and sit on a commission and do the right thing for the people of Nova Scotia. Good luck to whoever is in this House when that time comes. Hopefully when that next time comes, all members of this House together and all Parties together will do the right thing and draw up terms of reference that are truly independent, that are worthy of the support of all the Parties, because that's the only way we'll ever convince another panel of distinguished Nova Scotians to give of their time and do something right for their province, like be a truly independent commission and hear the views of Nova Scotians and report them back.</p>
<p>&#xFFFD;If they have any doubt that they are going to go down that road and have their independence kicked out from under them by one Party because it has the numbers to do it, we'll never have another set of volunteers to do that again. Mr. Speaker, that is another one of the shames of this whole thing. We had a group of independent commissioners willing to do a service to their province. I'm sure they're not going to report that they enjoyed this particular experience under this government</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, here we go. This sad tale, in this great province with its great democratic history, is going to come to its unfortunate conclusion in a few minutes when Nova Scotia makes history by having its electoral boundaries redrawn by the exclusive vote of only one Party and that is a real shame.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it has always been a case of great pride and privilege that I stand in this historic seat and represent the constituency of Yarmouth, an historic constituency that has always been represented in this Legislative Assembly. I'm the product of two very proud Yarmouthian families. I am the descendent of many generations of Churchills, who settled in Yarmouth from Brittany, and I'm also a third-generation Lebanese-Canadian, and proudly so, from my maternal side.</p>
<p>Being a member of a family who have played such an important role in Yarmouth's history but who have also faced the damaging impacts of racism and assimilation - as recently in the past as my mother's generation - I took great exception to the insensitive and ill-placed comments of the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage and I do ask him again publicly to apologize to this caucus for those words, and to the Lebanese community in this province.</p>
<p>One of my proudest moments as a Yarmouthian was the night of August 13<sup>th</sup> when over 2,500 community members came together for what was the largest public meeting in Nova Scotian history to express their disapproval, not just about the interim report that was published in June but about the entire process of this Electoral Boundaries Commission. That was a real defining moment for my community whereby we stood together and, specifically within the riding of Yarmouth, accomplished what we had set out to accomplish in keeping that historic riding together and intact, as it should be. Anyone who participated in that moment is still very, very excited about that experience and about what we accomplished together specifically within the riding of Yarmouth. Even Dr. MacNeil, the chair of the independent, or what used to be the independent commission, was very expressive about her appreciation around the level of respect that the people of Yarmouth showed the commission that night.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Speaker, the only objective of that meeting was not just to keep the riding of Yarmouth together but it was also to support our neighbours and our friends who live within our communities, specifically Acadians.</p>
<p>Moi, je peux parler fran&#xE7;ais, je peux comprendre le fran&#xE7;ais &#xE0; cause que j'avais des enseignants acadiens qui nous avaient enseign&#xE9;s en fran&#xE7;ais, dans le programme d'immersion &#xE0; Yarmouth. C'&#xE9;tait la deuxi&#xE8;me classe d'immersion &#xE0; Yarmouth et la raison qu'on avait &#xE7;a, c'&#xE9;tait &#xE0; cause que l'influence francophone dans notre communaut&#xE9;, l'influence acadienne. (Applaudissements)</p>
<p>I'm a very proud Yarmouthian and one of the reasons that I'm so proud of my area is because of the linguistic diversity. Growing up, I was the second immersion class in Yarmouth, and the reason that we have an immersion program in Yarmouth, and so Anglophone people like me are able to learn French and speak French, is because of the Acadian influence in our area, because of our neighbouring communities that play such an important role in our identity and in our economy. Today I stand with those communities in opposition to this bill as is presented because it fundamentally does eliminate protected ridings and rights that were given to very specific communities of interest in this Province of Nova Scotia, communities of interest that should be protected and have been protected until this NDP Government chose to insert themselves into what was supposed to be an independent process, and eliminate that status for those protected ridings.</p>
<p>This has been a process that has been flawed from the start. It has hurt a lot of communities, it has created a lot anxiety amongst many people, and it was not necessary. All that was required for this government to do was to stay out of it - to stay out of this process, to leave it be and allow an independent commission to do their work. And if that was the case, if this government did not intercede and impose its political will on that commission in a very, very forceful way, by telling them they were breaking the law - that's what was said by the Attorney General, he accused the commissioners of breaking the law - if it wasn't for that interference then we would still have, and proudly so, protected Acadian ridings, a protected African Nova Scotian riding, and the riding of Shelburne would still be intact, if it wasn't for the interference of this government, and that's a fact, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>In trying to understand why this government has acted in the way it has on this file is very confusing, and the only thing it can come down to is - I believe, and very sincerely - arrogance. We've seen this government act in a way that is not inclusive of other Parties, is not inclusive of stakeholders that disagree with their positions, and now we have this final result and it's because of that attitude, I think, which is why we've been brought to where we are today.</p>
<p>This did not have to be such a divisive process. If this Premier had taken the example of previous Premiers who included all Parties in the terms of reference, who sought the approval of the entire House of Assembly in setting their terms of reference because it impacts every region, every riding, and every Party - if we had a Premier that had taken that example we would have had a very different process here, one that we could all proudly stand behind tonight and support, potentially. As it is, we cannot do that and I do believe it's because, plain and simple, this is a government that has been driven in part by a certain level of arrogance, I think, that is unprecedented in this Legislative Assembly - at least since I've been around.</p>
<p>So today, although I know many members of my community are happy with the fact that Yarmouth was together - personally that is a relief to me to not have that constituency split up because it is a community of interest with a shared economy and with a shared history that is very distinct - as legislators I don't think we can take a selfish viewpoint on this legislation, and in my opinion this piece of legislation is destructive, it's divisive, and it has ignored the voices of very, very important people in this province, our Acadian population in particular, and reflects only the will of this Party, the New Democratic Party, and not the will, I think, of the majority of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I spoke at length on this bill in second reading, so I will be brief today, but the way even in which the Premier responded to criticism around this I think is unprecedented. We have a Premier who personally attacked a member of that independent commission - he was a volunteer who was trying to represent the interests of Acadians, of people from his area, and he simply disagreed with the final report. You know, we're allowed to disagree in a democracy; we do it every day in this Legislature - and to have a Premier act in such a way, to attack him personally and accuse him of being a troublemaker from day one, I think, was a real disservice to the process and I think it really shows how this Premier thinks on a lot of different issues.</p>
<p>I've experienced a lot, a certain attitude from this government where it's almost like members of this government believe that they are above criticism, they are above questioning, and that somehow it's an affront to all that's good in the world if members on the opposite benches get up and ask these critical questions and are critical of these decisions. I'm sorry, that's not the case. We are all allowed to criticize each other. We're allowed to engage in debate. We're allowed to disagree. Whether you like it or not, that's how democracy works.</p>
<p>I know it's this government's first term, so perhaps they're not used to being the recipients of such criticism, but I sat in this gallery for a long time when I was a student, and I listened to that Party in Opposition voraciously criticize past governments. So for them to think that they're somehow above that, I think is totally wrong, and I think it does come from a certain arrogance that exists in certain members over there.</p>
<p>That said, Mr. Speaker, this process isn't one that I can support. I do believe there's been a grave injustice done to our Acadian communities and to our democratic process. The number one lesson that I hope everyone takes from this is that our democracy is not as simple as a mathematical equation. If we've learned anything from this, I hope it's that. We have to take into consideration geography, communities of interest, and cultural and linguistic minorities - protecting one of the foundational languages in this province, the original language.</p>
<p>This bill does not do that. This government has not approached this in a way that has ensured equitable or fair representation. If the federal government did engage in a process that only looked at riding distribution in the way that this government does, P.E.I. would be without its representation that it currently has now and Nova Scotia would lose two seats in the House of Commons. I know there's no member on that side of the House of Assembly that will get up and say that Nova Scotia should lose two seats in the House of Commons, so why then apply that same logic and rationale to the provincial distribution of seats? It doesn't add up and it's unnecessary.</p>
<p>Again, this is a process that has hurt people, that has been divisive, and none of that needed to happen, Mr. Speaker. So I proudly stand with those Acadian communities that have been impacted, with the constituents of Shelburne, with the constituents in Cape Breton, and with all people who oppose this bill and feel hurt by it. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a5e0e841-506b-4c0b-a88e-c09691bd745b"><from>HON. MANNING MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise for a few moments to join the debate on Bill No. 94. I have to say at the outset that this was a sad decision for democracy in Nova Scotia. The Leader of the Progressive Conservatives was quite right that all Opposition members are going to be voting against this bill. It started out as an independent commission and was politicized by the government to the point where they picked the ridings they wanted. The Minister of Justice got involved early in the process and started the process going of what turned out to be a political process and not an independent process, to let the commission do its work without interference from the government.</p>
<p>Much has been said, Mr. Speaker, about the process here. Much has been said about the Acadian ridings that have been adversely affected by this government and also the riding of Preston for the African Nova Scotian population which has been adversely affected, but very little has been said about Cape Breton in this particular debate we're having around the boundaries.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when I came to this place almost 20 years ago, Cape Breton had 11 seats in the Nova Scotia Legislature. If this vote goes through today, Cape Breton will have eight seats in the provincial Legislature. I don't think the people of Cape Breton have been fairly treated by this government. There's been very little said about this government. I think it goes back again to politics. I think this government is so obsessed with the urban area of Halifax County here, where they have a large number of seats, that they think they can grow there and the Dexter bus has been very active, I believe, in throwing people under that bus in various other parts of this province.</p>
<p>Some members may not like that, but I think the very fact is that we're losing seats in Cape Breton, one seat, Cape Breton Nova is disappearing - your own seat, Mr. Speaker. I have to tell you that seat was a seat with a lot of history in Nova Scotia, over the years. It was well represented over the years by Percy "Pinkie" Guam from the Progressive Conservative Party for years, and then Paul MacEwan for many, many years and lately, Mr. Speaker, you have been representing that particular seat.</p>
<p>When I look at the multiculturalism that abounds in Whitney Pier and the kind of impact Whitney Pier has had in the cultural diversity of Cape Breton Island, it's hard to believe that this government has decided to abandon that particular riding. The Ashby part of that riding has been moved back and forth so many times now that - three times, the Speaker reminds me - that they don't know what riding they are in. I have to tell you when you make a case for representation by population, there have to be some other things brought into play here.</p>
<p>In the case of Cape Breton Island, we are hurting economically. We're still hurting economically, and all we get from this government is another loss of a member. We are now down to eight members on Cape Breton Island, out of a Legislature of 52, soon to be 51. I don't think the people of Cape Breton are being well served by this vote that is going to happen here later today or tomorrow, depending on how we get along the rest of the day debating this bill. I can tell you, I believe the commission that was put in place with Dr. Teresa MacNeil, an eminent Nova Scotian - her commission was, I think, disregarded by this government for political reasons.</p>
<p>I listened with intense interest to the member for Shelburne speaking about his riding. The optics here are actually beyond belief, what's happened here. The minister is still sitting over here as a Minister of the Crown, even though he disagrees with government policy, he's been allowed to do that. The minister has a scripted announcement today, tried to get into all the good things that have happened in Shelburne County under his watch. He was very well scripted on that but I have to tell you, the people of Shelburne must be wondering where that member is, because that member is still here but the constituency is disappearing and I would have thought that member would have sided 100 per cent with the people of his constituency and said I'm against this government policy so I'm stepping away from the Executive Council and let the people of that riding consider that in the next election.</p>
<p>But he didn't do that. What he said was, the Committee on Law Amendments came down and listened to the people of Shelburne. What happened? Nothing. It was an exercise to try to appease the member for that particular area. The government had no intentions of changing that report when the Committee on Law Amendments went down there - no intention, none. But they went down there and put on a show and came back and did absolutely nothing. They sold the people of Shelburne down the river, that's what this government did. They tried to make out that they were doing something for them and the minister representing that area stood by and let it happen.</p>
<p>What happens when the government came back and didn't do any changing of the bill in the Committee on Law Amendments or in Committee of the Whole House on Bills, I think it was at that time that the member should have said I've had enough of this Party, I'm stepping aside in favour of representing the people who sent me here. But he didn't do that. He didn't do that. He said in his remarks that he blamed the commission - not the government, but the commission. He said in his prepared statement that he blamed the commission and not the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it was the government. It was the government that didn't change that boundary. It was the government that changed the commission's report. As a matter of fact, I'm being reminded that the commission protected the riding in the first go around. But the minister has taken great pains to blame everybody else but his own government. I say to that minister that that minister should have stepped out of the Executive Council and stood by the people who sent him here. I'll tell you, Mr. Speaker, you stand with the people who sent you here, you don't stand with a government against policies you don't believe in. (Applause)</p>
<p>There's no question that we in Cape Breton are going to have less influence here in this House in the next Legislature because of the fact we're going to have one less member representing the important issues that face Cape Breton. That is a sad reflection on the way this has been going in terms of have-not areas of this province, and when you represent an area like I do, and like you do, Mr. Speaker, that has an unemployment rate in excess of 16 per cent, I believe the government should be paying more attention to that part of the province and not less attention by allowing less members to come to Halifax from Cape Breton Island.</p>
<p>I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this commission set out to do what was right and if they had been left alone with the complete independence that a commission of this kind should have, then I believe we would be sitting here, all of us, supporting this particular report that's here today. But we're going to vote against the report because it's more evident now than it ever was that this government is only concerned about political numbers, and they feel they have a better chance of getting what they want politically out of the people of Nova Scotia if they hand-pick the ridings that are going to be allowed to stand in the next election.</p>
<p>I believe that the member who, I believe, is one of the chief architects, the Minister of Culture and whatever else he represents - Culture and something, whatever else it is - the junior minister over there in any case, I think, had both hands in this mess around Christmastime last year when he decided to try to pull, what we call in Cape Breton, a "Hank Snow" at the last minute in favour of the government. But that minister, Mr. Speaker, is not smart enough to think of that himself. That came from One Government Place, he was merely the messenger. He was merely the messenger, and I believe he insulted everybody in this House earlier today, and I agree with the member for Yarmouth, that that member should be apologizing to the people of this House as well. (Applause)</p>
<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, the problem that member has is he's drowning in his own importance over there, and I believe that he not only owes an apology but if he's going to be the chief architect for this government as they move towards the next election, Heaven help the NDP in the next election. That's all I can say.</p>
<p>I refer again to the fact that we here in Cape Breton, and certainly I know, Mr. Speaker, you're very concerned about the fact that the Whitney Pier riding of Cape Breton Nova is going to be assimilated into three other ridings. While that is a concern to us that we're losing a member from Cape Breton Island in this House in the next Legislature, I don't think that's going to diminish the importance of the community of Whitney Pier or the community of Ashby, I believe that they're well entrenched in their multicultural activities there and the mosaic that they have, particularly in the Whitney Pier area, and as you know, Mr. Speaker, I represented that area when I was mayor in Sydney for 15 years and had the opportunity to coach Little League baseball in Whitney Pier. I know the member loves to get me talking about that - I don't know how successful I was, but the Police Atlantic Club Dodgers were a pretty good team at that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, Mr. Speaker, I think the area of Whitney Pier, I believe the commission took a look at the numbers, and in this particular respect if the government wanted to interfere with the entire process, they should have taken a look as well. You know, once they said that there was no more independence in the commission's report, then they should have taken a look at the value of keeping a certain number of seats representing the Island of Cape Breton. So now, again, when I started out by saying that we had 11 seats when I was first elected to this place, now we're down to eight seats, and I believe that Cape Bretoners are underrepresented in the House of Assembly here, and I believe that in some cases that hurts in order to try to get the government's attention for valuable programs that we do need in that part of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I'll say this as well, Mr. Speaker, when you look at what has happened to the Acadian seats here and what the government allowed to happen, it's no accident that all of these seats that are being tinkered with, I guess, or altered severely are all Opposition ridings. Now is that a coincidence that they just all happen to be Opposition ridings except (Interruption) I was getting to that - except Shelburne? I'm talking about the Acadian seats and the African Nova Scotian seat - the four protected seats.</p>
<p>The minister was quick to put his hand up over there fiercely representing his people of Shelburne, but if he was fiercely representing them he would have stepped out of Cabinet long ago and started representing them as an MLA down there, instead of trying to play both ends of the fence. And that's what he's trying to do. He's trying to make out that he really cares about the people down there yet he's staying in Cabinet, and as a result - and I've seen this happen before, I've been a Cabinet Minister. No Cabinet Minister is given permission to vote against a government bill or policy unless they step outside the Cabinet, but this Premier obviously either doesn't control this Cabinet or this Cabinet does not (Interruption)</p>
<p>You know, the Minister of Justice is an expert now on this, I guess. He has sat in Cabinet for a couple of years and he's an expert, but I can tell you that Cabinet solidarity is important and government policy is important but if you're in Cabinet and you can't abide by the rules or the decisions made by the government, you step outside the Executive Council and stand with the people that you represent, who sent you here. (Applause)</p>
<p>I feel very badly about the fact that I'm going to be voting against this bill today because in the past it was always a bill that was determined by the entire makeup of the House of Assembly. I can remember the last boundaries change 10 years ago. My riding changed and I accepted that, then 10 years before that it changed and I accepted that, and the previous member accepted it. But there were slight alterations in boundaries to create a more equitable distribution of voters in those ridings. It wasn't the wholesale dissolution of protected ridings and also the problems created with reducing numbers of seats in various parts of the province, particularly in my case and in your case, Mr. Speaker, on the Island of Cape Breton. We now have less representation here than we did when I first came here, three seats less than that, and that is not good for the future representation of the people of Cape Breton Island in this Legislature.</p>
<p>However, Halifax is gaining a couple more seats because of population and one can say, yes, there can be arguments on both sides that there should be less members - there are people out there who are saying we have too many members in the first place, that we should be down to around 36 members, some say 40. But here we are, we made a big change and reduced it from 52 to 51, and that's a start. By the time the next century rolls around we may get back to taking a closer look at, do we really need the number of MLAs that we do have? The proportion of distribution of those members, I believe, is not a distribution that favours parts of this province, such as Cape Breton Island and certainly other parts of the province as well.</p>
<p>I was particularly pleased to hear the member for Yarmouth so passionately talk about his area, with all of the economic problems that he has had over the past few years. But he's standing tall for the people of Yarmouth, he's standing tall for them and has done so in this Legislature right through this piece. Even to the point where he didn't stand silent when the Boundaries Commission visited his area, he didn't hide, he made his feelings known right then and there, because he knew something was going on and he moved to stop it, and indeed he was one of the catalysts that did stop it. So I congratulate the member for Yarmouth for sticking up for his constituents.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am going to take my seat in a moment but I'm going to say that I never thought that we'd be standing here today debating a boundaries bill and having the Leader of the Progressive Conservatives say that both Parties are together voting against this particular bill. I agree that this bill is flawed. I agree this bill has been hijacked by the government from day one, for political purposes, for political purposes only. That's a sad day when you take a commission like the one we had, the esteemed Dr. Teresa MacNeil and her commission, and what this government has done is said there is no more independence. You're an independent commission starting out but the minute we don't like what you're saying, you're no more an independent commission.</p>
<p>That is what happened. This government jumped in politically with both feet and it came from One Government Place. Whoever is doing the spin doctoring for this Premier and this government, I suggest that he should get some new people because the way this government is going, by the time the next election comes, they won't be at 29 per cent in the polls, they will be at 9 per cent. Thank you.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it was interesting listening to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. I hope he goes back to reflect on his comments. He asked the question, how do you define an Acadian? Then he went on to criticize the Opposition Parties for not having representation of minorities, despite the fact that this caucus includes a member of Lebanese descent, a Ukrainian-Canadian, two Acadians. He said that the Liberal caucus hadn't nominated Black candidates. He should speak to the Premier and ask him who ran against him. I think Mr. Ince would be surprised to learn the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage does not consider him to be a Black Nova Scotian. (Applause)</p>
<p>He said if the government was hijacking the process with their majority, they would rejig the boundaries to save various members - I don't remember his exact words, something like that. There is no boundary big enough to save most of the members in the NDP caucus these days, based on the decisions they've made. That would be one heck of a riding.</p>
<p>He talks about independence in the House of Assembly Act, which this flows out of, there is a whole section that talks about the commission being independent. It talks about the structure of the select committee that establishes the terms of reference and how that select committee, in the Act, is determined like other committees, the same balance, and so the government gets the majority because that's the way committees are established in the Legislature; that's in the Act.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this process, we said that's fine. We want the rules to be followed and that was part of the rules. Others tried to make a political point but didn't actually introduce an amendment, just tried to have a political stunt which would have violated the House of Assembly Act, if in fact that had gone ahead at the time.</p>
<p>But we moved ahead and in our very first meeting we sat around, members of all Parties, and we thought this would move forward. It's interesting that in the commission's final report on Page 5 they wrote to the Speaker because they felt maybe there was not some clarity around the terms of reference. You, Mr. Speaker, wrote back - and I hope you will allow me to use the word 'you' in referring to you. You wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"&#x2026; the terms of reference established in the Report of the Select Committee constitute the totality of direction to the Commission and no person or body is authorized to give further direction (subject to any further direction from the House of Assembly)." </blockquote>
<p>I will table that, Mr. Speaker - that was direction from you to the commission when they asked. I'm sure you can imagine the commission's surprise when their first interim report is rejected by the Minister of Justice in a letter where he says, "As such, I would request that the Commission prepare a revised interim report that complies with the terms of reference."</p>
<p>I will table that letter from the Minister of Justice. That's after, Mr. Speaker, you wrote the commission telling them that there is no person or body that has the right to give them additional direction. In fact, it wasn't that they disagreed with the terms of reference. It wasn't that at all. It was that they read them, they travelled the province and listened to various interpretations, and they decided that they would interpret the direction in their own way. I will table that, too. I will table their direction.</p>
<p>We'll come to a vote on this shortly, I assume. At the end of the day, the commission did their job. It's interesting - as a member of the select committee, I travelled the province with the other members, and we heard very loud and clear what Nova Scotians wanted. If there was any doubt about that, the commission travelled the province and got submissions and heard the same thing. That's what resulted in their first interim report - they heard the same thing, Mr. Speaker. What they heard was that people felt that protecting those ridings was important.</p>
<p>That shouldn't be surprising, because Jean L&#xE9;ger, who is - or was, I guess he isn't now - the executive director of la F&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration acadienne de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, had brought to the commission's attention something which had been brought up in many of the previous commission reports. He brought up a ruling of the Supreme Court that talked about Section 3 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, one of the things that defines us as Canadians, one of the things that, regardless of Party, we celebrate as saying this is part of what makes Canada, Canada.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said the province is empowered by convention to establish electoral boundaries, but that convention is subject to Section 3 of the Charter. "The content of the <i>Charter</i> right to vote is to be determined in a broad and purposive way, having regard to historical and social context. The broader philosophy underlying the historical development of the right to vote must be sought and practical considerations, such as social and physical geography, must be borne in mind." I'll table that.</p>
<p>They went on to talk about the idea of effective representation. They talked about the fact that effective representation is as important as truly exact, one-to-one representation. They said that's just as important because you have minorities, you have cultural groups in this country which have been disadvantaged because of the historical and social context, and deserve and demand in our Legislatures the appropriate representation.</p>
<p>I think we all know what that history is in Nova Scotia as it relates to Acadians. I think we all know what that history is as it relates to Black Nova Scotians. Certainly the former NDP MLA for Preston knew when she said, "I always saw the New Democrats as a progressive Party and this Act is regressive," and "To me, it's just taking something else away from the Black community." I'll table that as well. That was the former NDP MLA for Preston. She knows that at the moment Preston isn't represented by someone whose skin colour is black, but she still felt that was important because she recognizes that it's not about the person.</p>
<p>Finally, much of what I've had to say on this I've said over the past while, so just a last couple of comments. Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage - and I truly do hope that he reflects on his comments - talked about not nominating an African Nova Scotian candidate. He was wrong on that, but I think he might want to check who the NDP nominated in Richmond and in Argyle for those Acadian seats (Interruption) and in Preston, I guess, apparently. He might want to just check on that history, because those in glass houses really shouldn't throw stones.</p>
<p>That might be an overused statement, but the minister stood up and made - I mean, he must have gone off-script, I guess. It's like the member for Pictou East the other day, you know, when they don't read their notes.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it has been about a year now since Nova Scotians have been put through what has been an extremely difficult process. I have stood in my place in this House and have spoken a number of times on this bill and about the division that has been created by this bill, but I think it's important to go back to where we started, which was back in December of last year, December 2011, when we put together a group of select members of this House representing two members of our caucus, two members of the Progressive Conservative caucus, and five members of the governing Party, to kind of put together terms of reference that would guide the Nova Scotians who were chosen to represent us in the deliberations and how they engage Nova Scotians about what the electoral boundaries should look like.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, recognizing that after having gone through this process two different times, I think most people know that it would be difficult when you go into communities and you start talking about changing electoral boundaries, about moving people in and out of particular ridings, but I know last December the members of our caucus, the member for Richmond and the member for Dartmouth East, and the member for Argyle in the Progressive Conservative caucus and the member for Victoria-The Lakes in the Progressive Conservative caucus, raised serious concerns.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when you go back and look at the terms of reference that were set for Bill No. 94, there's a dissenting report in that terms of reference and the dissenting report is really surrounded around Clause 2(d) because it went against minority rights in the Province of Nova Scotia. What's really important, in 1992 and in 2002, if you actually read the terms of reference for both of those reports, they are almost identical except Clause 2(d) but what it really said to the commissioners who were chosen in 1992 and in 2002, we're giving you the ability, the flexibility, to go out and listen to Nova Scotians and respond to what you hear. We're giving you the ability to protect minority ridings in the Province of Nova Scotia. We're giving you the ability to ensure that cultural and linguistic communities have a voice in the Nova Scotia Legislature. It never said you had to, it said we're going to give you the right and the ability and the flexibility to respond to what Nova Scotians are saying.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after going through this process last December, we then went out and engaged an impressive group of Nova Scotians, some of whom have had experience before - some were involved in the 2002 review, and some were new. All of them accepted the request from government to participate with the understanding that they would have independence. They read the terms of reference and they went out and, as you know - it has been discussed here a number of times - they actually sent a letter to you and you responded that the terms of reference were the final thing.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, lo and behold, they embark on what is always a very difficult situation when you go into communities and suggest that we're going to have to look at dividing boundaries, changing boundary lines, but they embarked on that mission in good faith. They went out and they listened to Nova Scotians, and Nova Scotians from one end of this province to the other responded. They showed up passionately describing and telling why they believed that their individual communities should either be protected or why certain communities belonged together in the Province of Nova Scotia. The commission listened and they delivered an interim report. It's really, truly, the only independent report of the Electoral Boundaries Commission that we've seen so far.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, they went out and they listened and they said - Nova Scotians said -&#xFFFD; we want minority rights protected in the Province of Nova Scotia. We see the value. We see what a difference it has made to the House of Assembly.</p>
<p>The member for Argyle, who happens to hold that seat now but his predecessor who was in here was the Minister of Finance; the member for Clare, who has been in Cabinet; the member for Richmond, who has also been in Cabinet; the member for Preston, who has also been in Cabinet, representing minority rights; they've seen what has happened when their voices at the Cabinet Table - someone who is representing their linguistic and cultural differences, Mr. Speaker, someone who is protecting minority rights in the Province of Nova Scotia, they wanted those rights protected. The commission listened and said, you know what? We like the makeup of the House of Assembly today because it's what Nova Scotians see as a reflection of who they are.</p>
<p>We were very encouraged by that. I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, there were parts of that interim report, minority changes in boundaries here or there, that would have been on the final go-around that people would have had a turn to express their concerns. But by and large, Nova Scotians were proud of the fact that hardworking Nova Scotians accepted the task in this government and then responded by protecting minority rights. It was only when the Minister of Justice responded to the call from the Premier to tell those Nova Scotians to ignore what they heard as they were travelling around, to tell the committee to ignore what Nova Scotians told you; only listen to what One Government Place says.</p>
<p>One Government Place said minority rights don't matter, communities of interest don't matter. The only thing that matters is population. Mr. Speaker, when you focus solely on population, you end up having happen to Shelburne what happens to communities.</p>
<p>What did the government believe would happen? What did the member for Shelburne believe would happen if you stopped protecting minority rights on the west side of him? What did he believe was going to happen to Argyle? Or did he think the people from Argyle were going to get representation because the government didn't believe they should have their own representation?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, he's quite right, the committee did not go to Shelburne. The committee has not been in Digby either and that constituency has been changed, drastically, without hearing from the select committee. I will say that the member for Digby-Annapolis did speak to that select committee about the challenges facing his constituency because he saw what was coming. He saw that when the government of the day, when the Justice Minister said to this committee, go back, start over again, ignore minority rights, ignore communities of interest, only focus on population; he knew his community was going to be affected in a way that wasn't positive to them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if you go back and look at the terms of reference that were set, if you look at this whole process over the entire year, we've ended up here today with the elimination of protected ridings for one reason, it's because that's what the NDP Government wanted. There's no other way around it. At every turn, every time something happened, they interfered. They undermined the independence of this commission by going back and telling them to redraw the position.</p>
<p>We are here in this House now, going to be voting on a bill that will eliminate minority rights in the Province of Nova Scotia. I don't think any member of the House should feel good about that, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I said when I was in second reading, my mother is from Richmond County, Cape Breton. My mother is a Mombourquette, of Acadian descent. I'm somewhat poorer for the fact, quite frankly, that the language has not been passed on to me. I hope my children will pick up my part of my family lineage and pick up the Acadian language.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Acadian communities across this province were represented well in this House by their protected ridings and by the members who represented them. I think as a province, by the passing of this piece of legislation, we are all the poorer for it. (Applause) I'm not sure why we proceeded and rushed this bill through when the terms of reference - and why the government wanted to proceed last Fall. If you actually read what has been in legislation for quite some time, the select committee actually only had to be put in place today. It didn't have to report by December 31, 2012. We just had to select the members who were going to sit on that committee. They could have taken the next year or two years to report back to this House and had a full airing of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>That would have probably been the correct thing to do: giving the commission the flexibility that the two previous commissions have had, to be able to listen to Nova Scotians and to be able to respond to their desires and their wishes on the makeup of this House. I was hoping that at some point the government might listen to that and extend this to allow that to take place. We don't have to vote on it in this session. We could actually hear from Nova Scotians again, or listen to what they've actually said to us in the first place. But that's not what we're going to do. This bill's going to come for a vote here very soon.</p>
<p>I am extremely proud of the work that has taken place by my colleagues in the Liberal caucus. I am extremely proud to have been and to be their Leader. I'm extremely proud of the way all members of this caucus have stood by my Acadian colleagues and by the member who represents Preston, by standing with them to ensure that minority rights are protected.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't say a few words on the comments made by the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. I hope at some point he reflects on those words. It was not only offensive to members of this House, members of the Acadian community, and the African Nova Scotian community. It was offensive to women and to all minorities in the Province of Nova Scotia. I take great exception, as a Leader of a political Party who takes great pride in the diversity of his caucus, in the diversity of his Party, and in the diversity of the community that I represent, that in any way that minister would think that a son of a widowed mother who raised us would in any way discriminate against the rights of any minority or any female member. It is unacceptable. (Applause)</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if he would apologize to every minority in the Province of Nova Scotia and if he would apologize to every female member, not only of this House, but every woman in this province for his remarks. The fact that he would stand up the way he just did and not come clean to apologize is beyond me.</p>
<p>It highlights why we're here. It highlights why that caucus has trampled on minority rights in the Province of Nova Scotia, when you have a member sitting at the Cabinet Table who would stand in this House and go on like he did and then stand up and not be willing to apologize. It highlights why we are where we are, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#5c3f8e78-5002-4c61-9c57-730090867f1b"><from>HON. WAYNE GAUDET</from><p>Merci, M. le Pr&#xE9;sident. Lors du d&#xE9;bat sur le projet de loi 94, en deuxi&#xE8;me lecture, j'ai indiqu&#xE9; que le r&#xF4;le du gouvernement NPD a &#xE9;t&#xE9; tr&#xE8;s autoritaire. Le gouvernement n'a pas &#xE9;cout&#xE9; la population acadienne de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated during the debate on second reading of Bill No. 94 the NDP Government from the start of this electoral boundaries review that started back a year ago was heavy-handed all through. At every step of the electoral boundaries review the NDP Government did not take into consideration the will of the people. The people of Clare expressed their view loud and clear and stated please maintain the four protected ridings of Clare, Argyle, Richmond and Preston. Lo and behold what did the NDP Government do? Well, just the opposite, let's eliminate the four protected ridings of Preston, Richmond, Argyle and Clare. According to the NDP Government, the four protected ridings did not have the magic number of voters. The NDP did not accept the fact that other factors must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, back on New Year's Eve last year the headlines of the ChronicleHerald read, and I have a copy here because I used this in second reading, the headline read, Acadian and Black seats lose protection, this is one year ago. I don't know if this, as I indicated during second reading, I remember when I first read the headline on the paper that morning if this was a New Year's resolution for the NDP Government to eliminate the four protected ridings but I guess we're right down to the wire that we truly understand, right through this whole process exactly what the NDP Government had in mind to do.</p>
<p>At every step of the process, and the records show this and members, my colleagues here in the House, have time and time again showed through you, Mr. Speaker, exactly the interference that the government did right along the process. Why? Because the NDP Government have the majority government, today they have a majority government and they felt they don't have to listen to what people of Nova Scotia have to say. The government can try to blame the special committee of the House for setting the terms of reference for the commission, but we all know it's the NDP Government that dictated the terms of reference for the commission.</p>
<p>The NDP Government had a minority on this select committee. It didn't matter what the duly elected Opposition members on this committee had to say, they had a majority. The NDP members decided the terms of reference to reflect the will of the NDP Government. There was no discussion, no debate; the terms of reference were designed to eliminate the four protected seats.</p>
<p>Right through this boundary review we heard the NDP Government members talking about vote parity and nothing else but vote parity. According to the NDP no other factors should be considered and, Madam Speaker, this is wrong. So why did the provincial NDP Government decide to neglect all other factors by imposing the notwithstanding clause in the terms of reference? This 25 per cent variance imposed by the NDP Government made it impossible for the Electoral Boundaries Commission to consider any other factors in determining the future of these four protected ridings. Even with the 25 per cent guideline the Electoral Boundaries Commission recommended keeping the four protected seats.</p>
<p>Before the Electoral Boundaries Commission started their public consultation, the commission themselves were handcuffed and this was done on purpose. The NDP Government decided back on New Year's Eve last year, 2011, what was going to happen to the riding of Clare and the other three protected seats. Now here we are: the government has fulfilled their New Year's resolution by no more allowing these protected ridings to exist in our province.</p>
<p>This was a done deal before the commission got on the road and started its public consultation. As I indicated, before the commission actually started their consultation, The ChronicleHerald, Saturday, December 31, 2011, the headline: Acadian, black seats lose protection. I think a lot of people who read this didn't believe it, but I guess looking back at the last 12 months and here we are tonight, just a few minutes away from this important vote, this was a done deal before the commission got on the road and started its public consultation.</p>
<p>Back in April the commission came to Clare for a public hearing and the people of Clare strongly expressed their view to the commission. The people of Clare attended, in large number, a public meeting at the Clare Legion to prepare for the visit of the commission coming to Clare back in April. The commission's first - you know there have been so many interim reports and government interference, people certainly get lost when you go back and try to reflect on what action, what happened, when did it happen, who said what, there has been lots.</p>
<p>The commission's first interim report, I can tell you, was greatly appreciated by the people of Clare because it reflected their will, reflected what they had a chance to tell the commission that night. But as we all know the good news didn't last too long once the Attorney General stepped into the work of the so-called independent commission and declared the commission's work null and void. Well, the intervention by the Attorney General certainly caused - and I say caused - an uproar throughout Clare, and that is putting it mildly. The Attorney General's intervention certainly caused an uproar throughout the Acadian community and across our province.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see members of the commission stay on. As a matter of fact, I was really surprised, and I wasn't the only one. A lot of people could not believe that the commissioners, after being told by the Attorney General, decided to stay on and try again. I think everybody, everybody, was surprised. I understood that the commission must have had some really difficult decisions before arriving into continuing their work.</p>
<p>However, in their second report, the commission proposed major changes for the four protected ridings. Then on September 25, 2012, the commission filed its final report recommending the elimination of the Clare constituency, and the people of Clare found it extremely unacceptable. Under Bill No. 94, it is proposed that Clare and Digby will be combined into one riding. This is not the extension of Clare into Digby. This is the elimination of the Clare riding. It dilutes the Clare riding into the Digby riding.</p>
<p>So in closing, the NDP Government has designed the outcome of this independent boundary review from the word go. The so-called, apparent, public consultation, done by the special select committee of the House, done by the Electoral Boundaries Commission, was a mockery of democracy. Why? Because it didn't take the will of the people into consideration.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the four protected ridings was not done within an open debate, which is warranted on this fundamental question. This has been a top-down decision imposed by the NDP Government - imposed on the special select committee, imposed on the Electoral Boundaries Commission, imposed on the Acadians throughout Nova Scotia, imposed on the people of Nova Scotia, and imposed on the people of Clare.</p>
<p>I report to you, Madam Speaker, that the people of Clare are highly upset. We're writing history tonight. History will blame this NDP Government for the elimination of the Clare riding that has existed for many years.</p>
<p>Madame la Pr&#xE9;sidente, l'histoire de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse va indiquer que le Nouveau Parti d&#xE9;mocratique de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse a &#xE9;t&#xE9; le gouvernement qui a &#xE9;limin&#xE9; les circonscriptions acadiennes d'Argyle, de Richmond et de Clare.</p>
<p>Un dernier mot : je d&#xE9;sire donner un remerciement sp&#xE9;cial &#xE0; toute la communaut&#xE9; acadienne et francophone pour leur participation tout au long du processus de la r&#xE9;vision des fronti&#xE8;res des circonscriptions &#xE9;lectorales.</p>
