<p>Whereas seniors and other vulnerable people rely on home care workers to provide invaluable services that are a vital part of our health care system; and</p>
<p>Whereas home care workers deserve to be treated fairly, paid fairly, and have a fair resolution to contract disputes; and</p>
<p>Whereas the Liberal Government has mismanaged the collective bargaining process with home care workers and left thousands of families frustrated and worried that their loved ones won't get the care they need;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House agree to adopt a method of resolving contract disputes in health care that doesn't cause worry, hardship, and service disruption for vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I request waiver of notice and passage without debate.</p></speech>

<p>&#xFFFD;I hereby give notice that on a future day I shall move the adoption of the following resolution:</p>
<p>Whereas Loretta Saunders was a bright and enthusiastic 26-year-old student attending Saint Mary's University in Halifax; and</p>
<p>Whereas originally from Labrador, Loretta was working towards her Master's Degree in Sociology, writing her thesis on a topic she cared passionately about; and</p>
<p>Whereas Loretta's disappearance on February 13<sup>th</sup> of this year led to a fusion of support and awareness for missing Aboriginal women in this province and across Canada;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Loretta Saunders, and resolve to support all efforts to examine and understand more fully what steps must be taken to end the unacceptable rate of death and disappearance among Aboriginal women in Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I request waiver of notice and passage without debate.</p></speech>
