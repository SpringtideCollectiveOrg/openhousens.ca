<p>Whereas at just 16 years old, Cape Breton resident Joe Shannon jumped into the business world with only a dump truck and determination, and built an empire of successful Nova Scotia companies; and</p>
<p>Whereas Mr. Shannon used his success to become one of the province's great philanthropists, giving back to his community by mentoring young people, supporting Cape Breton University, and donating to a variety of initiatives; and</p>
<p>Whereas Mr. Shannon, who still resides in the Strait area, has been recognized for his generosity and achievements by being the only Nova Scotian appointed to the Order of Canada this year;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that members of the House of Assembly congratulate Joe Shannon on being invested into the Order of Canada, and thank him for his tireless efforts to make Nova Scotia a better place.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I request waiver of notice and passage without debate.</p></speech>

            <from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the member brings up an issue here that in the questioning there was information that was led by the questioner, and then the respondent - that was information that was public before that. It was in the public domain before the minister had responded. With those few comments I would like, when you make your decision, to have that in mind - that this was public knowledge before the minister responded. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in bringing up the question yesterday, number one, I did have permission from the mother and from the client in question. Number two, the information that the minister did offer up was not in the public domain before Question Period that day, and was not in my question as well. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>I will take the point of order under advisement, and I will report back to the House at my earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Before we begin the daily routine, the topic for late debate has been submitted by the member for Bedford-Birch Cove:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Premier, while in Opposition, called user fee hikes "across the board tax increases" but turned around and hiked 1,400 user fees and Nova Scotians are fully expecting the Minister of Finance to hike user fees late this afternoon, further squeezing Nova Scotians and making life even less affordable under the NDP.</p></speech>

<p>Whereas November is Financial Literacy Month in Canada, organized by the Financial Literacy Action Group; and</p>
<p>Whereas this wonderful initiative recognizes the need and importance of financial literacy in our country and encourages Canadians to make responsible financial decisions; and</p>
<p>Whereas many Canadians observed this month by taking the opportunity to become more engaged in their finances and by educating themselves to increase their skills and confidence;</p>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, over the past three years the Premier has lost credibility when it comes to financial management. We know that his budget last year overstated revenue by $27 million. This was more than an error. It was a conscious effort to make the numbers match the storyline instead.</p>
<p>When it comes to the management of the province's finances, the Premier has shown - time and time again - fiction after fiction. So why should Nova Scotians expect anything different next week?</p></speech>

DARRELL DEXTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what this government has demonstrated is some of the best financial management practices that the Government of Nova Scotia has ever seen. In fact, we have changed past practices to reflect greater transparency. We have done more in the way of multi-year budgeting. We have set targets and met them. We have ensured that the expenditures made by our departments consistently come in under budget.</p>
<p>That is the record of this government. It is a good one and we are proud of it.</p></speech>

<p>The reality is that this is the job we have. We are supplying the services that the people of this province require, because this government is about the people. This is about ensuring that they get what they need in order to be able to live lives of dignity, in order to make sure that young people are able to get a job when they need one, and in order to make sure that the children who go to our schools get the education they need. That is the job of the Government of Nova Scotia. We are doing it, and we're doing it within the financial ability that the province has.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the job of the government, and indeed any Nova Scotian, is to be open and honest and truthful. When you knew there was a mistake in last year's budget and yet you stood in this House and allowed that myth to continue, and continue for a year, and only pointed out by the Auditor General, it speaks to the arrogance and credibility of this government.</p>
<p>There isn't a single employer in the Province of Nova Scotia who wouldn't fire an employee who misled them. My question for the Premier is, did he fire the former Finance Minister, or did the former Finance Minister quit after tabling a budget he knew had a $27 million error?</p></speech>

<p>Last year, we called for her resignation over her handling of the Talbot House file and her department's public and personal dismissal of the respected executive director. Of course she refused at that time but shortly after, the Premier took away her responsibility for that file and Addiction Services. The minister was caught up in multiple flip-flops about the fate of private daycares, and earlier this week, in the Speech from the Throne, it appears the Premier took that responsibility away from her too.</p>
<p>So I will ask the Premier, will he remove the minister from Cabinet for this shocking breach of confidentiality, or will he merely take away her responsibility for all her client files, one by one, until she has none left?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House I reviewed the information that was provided by the minister, and I have to say, I've often thought that the questions that get asked are difficult ones for any minister. It's particularly difficult for ministers with portfolios like the Department of Community Services. I found the answer that the minister gave in relation to that file to be compassionate, to be understanding, and trying to address what is a very serious issue, and she did so. I think that was entirely appropriate.</p>

The NDP have claimed again yesterday that the Muskrat Falls project is the cheapest solution for energy for Nova Scotians, yet they have not proved that or, if they have the proof, they are hiding the information from Nova Scotians. Even Emera says, "A final decision about how customers will pay for this new source of electricity, and over what period of time, will actually be determined as part of a general rate application process before the UARB in 2017."</p>
<p>It's interesting that the minister seems to know what the rate will be because he's obviously telling everyone it will be the cheapest option but even the proponent of the project says they don't know. Will the Minister of Energy tell us what the rate for Muskrat Falls energy will be when it is landed in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, certainly the Maritime Link provides many opportunities for Nova Scotians to provide the lowest, fairest rates for electricity in this province. It provides stable prices for 35 years. I would suggest the honourable member might want to read the Dalton report that will give the assumptions and the details on why this is the best deal for ratepayers in this province.</p>

YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dalton's report has been widely discredited by many of the experts in the field who have said that it actually misrepresented a lot of the numbers. He actually made claims about organizations that the organizations themselves said were inaccurate. This is exactly what the NDP did with the recent call for proposals on renewable energy. They set up a process whereby Nova Scotia Power could undercut independent renewable energy suppliers and download the cost to ratepayers. If you look at the South Canoe project, as an example, it moves ahead with uncertain costs when in fact, Dalton, who the minister referenced, said that he told the department that there were risks associated with the way that would be done.</p>
<p>Once again, the NDP chose higher profits for Nova Scotia Power and Emera so they could spend that money outside of Nova Scotia over jobs and economic opportunities in green energy in Nova Scotia. Why did the minister allow the IPP process to be rigged so that Nova Scotia Power could download their capital cost to ratepayers while driving away new renewable energy investment that would have created new rural jobs in Nova Scotia and cheaper energy prices in this province?</p></speech>

PARKER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, certainly you've referenced Mr. Dalton of Power Advisory, a well-respected energy expert in the North American market. In fact, he has done work for this province since about the year 2000. Under various governments, he has done work in New Brunswick and Vermont and various other jurisdictions in eastern North America, and he lives by his reputation. He has to defend his reports before public utilities like the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, and he has to have credible evidence, all the evidence will be cross-referenced by other interveners, and that's how he stays in business. He lives on his reputation. So I take umbrage with the honourable member's information on Mr. Dalton.</p>
<p>In reality we have a plan for energy in this province, certainly the Muskrat Falls is a part of that, but we've taken the HST off of home energy, we've introduced Efficiency Nova Scotia to provide relief for low-income - and really for all Nova Scotians, and we have a plan to have the lowest, fairest electricity rates in this province.</p>
<p>MR.YOUNGER: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dalton was asked about this on February 27<sup>th</sup>, and he said - and I'll table this from The ChronicleHerald, "Dalton said Tuesday he does agree that allowing the utility to charge its capital costs back to ratepayers does give the project 'a different risk profile' that the other projects had." So the minister is wrong. Mr. Dalton actually said that he advised (Interruption)</p>
<p>At the same time, this minister can't tell us the price of this energy. His department was presented with a proposal, which he decided to turn down, from a renewable energy in Cape Breton that offered a guaranteed rate for longer than 35 years, at a cost cheaper than Muskrat Falls, that offered almost all of its economic opportunities in Nova Scotia, instead of most of them in Newfoundland and Labrador, offered a lower carbon footprint than Muskrat Falls, and delivered jobs in Cape Breton. This minister and this Premier said no. I will table the comparative cost analysis by Cape Breton Explorations for their project, which the minister already has, of course.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, why did the minister refuse to allow a renewable energy project that offered to deliver fixed prices, good jobs in Nova Scotia, a new green investment in Nova Scotia, and instead choose to only support a project that costs ratepayers more than that one and helps make Nova Scotia Power even more money?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Let me read a comment from the Hansard Subcommittee of the Whole House on Supply, October 5, 2009 about prepaying universities and fiscal shell games, "Well, I have a view of why they did that. They did that in order to make this year's books look as good as possible, knowing they were on the eve of an election."</p>
<p>The members of the House might be wondering who said that. And I'm sure the minister is wondering who said that. Well, Mr. Speaker, it was the current member for Halifax Fairview, who was the Finance Minister at the time. He made these comments while he was continuing the very same practices that he was disparaging, while he was doing a prepayment to universities. That is what the NDP Government does, how they do business. Saying one thing, and doing another.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after proving that the NDP is more than willing to say one thing and do another, and after having shown that, in past budgets, the NDP has been comfortable with playing financial shell games, the question for the minister is, how can Nova Scotians be certain that this Finance Minister has not pulled yet another prepayment in order to make this year's books look as good as possible, knowing that they are also on the eve of an election?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, universities are a really important feature of Nova Scotia's economy and our learning environment. We're very lucky to have a strong university sector in our province. And if universities are in a situation where they require support from this government on an annual basis, we work very hard to accommodate what those needs are. Whether or not there's a prepayment in any year, it means that the next year, it might also be prepaid, but it doesn't make any difference really. It means that the money is properly accounted for, the payments go to where they're needed and this gives us the strong university sector that we enjoy in the province.</p>

<p>When the Treasury Board decided to ignore that known error and allow an error-prone budget to be presented, they took the integrity of this government into their own hands - either that, Mr. Speaker, or they went right to the top.</p>

He was fully aware of it; he wrote a letter stating that the revenue projections were correct so that is the case.</p>
<p>As to his complaint around the $27 million, I would have known that when he issued the further report that came out a couple of weeks ago, in February, because as the Auditor General pointed out it was not material. In fact it was the normal practice for governments right up until he complained about this particular instance - the same practice that the Progressive Conservative Government would have used for years.</p>
<p>In fact, what he did was make a recommendation with respect to greater transparency, one that had the previous government changed, this would never have been an issue, but they didn't. Mr. Speaker, we're going to adopt the recommendation because it's the appropriate thing to do, and I believe that this will create a level of transparency and integrity on our books that is appropriate.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General was very clear that this is a significant error, it is a $27 million error - $27 million is a lot of money to every Nova Scotian.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Public Accounts Committee the Auditor General said that the issue of materiality is irrelevant to whether you fix an error or not. If the budget is wrong and you know it, you fix it. That is a principle that all Nova Scotians will understand - but the Treasury Board, knowing that the budget was wrong, chose not to fix it. And when they made that decision they took the integrity of this Premier's government into their own hands.</p>
<p>So I will ask the Premier whether any of his staff were present at that Treasury Board decision - I hope he answers, because we are going to do a freedom of information request and find out if they are there or not.

The decision to present a budget with known errors to the people of Nova Scotia apparently was made at Treasury Board, chaired by the Deputy Premier. So my question to the Deputy Premier is, who in the Premier's office got minutes of, was told about, was informed about the decision to go forward with the budget that they knew was wrong before it went to the printers?</p>

You don't say $27 million is not very much money in a province where $27 million to every single person who relies on a truthful government is a lot of money.</p>

LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Earlier this year paramedics sent an alarm bell to the Minister of Health and Wellness, and to all Nova Scotians, about the exodus of advanced care paramedics to other jurisdictions. In response the minister stated, "There's [sic] paramedics that leave every year in the province, and there's [sic] new ones that are hired. It's just like any other profession, really."</p>
<p>In talking to paramedics in my community, they are telling us that it is moving from a trickle to a stream. In fact, they found the minister's statement uncaring in such an important part of the emergency health services here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, could the minister please tell all the members of the House how an ambulance service will be able to retain its world-class stature if we are losing our most advanced and experienced paramedics to other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question any time I have an opportunity to talk about our highly-trained paramedics in this province. I stand by what I said earlier. There are paramedics on a yearly basis who choose to leave the profession here in Nova Scotia. It's very challenging when we see organizations from other jurisdictions, like Alberta, coming to our province and recruiting our highly-trained medics. It's something I've seen through my career as a paramedic, and it's something I've seen through my career as a political MLA.</p>
<p>We're working extremely hard to create an environment here in Nova Scotia that appreciates paramedics, that gives opportunities for them to stay in the province, especially those medics who have been on the ambulance for a number of years. I'm proud of the work that this government has done to improve the working environment that our paramedics work in here in Nova Scotia.</p></speech>

Many of them expressed their frustration around a lack of recognition for the ever-increasing role we have asked them to play in our health care system, respecting what they are asked to do on a daily basis and the challenges associated with policies they are asked to work within.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Health and Wellness, given that the minister has likely heard some of the concerns expressed as well, could he please indicate whether he has spoken to EMC about these issues, and if so, when?</p></speech>

WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as I said, I was very proud to be part of a government that has increased the awareness of paramedics. I want to congratulate the former minister who had the foresight to see, as we move forward with Better Care Sooner, that a key component of that is our paramedics. They are working in a number of environments that they never worked in before. It is because we recognize the importance of their skills, their training, and their dedication.</p>
<p>I know there are some medics who have chosen to leave the province. I don't hold that against any paramedic who makes that decision. It is a very difficult decision to decide to work out West. I know you recognize those decisions that Cape Bretoners have made to choose to go somewhere else to find employment.</p>
<p>I can guarantee - and I want to reassure paramedics that we highly respect the work they do here in Nova Scotia - that I am going to continue to work as Minister of Health and Wellness, and on behalf of the government, to ensure that they have every opportunity to prosper here in the province and to grow their profession, and to show the respect that they deserve.</p></speech>

I can assure you there are more ambulances leaving for trauma situations with no advanced care paramedic onboard.</p>
<p>The strength of our world-class emergency health system lies squarely with our paramedics. We have an emergency health service that Nova Scotians are very proud of, and we should be. However, when you are losing your most experienced paramedics - those who can mentor others, those who can deliver your clot-busting drugs, and those who can work in nursing homes, not to mention those who arrive at the scene of serious accidents for the purpose of immediate treatment and care - you are risking a great deal.</p>
<p>My final question to the minister is, how is the minister going to be able to sustain all of the wonderful things they have mentioned in the Throne Speech pertaining to emergency services when we are losing some of our most experienced advanced care paramedics?</p></speech>

WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure not only paramedics but Nova Scotians of the importance of ensuring that we have the right number of paramedics across this province. We work every day to ensure that if a paramedic leaves, especially an advanced care paramedic, those positions are filled with advanced care paramedics.</p>
<p>By the end of last year, we had over 295 advanced care paramedics in our system; in 2010 we had 294. So we're roughly keeping the same number of advanced care paramedics in the province. We know the importance of trying to encourage those primary care paramedics and intermediate care paramedics, who are in our system, to upgrade their skills, so that they can take full advantage of providing the services, like clot-busting drugs, Mr. Speaker, a first in North America, if not a first worldwide, here in our province.</p>
<p>So we're very proud and I'm very proud of the work we're doing. We're going to continue to work with paramedics to try to address the concerns that some have, and I'm very proud to move forward and work with them, and really show the recognition that paramedics deserve here in our province.</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, since 2008 Strait Area Transit has been providing an essential, accessible transportation for residents of the Strait area, specifically Richmond County, Inverness County, and the Town of Port Hawkesbury. Whether it be for medical appointments, to attend Strait Area Campus of the Community College, or to attend other activities, many residents came to rely on this essential service. Unfortunately, on Monday of this week at 4:00 p.m., the Board of Strait Area Transit announced that it was going to cease operations, effective immediately, due to financial problems.</p>
<p>My question, Mr. Speaker, is to the Premier. Could the Premier advise what actions his government is prepared to take in order to assist in restoring Strait Area Transit?</p></speech>

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I don't know the decision that he's referring to, but if he'd like to send it over to me, I'd be happy to receive it. In fact, when I was last in the Strait, I met with folks from the Strait Area Transit, my understanding is that we assisted them with the issues and the requests that they had. If there is additional information I'd be happy to receive it and to have a look at it.</p>
<p>In fact, this government sees the question of rural transportation as a very important one. It's becoming increasingly important because of the aging population. Seniors have to be able to get to medical appointments. They have to be able to get to grocery stores. They have to be able to pick up prescriptions. We know this is a growing issue, and we're trying to address it in a very proactive fashion. Can we do everything at once? No, obviously not, but we are mapping out a plan for community transportation which will benefit the people in the province. In the initial instance we're working with community-based options.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier may have missed it, but I introduced a resolution earlier talking about Strait Area Transit and its closure and calling upon all members of the House to work together to find a solution. I was very pleased that that received the unanimous support of the House. As the Premier did indicate, I did have the opportunity in the Fall when Strait Area Transit was faced with financial problems to talk to the Deputy Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations and to the minister to seek financial assistance, which we're very pleased that they did.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even with that, the transit has found itself to the point that they were no longer able to operate past Monday of this week, and therefore the operations have ceased. I'm wondering if the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations could advise us as to what actions his department is prepared to take in working with all partners involved to restore this service immediately?</p></speech>

I think the member is aware that the department had given Strait Area Transit about $120,000 last Fall, and another $5,000, I think, two weeks ago. I think before we get too far down that road we want to have a discussion with stakeholders in the area, in particular the municipal units, to see what is possible to try to ensure the long-term sustainability of that service for the people in the Strait area.</p>

I can tell you, my office has been flooded with calls - parents of children who are attending the ROC in Port Hawkesbury, for example, on a daily basis. We're hearing from students who go to the community college, from people who have regularly-scheduled medical appointments, whether it be physio or dialysis, and they really have no option as to how they are going to get to and from now that Strait Area Transit has ceased its operations.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne that the government did acknowledge the importance of community-based transportation, so I guess my question to the minister is, is he prepared to commit to meeting with all stakeholders next week so we can restore the service as soon as possible?</p></speech>

My question to the minister, will you step in to ensure that the South Shore Regional School doesn't cripple the communities of the schools on the chopping block?</p>

            <p>I would like to thank the member opposite for the question. This government is very much invested in our communities and our school communities. His question is, I find, a little perplexing in that we are supporting all of our schools in the province and if they are having any significant difficulties with any of the budget considerations we are most definitely there to support them. I want to say again very clearly we do support our community schools and our communities and the children that go to those schools.</p>

ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there has been 1.5 per cent budget cut to the South Shore Regional School Board this year alone, which equals $1.8 million, and I have a document here to support that. The local economy has lost 5,600 full-time jobs since February 2009, and I have another document here to support that. In The ChronicleHerald there was an article that quoted chairwoman Jennifer Naugler as saying, "I'm very concerned we're dividing those communities we thought we were bringing together."</p>
<p>The communities want to make this work. My question is, will the NDP commit to stop working against Nova Scotians and start working with them to create a prosperous, bright future.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, there are many disturbing cases of animal abuse in our province. Unfortunately, we've seen little in the way of animal protection during this mandate of the NDP Government until recently.

However, it is a shame that the NDP Government has not acted upon animal cruelty matters until now. Cases of abuse and puppy mills and terrible breeding and living conditions for animals across the province have occurred while government sat idly by.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, many of the changes government can make to address these issues can be made in regulations, not in legislation; therefore, the NDP did not have to wait for the legislative session to make changes. My question to the minister is, why has the minister waited to make changes in legislation when the changes could have been made in regulations by the Executive Council at any time?</p></speech>

It's an animal health issue. We rely in particular on the veterinarians who work for us to advise us on legislation or regulations around animal health. We think it's important to listen to the people who are professionally trained in this area.</p>
<p>To this point in my time as minister, which is coming on for four years, there's nothing that they've brought to us that would indicate that there's anything that regulations would have to be tweaked. We are doing a review of that legislation; we have some ideas of changes that we think would be significant and would mirror legislation across the country, but I want to make it clear that we really depend on information from professional veterinarians on how to go about legislation or regulation in terms of proper care for animals.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise to continue my address to the Speech from the Throne. It has been interesting reading over the last few days to have an opportunity to truly assess what has been put before this House as a political document and election platform. I think, to be fair to the government, there were a few things inside this document which provide a little bit of encouragement and comfort for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I know just recently at Question Period we talked about the early childhood development announcement, that that was to be developed inside the Department of Education. Let me tell you, this caucus fully supports and believes that we, as a province, need to develop an early childhood development program to give every child the opportunity to succeed as they go from birth and move through toward their journey through public education.</p>
<p>I hope as part of that there will be early screening and early assessment so that we can identify any challenges that may be there for young Nova Scotians, and that we can provide some supports around not just that young Nova Scotian, but around the family of that young individual, to be able to provide the supports that are required not only to allow that young person to move beyond the challenges they may face, but also provide the family with the supports that are going to be required to help that development as it continues to go.</p>
<p>I will send a note of caution. We have seen what this government has done to the P to 12 education part of that department with drastic cuts - $65 million. During Question Period today we heard just what the increase in electricity by itself has caused for the boards across the province. You can imagine if all of a sudden one of your largest budget items is allowed to continue to go out of control at a rate of 30 per cent, and government is not there to backfill that revenue, it has to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Boards are left in the very difficult position of having to make tough choices - whether they provide librarian service, whether they provide supports in the classrooms to teachers. I can tell you, as I travel the province and get the opportunity to talk to parents, students, and teachers, they are feeling that crunch now - it's evident in classrooms across the province.</p>
<p>Any economist will tell you that the last place, no matter how bad the economic situation is, you should be cutting to balance your books is from your education system. It is the key, quite frankly, for our collective future that we ensure every child gets an opportunity to reach his or her full potential. And yes, I agree with the government, that doesn't start at Primary, it starts at birth. And we need to make sure that as we build the early development program that we are providing supports not only for that young person who may require it, but also for the family. But we can't do that at the expense of public education and continue down the road of cuts and more cuts, Madam Speaker. And particularly when we're allowing the boards to have to suffer through the inflationary costs of all the other parts of their budget that traditionally governments have always been there to support and backfill.</p>
<p>A couple of other aspects of this budget which, in the announcement, were short on detail, and that was the rural transportation strategy. Madam Speaker, it is also a positive thing, on the surface. We need to make sure, though, of the details in and around that rural transportation strategy and what they look like. I know there's amazing work done in around Clare, with Claredon Robichaud who has done tremendous work with Transport de Clare, and other communities.</p>
<p>The member for Richmond talked about, today, that their service is actually being closed because of inability to be able to deliver that - and I want to thank the minister who's responsible for that, the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations who has agreed to sit down with the community and see if there is a way forward to provide a solution. But we need to look at how we enhance that - and for every rural Nova Scotian who requires some transportation assistance, the answer and solution sometimes varies and is different.</p>
<p>So I hope that as the details start showing up of what this strategy will look like, that we get a chance, that the community has a real chance to have input. And one of the great things about this province, and I mentioned Claredon Robichaud, and there are others across the province who have an expertise in delivering transportation to rural Nova Scotians. I would encourage the government to rely on that expertise, bring them in to help them formulate this policy in development as it goes forward.</p>
<p>It's one thing to say it in the budget or in the Speech from the Throne, it's quite another what the details of that look like, And I would be remiss if I didn't add this piece - and that is it is a real issue in rural Nova Scotia in terms of some transportation, well, let's not ignore the fact that it is in many parts of HRM as well - we need to make sure that when we do a transportation strategy we do so looking at the entire province. While the delivery model may be different depending on where you live, the need is still the same and we need to make sure that we work toward that.</p>
<p>One of the announcements I was quite encouraged by was the housing strategy. I know the minister referenced the housing strategy earlier and I must say I'm looking forward to that strategy being released because, Madam Speaker, I think it is the single most important thing that we can do, particularly for low-income Nova Scotians, Nova Scotians who are struggling under the burden of daily living, that we provide them with an affordable housing program.</p>
<p>It has been said many times, I've said it publicly, and I'll put it on record here - only through the grace of God my parents bought a house before my father passed away. Otherwise, I don't know what my mother would have done with all of us, not owning a home. We were fortunate to be able to have a roof over our heads, where she could close the doors and lock them at night and make sure that we were all where we were supposed to be and put our heads down. I can't imagine what her life would have been like without that property, without that house, without her ability to be able to rest those precious few hours that she might have gotten in the evening with 13 kids running around - I don't know what her life would have been like.</p>
<p>There are Nova Scotians, Madam Speaker, who are struggling every day under the same situation, with the lack of either home ownership or the lack of affordable housing in all of its forms.</p>
<p>I know that all members of this House, regardless of which constituency they represent, understand and identify the fact that there are many different needs of housing. We need an affordable way for home ownership, we need affordable rental situations. We also need shelter, Madam Speaker, for those Nova Scotians who just may need an opportunity to find their way in out of the cold, find their way in out of inclement weather, needing a place where they can put their head down at night to find a way to rest.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, these are a few of the things that I felt were in the Speech from the Throne that were actually positive, but I want to ring a note of caution around them because it's really the detail that's going to matter for Nova Scotians. The slogans are one thing, what we say is another, but it's the delivery model that will really matter to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>This government has a history of having slogans, having a big announcement, and then when you dig into the detail of it, it's a very different looking scenario. Just yesterday the Minister of Finance talked about the reduction of the small business tax but they forgot to mention, until quite a bit later in the day, that they also lowered the threshold, to bump some of those businesses out into a much higher tax bracket, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>It is important that as we move down the road of developing some of these strategies and getting them off the paper into practice and reality, it's important that we recognize that we have people inside our communities who are a great resource, who could be part of helping develop those strategies as we go forward.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I don't want to talk all positive about the Speech from the Throne, there are a few things that I think it's important that Nova Scotians know about. I will say that Nova Scotians are watching what this government said a few days ago. They're watching to see, really, the implementation and what it's going to mean. They're watching to see if, quite frankly, they've learned anything over the last four years. They're watching to see if they're going to turn their words into real action and real, meaningful results and so are we.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, as we know, over the last four years, we've added $1.4 billion to the debt of the Province of Nova Scotia. That's 10 per cent of our collective debt since Confederation; 10 per cent of our collective debt has been added to the books of this province under the NDP in four short years. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'm hearing all kinds of stuff in the Chamber; the justification of increasing the debt or breaking promises is something that they're reaching back to the 1990s. I'm going to tell you, Nova Scotians are living in today and they've got real challenges facing them, I would suggest that the government move into today. Nova Scotians are being crushed, quite frankly, by electricity prices. They are being crushed by the fact that this government increased 1,400 user fees, but if that wasn't bad enough, today they tabled in this House increases to 1,400 user fees, but at a much larger rate than they did the previous time.</p>
<p>Think about this, all of the members of this House have people coming into their constituency offices, struggling to meet their daily needs, to pay their power bills. What does this government do? Instead of helping, it finds a way deeper into their pockets. That's not going to help us move our province forward, that's not an economic development strategy.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when we looked at the Industrial Expansion Fund, as this government was, we have been very critical of the way that fund has been used. This government boasted about the fact that it moved from the Industrial Expansion Fund. They renamed it. They actually changed something, too - they should have called it the corporate handout chequebook, because all they seem to do is, the larger the number, they'll accept it. They write the cheque. For six companies, we have written cheques for almost $590 million - almost $600 million - and there are 1,300 fewer Nova Scotians working for those companies today. I want you to think about that: 1,300 fewer Nova Scotians working for those companies after we have given them almost $600 million. Under any other circumstances, no one would even consider that a good investment. If they were in Opposition they would be railing away at that.</p>
<p>Imagine what they would say if either one of us had written a $260 million grant to Irving. Imagine what they would have said to that: a $260 million grant to Irving. He probably wouldn't have been able to make the bottom line if we hadn't given him the money, and what was interesting is how over the last year the government said it was an important aspect of winning the ships contract. Well, Madam Speaker, we just discovered it had nothing to do with it. It was an absolute gift by this government to the Irving family. That's what it was. No one is being employed by that.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Madam Speaker, there is a lot of noise in the back bench of that government. Maybe they are upset that the Premier overlooked them and left somebody who is retiring in Cabinet over them. That's going to be a great story they have to tell their constituents.</p>
<p>When you look at that, though, when you look at the amount of revenue that we have spent out to lay off Nova Scotians, no wonder there are 6,400 fewer Nova Scotians working today. What's really interesting is that there are actually fewer people working today than in the height of the recession. Let me say that again, in case they didn't hear it: there are fewer people working today than in the height of the recession - I want you to think about that for a second - and we have given away hundreds of millions of dollars free, and yet we haven't created the jobs that should have been associated. Not a single job guarantee associated to any of that money we've given out. Not a single protection for Nova Scotia workers. Here's your cheque, cash it, and we hope that maybe you'll create some employment in the Province of Nova Scotia. Madam Speaker, that's not good enough for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>As I travel this province, I meet entrepreneurs from one end of this province to the other, people who are working two-, three-, four-, five-person businesses, who are struggling to keep their businesses afloat, who are working as part of building a community, who really see their employees are more than employees - they see them as members of their community, they see them as soccer coaches of their kids, or Sunday School teachers. They see them as individuals who are trying to build a community with like-minded people, and the last thing they want to do is lay off one of those employees.</p>
<p>But you know the frustration they feel when they see their government take their hard-earned tax dollars and just give it away, and they say, well, wait a second, what about us? What about my grandparents and my parents, who started these businesses in some cases, who have weathered through tough economic times before and have been here through it all? What about us? Why aren't you betting on us? Why aren't you supporting us? Why aren't you supporting us to help grow the economy across this province instead of looking for someone else? They are saying the only thing that we seem to be receiving are fee increases or tax hikes and a fee is just another way for a tax now, that we've seen what is happening under this government.</p>
<p>Do you know what they see? A 2 per cent increase in the HST, 1,400 user fees have gone up twice now in the last four years. On top of that we've added $1.4 billion to the debt of the Province of Nova Scotia. We've cut funding from classrooms that the children are in, power rates are increasing at 30 per cent. No wonder Nova Scotians are frustrated, no wonder Nova Scotians are saying, hey wait a second, what about us when they see their government write these large corporate cheques with no job guarantees and no commitment to the people of this province.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, power has been quite a topic in this province. You may have noticed a commercial that I've been in recently. It is one of interest and I've been really pleased with the response of Nova Scotians around it.</p></speech>

MCNEIL</from><p>Madam Speaker, to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage, I think I was referring to the ad that he did, but I will remind him that the ads that I have done we've actually raised the money and maybe he ought to try doing some fundraising to see what happens. To my point, the challenge for those members is that they can't stand it when someone does the right thing. They can't stand it when someone actually stands up and tells the truth, that's the unfortunate aspect of that group. They had an opportunity to govern and they've squandered it and instead of running on their own record they are now beginning to make up stuff, that Nova Scotians have stopped buying quite frankly. Nova Scotians bought it in June 2009, but do you know what? They said no thanks this time around.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians have been looking at the challenges that are being faced with the actual energy crunch that they're feeling. Never in the history of our province has a government been so tied together with the monopoly in Nova Scotia Power than we have right now. It is so bad today that we have the Minister of Energy traipsing around the province promoting Nova Scotia Power, thinking Nova Scotia Power should be the only game in town, thinking Nova Scotia Power should have the right to run roughshod over the ratepayers in this province. We don't share that view that the member does and it's why (Interruptions)</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Madam Speaker, they can tell their shareholders exactly what this project is going to mean to their stock price, what it will mean to the company's bottom line over the life of this 35-year deal and yet we can't tell Nova Scotia ratepayers what it's going to mean to their power bill. We have to wait until 2017.</p>
<p>Think about this for a second. We're going to sign a 35-year deal, we're going to commit to it, without ever knowing what the real cost is to ratepayers until two years after we're into the deal. It doesn't make any sense, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>We can disagree perhaps on how we should deliver a mixture of energy to the province, but I don't think anyone thinks it's reasonable for the ratepayers of this province to sign an agreement that they won't know what it means to their power bills until two years after they've signed it. It would be like buying a house and two years later they're telling you, by the way, this is how much you paid for it. It doesn't make any sense. Yet, we have a government going around the province promoting it as the best possible deal. How is that the case?</p>
<p>What we have said is, let's look at all of the options. Let's do a true analysis of Muskrat Falls and let's not sign a single thing until we get an opportunity to find out what the cost will mean to the power bills of ordinary Nova Scotians. Let's give the Utility and Review Board the time that they require to analyze this project and also give them the ability and time to look at other options like buying power from New Brunswick, investing in our own Bay of Fundy in an aggressive way to harness our own energy, using some of our natural gas to blend the mix (Interruptions) Madam Speaker, I'm sure if they behave themselves, the Premier will let them stand up at some point to talk.</p>
<p>The fact of it is, this is a 35-year deal. I've heard members of the government talk about Newfoundland and Labrador signing an agreement with Quebec. They signed a long-term deal that they didn't know enough about. That's what happened to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and this government is going down the same road with Nova Scotians but the difference is we're the Newfoundland and Labrador in this deal. We're the ones that are getting the wool pulled over our eyes. We're the ones taking all the risk and it is Newfoundland and Labrador that will be rewarded and it will be the shareholders of Emera who will be rewarded for that.</p>
<p>They talked about the three-legged stool of increasing the revenues and they certainly did that, we've seen that with the HST increase, with 1,400 user fees after saying they weren't going to do that. The one stool they're having a real problem with is economic growth. Under this government, we have the worst performing economy in the country. We have fewer Nova Scotians working today than in the height of the recession. (Interruption) The Minister of Finance is having a problem. Let me reiterate that, fewer Nova Scotians working today (Interruption)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I will be more than happy to have Nova Scotians judge me on how truthful I've been with them, compared to that government. You remember, no tax increases. You remember that - no tax increases, balanced budgets, remember that? Remember that prepayment stuff, how bad that prepayment stuff was? Well, wait until tonight or tomorrow to find that the next big prepayment is going to happen as we head into the next fiscal year. Remember, this is a government that says one thing in Opposition and does something very different. This is a government that tried to hold everyone else to a different standard than themselves. The good news is that Nova Scotians are catching on to the behaviour of this government.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to go back to where I was talking about the worst-performing economy in the country - fewer Nova Scotians working today than in the height of the recession. I want you to think about that recession, how difficult that was on all of our provinces, on the country. Yet this government has done something that no other government could do - they have fewer people working now than when we were at the height of the recession. It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>What did they do? They turned around and increased the HST. What did they do after those 6,400 Nova Scotians lost their jobs and many others are struggling under the escalating power costs associated under this Party? What did they do? They raised 1,400 user fees, not once but twice. It wasn't bad enough that Nova Scotians are struggling because they are afraid to take on Nova Scotia Power; it's not bad enough that they're struggling under the pressures of the utility; it's not bad enough that they're struggling to keep their jobs; it's not bad enough that under this government Nova Scotians are being hit in every corner. What did they do? They turn around and dig into their pockets one more time.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when I think about it, I don't know if I've mentioned earlier that the debt of the province has grown by $1.4 billion under this government. That's 10 per cent of our collective debt, in four years.</p>
<p>No tax increases - you know what happened to that. Do you remember that? What are we getting for that money? More Nova Scotians unemployed, that's what we're getting. What are we getting for that money? We're betting on someone else to come in and solve the challenges of our economy, instead of working and betting on hard-working Nova Scotians. What are we getting for that money? Reduction in public education funding. Kids are being punished, being forced - fewer resources in the classroom. Communities across this province are struggling, and what do they get from this government? Big cheques to big companies, Madam Speaker. Corporate welfare - give it away, let them have it. (Interruption)</p>
<p>It's interesting to hear the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture talking about being against jobs. Nova Scotians would like to see a few more jobs in the Province of Nova Scotia. When they're spending their money they expect to see some results. What we have is $600 million and 1,300 fewer Nova Scotians working for six companies alone, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>The member would remember the big jobs he has been promised down in the aquaculture community in his community. We're still waiting for them to appear. We know what happens: they write the cheque, and they give it away without any commitment or job guarantee to the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. That's the worst performance of any government in the history of this province when it comes to economic development, and it's the worst performance of any government in the history of this province when it comes to corporate welfare.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there's no question - you don't have to ask me, they can cross the province. They can ask Nova Scotians. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>I hear the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville in the background. I suggest to him that if he behaved himself he might get an opportunity to stand on his feet at some other point.</p>
<p>Irving saw an opportunity to come in and they landed and they grabbed what they could, free money, Madam Speaker, let me tell you that, in the guise that they couldn't win the contract without - we know that's not the case, they could have won the contact; we know that. There is no reason why this government couldn't have looked at having that money repaid to the people of the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I do want to also talk about the issue that was brought up by the member for Eastern Shore around the forest industry. Obviously, as you know, in southwestern Nova Scotia it's becoming a big issue, a big concern, around what the future is going to be for those lands that we have paid a substantial price for and how we are going to use those. There is the issue around this community forest concept and it is worrisome to say the least on some members of the community of what potentially may happen. I think it's important that as we do this - and I would encourage all members of the government to actually pay attention to the member for Eastern Shore who has a depth of knowledge, when it comes to the forest sector, that I think surpasses probably our collective knowledge in this House. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the issue for many private-sector woodlot owners is what is this strategy going to look like, what is it going to mean to the market - is it going to depress prices? In southwestern Nova Scotia, like indeed all Nova Scotia, there are mixed-use farms, there are people who work outside of their land and use the forest as a way to provide some additional income to their family. They cut a few little logs; they sell them. They are concerned about this massive amount of public lands and what potentially could become a place for a lot of mills to get low stumpage, quite frankly &#x2026;</p></speech>

        <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>It's going to seem longer than that, Mr. Speaker, but thank you very much.</p>
<p>I thought I would begin this morning by introducing to you, sir, and to the House, the new members of the Progressive Conservative caucus. The returning members are familiar to Nova Scotians and to the members present so I hope they don't mind if I just take a moment and introduce the new recruits.</p>
<p>To my immediate right is the new MLA for Pictou Centre - the comeback kid, as we like to call him on this side of the House - who has a lifetime of experience as a teacher and educator, as a hockey coach and manager, as a softball player. When I was out on the campaign trail with him this past Fall, he liked to tell the stories of the big home run that he hit that actually not only cleared the fence but cleared the parking lot and beaned a car on the way by. I don't know how many votes that story got him, and I'm sure it's 100 per cent true, but he still tells that story to this day.</p>
<p>Behind me I'd like to introduce the member for Pictou West who is new to this House but from a part of the province that is of particular importance to my family as the origin of the Baillie family is in Pictou West. She is a hard worker, a great community volunteer, a businesswoman, a mother of two. She is the type of person, when you get to know her, who proves that old saying that if you want something done, find the busiest person in town and that person is the new MLA for Pictou West. I just want to welcome her to our caucus and to the House of Assembly.</p>
<p>You will see in a moment why I think so highly of Pictou County these days because next to her is the new MLA for Pictou East, that's a theme this morning. I always said they were very wise voters in Pictou County, maybe they're trendsetters, we'll see at a future date. The MLA for Pictou East has a background as a chartered accountant. As I said yesterday, we could use a few more - we've managed to double the number of chartered accountants in the Legislature. As a business person and a father raising kids and a minor hockey coach, a great member of his community and I know he'll do a great job for us - not just for us on this side of the House, but for all of the House of Assembly and for all Nova Scotians. I want to welcome him as well.</p>
<p>Behind him to keep us all on the straight and narrow is the new MLA for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, or as one of his predecessors used to call it, the "beautiful Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley". He is a United Church minister with several decades - I won't say how many - of service to his faith and to the people of his congregation. He is an easy campaigner who has a great manner with people and has already made a positive contribution to the tone of the debates that we have in our own caucus. I've never seen my fellow MLAs watch their words so carefully as they have since he has joined our team. I do want to welcome the new member to the House of Assembly as well and I hope everyone does the same.</p>
<p>The new member for Kings North, our Agriculture Critic, a farmer in his own right and a business person who has a very successful family farm in the Kings County area. I'm already a user of some of his produce. Members may be familiar, particularly members from the Valley, of the savoury teas that he produces from the ground up, literally. I can tell all members, they are a great source of comfort and relaxation at the end of a long day, a nice cup of hot tea, which of course is a non-alcoholic beverage, which is an extra benefit when one is looking to relax after a long day here in the House of Assembly. I highly recommend his products. He's also, of course, a representative at the Federation of Agriculture meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, those are the five new members of the Progressive Conservative caucus, and I want to thank all members for joining me in welcoming them to the Legislature. (Applause) I know there are new members on the other side of the House, as well, more than I would have personally chosen, but in any event they are here and I just want to welcome them. I will leave it to a member on the government side to those introductions, but I will, of course, extend our welcome sincerely to them.</p>
<p>I also just want to take a moment - and I hope the House doesn't mind - to acknowledge there are some members who are not returning to the Legislature after the most recent election: many due to retirement, some voluntary, and some not so voluntary. I'm only going to take a moment and speak of one; I will leave it to others to cover the rest if they wish.</p>
<p>I just want to stand as Leader of my Party and thank the former member for Victoria-The Lakes, Mr. Keith Bain, for his years of service to his constituency, to our Party, and to his province. He was our caucus chair. I know the current member for Victoria-The Lakes will agree with me that he is a gentleman. He always had the best interests of the people at heart and we certainly miss him, and I know that we will all miss his wisdom, his guidance, and his calm demeanor in this House.</p>
<p>If everyone could join me for a moment - and I say that with absolutely no disrespect to the newly-elected member for Victoria-The Lakes, whom I'm looking forward to hearing from as the proceedings go on in the days ahead. It is one of those realities of politics that people win and people are defeated in elections, but with her indulgence, I just want to take a moment to recognize the work Mr. Bain did.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, together with our new members, our returning members here on the Opposition side, we of course recognize that there is a new government, but I also want to say that we have pledged ourselves to be a new kind of Opposition. By the way Nova Scotians were crying out for a new kind of Opposition, after the Opposition they saw - no, I'm just kidding. I heard the Government House Leader saying "Hear! Hear!" so I just wanted to tell him how much I respect his acknowledgement that we needed a new kind of Opposition as well.</p>
<p>In any event, we are committed, as we spoke of yesterday, to setting a tone of adult-like and respectful debate in this House of Assembly. We certainly will look to the government to bring forward good legislation that will actually make the lives of Nova Scotians better and we're quite prepared to work with the government to support it, even to amend it and make it better when necessary or when possible, to see that good things happen for all Nova Scotians. That is step one of being a new kind of Opposition as well.</p>
<p>I also mentioned yesterday that where the government strays, we are certainly going to hold them to account. That's an important part of our job and Nova Scotians have hired us to do that job, and we intend to do that job when necessary. Hopefully it won't be necessary that often but that, of course, is also up to the government. But we are here to do our job.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we are committed that when we are called upon to critique the government, to criticize government actions that we feel are wrong for Nova Scotia, to do our job in opposing what the government is doing if they go off in the wrong direction. Even then, we want to set a very high standard in Opposition, as well, and that is we will match our criticisms when they come with the willingness to put forward alternative, good ideas of our own. As Nova Scotians have often said in the past, Oppositions always oppose, but they've never said what they would do. We are quite prepared, when we are called upon to oppose, to also openly, frankly, bravely, and honestly tell Nova Scotians what we would do differently. That elevates the debate in this Chamber and it elevates the practice of politics in our province. We believe in it and we are going to do it.</p>
<p>Today is a good example, Mr. Speaker. Today is a good example because the government has brought forward its first bill on energy - the bill that will allow for the sale of renewable electricity directly to retail consumers. Now, we have many questions about that bill and I won't go through them all today because I know we will have a chance to do that in this Chamber shortly. It was part of their election campaign, it was part of their TV ads, and I have no doubt that they did attract votes in part because of it.</p>
<p>From our own point of view it has the same flaws as the NDP electricity plan used to have, which is that they cannot say how much the electricity will cost when it gets to our homes any more than the previous government did and so that is a criticism, Mr. Speaker. That is a statement in opposition to what the government is doing. We may well, in the days ahead as we examine the bill, conclude that it is nothing but smoke and mirrors; it's nothing but a shell game designed to win an election but not actually make electricity prices better.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if we do come to that conclusion, we will of course put forward for Nova Scotians, side by side with that criticism, our own plan that we believe will make the electricity market better, will give Nova Scotians a break on their electricity bills, and then Nova Scotians can see two alternative plans for our electricity bills.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I say this today because as members saw when the government tabled its bill for debate, introduced it, that the PC caucus, the Official Opposition, also put forward its own electricity bills that truly do get at the heart of what has gone wrong with our electricity prices in this province, including the guaranteed profit of the power company, something the Liberals seemed to agree with us in Opposition was not fair, and yet remain silent on now that they are in government. Well, we are not silent on that. We said the same thing before the election, that guarantee has to go, and we're saying the same thing today now that the election is over.</p>
<p>So that is the standard we set for ourselves in Opposition and we're showing it today, Mr. Speaker. I only raise the electricity at this point because it's an example of doing what we say we are going to do, and I hope the government sets the same example for itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, at this moment I want to veer off for just a brief time and return to the constituency of Cumberland South, the people there, the issues there, and why the things that we do in this House matter so much to my constituents and indeed to all Nova Scotians because Cumberland South is a beautiful part of our province. It is a gateway, really, to Nova Scotia for those who come by land from New Brunswick. It is a place with a great industrial history, a great natural resource history. It is a place where people have earned a living for generation after generation in the hardest of ways.</p>
<p>In the Town of Springhill, for example, Mr. Speaker, I'm sure all members are familiar with the mining history there, 100 years of mining, of too many disasters along the way, too many lives lost as the people of the Town of Springhill eked out a living from the coal seams underneath. To this day in Springhill we celebrate Davis Day, which I know all Cape Bretoners also take great interest in, where the coal mining tradition is so strong there, and we watch very carefully the rules around workplace safety. In fact, the largest industrial disaster in Nova Scotia to this day was the Springhill Bump of 1958. I see the government is bringing forward a plan to hire more workplace safety officers and prosecutors, and that is actually an interesting plan that has been noticed and will be followed by the people of Springhill.</p>
<p>The mines have left a legacy, Mr. Speaker, for future potential in the geothermal energy that is trapped underneath; in fact, there are companies in Springhill today that are tapping that great source of energy, showing signs of hope for future industrial growth and jobs in the Town of Springhill.</p>
<p>Ropak Packaging, for example, may not be a household name to many Nova Scotians unless the next time they reach into their freezer for some ice cream, or into their fridge for some yogurt, they take the container and turn it over and read the label at the bottom - it is almost guaranteed, Mr. Speaker, the name of Ropak of Springhill is on the bottom of that container because that's where those ice cream containers and yogurt containers, and other plastic containers like them, come from.</p>
<p>The reason I raise it today, Mr. Speaker, is because that plant is heated by geothermal heat extracted from the old mines of Springhill - a great source of potential renewable energy in the future. It's not the only example in Springhill, but it is an example of why we have to get the energy market right for the future.</p>
<p>Not far from Springhill is the Town of Parrsboro, a great town and a great cultural town, home of the Ships Company Theatre, also with its own industrial base, also with hope for a future in renewable energy. In fact, I believe that the mother of the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board is a resident of the Town of Parrsboro, at least she tells me that every time that I see her - how she votes, I guess we'll have to leave that for another day.</p>
<p>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Parrsboro is the closest point of contact to the tidal energy potential of the Bay of Fundy. It is home to the tidal research centre. It is a town that is off the beaten track because of where the new highways have been laid; it's a town with a great past, but now with signs of hope for a better future as tidal energy is developed and comes on line and becomes an affordable source of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we continue along the Fundy shore, down through such great traditional shipbuilding towns a Port Greville, Diligent River, and into the Advocate area, an area with a great lobster fishery, an area that is below sea level, but thanks to the combined efforts of the federal government and the provincial government working together, a seawall has been reconstructed to protect the residents of the Advocate area. It's an example of governments not pointing the finger at each other, but working together to get something important done.</p>
<p>I will just say very quickly that no one worked harder than the Member of Parliament for our area, Mr. Scott Armstrong, to get that seawall built. I was pleased, as provincial MLA, to help on the provincial side, and I will give credit to the previous NDP Government for also working together with the Government of Canada to get that seawall done. That's an important addition to that area of Cumberland County.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, going around the Chignecto Cape, if you will, through the largest provincial park in Nova Scotia, we come to the Towns of Joggins and River Hebert, a great source of history, particularly geological history - also an interesting place to examine the commitments of governments, past and present, to our kids and to education because those who went through the election in our part of Nova Scotia will surely know by now that there is a school in River Hebert that is in desperate need of an upgrade. It literally is half in rubble and is waiting, hopefully any day now, for an announcement that the tenders to fix that school are going out. When that day comes, I'll be the first one to thank everyone involved for making that happen.</p>
<p>Continuing along through Nappan and Maccan and back on the highway, in my little tour of Cumberland South we come to the Town of Oxford, the wild blueberry capital of the world, with one of the largest, if not the largest, blueberry processing plant around, employing 400 people directly and thousands more through the harvesting of blueberries and the processing of them at that plant.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, one of the interesting things about Oxford Frozen Foods is, you know how they dealt with the high cost of electricity, which is a big input cost for them? They went and built a gas pipeline from the main natural gas pipeline that runs through our province to their plant to get off of electricity for heating purposes and onto natural gas which is a cheap, clean, and well used source of power in many parts of the world, including the northeastern Atlantic, in order to make their plant more competitive. I say that because Nova Scotians want us to use more of their own natural gas here at home and Oxford Frozen Foods is a great example of making that happen.</p>
<p>Many members in this House may have read in the papers just recently that they do more than blueberries at Oxford Frozen Foods. They actually in the offseason they do carrots, and in the offseason they do onion rings, which of course require onions. I as MLA - I'm sure along with many - were very alarmed when they had to lay off about 160 people because their source of onions went missing. Mr. Speaker, I'm delighted to report that the onions have been found, the trains are rolling and the workers have been called back and those onion rings are going to be made. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in my constituency of Cumberland South, I just want to be very clear there are some issues that are very, very important that this government deal with, and number one beyond any doubt is jobs. We've got great natural resource potential in Cumberland South, we've got hope for the future, but like too many other parts of rural Nova Scotia young people have given up and moved away. Not enough effort is being put into fully developing any sustainable way, our forestry industry, for example, which is a big part of Cumberland South; including the best maple products in the world, like maple syrup. Or our fisheries, like the fishery in Advocate that I mentioned. Or our rural manufacturing base, which relies on clean but affordable energy to compete around the world. Jobs are number one in Cumberland South.</p>
<p>The people of Cumberland South know as well as anybody that long-term jobs start with a world-class public education here at home in their own communities and that's why that school in River Hebert is so important, that it get done. For a big area of our province, that school is not only a necessary piece of education infrastructure, it's an important piece of economic infrastructure if we're going to send a signal to thousands of children in Cumberland County that this government takes education very seriously and wants every child in Nova Scotia to know whether you live in River Hebert or downtown Halifax you are going to get the best education that money can buy. That's why education is so important in Cumberland South.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Speaker, in places like Oxford, Parrsboro, and Springhill, long-term care for our seniors is also very important and it doesn't really need more studies, more thought, more consultation, or promises of something that will happen someday far into the future. We need a plan for long-term care for our seniors today, now. Four years ago there was a plan when a new government was elected, and nothing happened between then and today. Now we have a new government again that has a chance to do right by our seniors, whether it's homecare for those that are able to stay at home, which of course we would all want, or advanced level care for those seniors who have been accessed as needing extra help, extra care, and extra attention. This is one of the gripping issues of our time including in Cumberland County.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the Throne Speech yesterday the government named appropriately a number of Nova Scotians we lost, who passed away in the past year. I would just like to add, as the MLA for Cumberland South, one other name - there could be more - but Clara Bacon. A great, great resident of Cumberland County, and due to the recent redistribution of the boundaries a resident of Cumberland South, passed away since we last met in this Chamber. Some will know Mrs. Clara Bacon as the wife of former Premier Roger Bacon, indeed she was for over 60 years, which on its own is pretty impressive when you think about it. Certainly he would be the first to say that he could not have done the work he did in agriculture, in politics, including as our Premier, without Clara by his side.</p>
<p>What I want to share for a moment with the members of this House is that Clara Bacon was quite a force to be reckoned with in her own right. They ran quite a farm and Premier Bacon was not around a lot of the time. Clara was the boss. I have met many Cumberland County residents - and I'm sure the member for Cumberland North will attest to this - who have stories about being taken in by Clara at the Bacon farm. Young people who were maybe straying in the wrong direction, young people who needed a little work or a little discipline or a little guidance to get off on the right track. Clara Bacon never turned anyone away when she saw an opportunity to bring them in and put them to work or feed them at the Bacon family table when they were hungry. That is a great legacy and one that I just wanted to take a moment and recognize in this House.</p>
<p>I spoke a moment ago about the new kind of Opposition that we intend to show to the people of Nova Scotia. Let me return just for a moment to the kind of government I believe they expect. Nova Scotians have made a pretty big investment in the new government, and like anyone who makes an investment they expect a return on their investment. They have high hopes, they really do, for what a new government can do, and they have pretty high expectations as well. The reason they do is that a lot of promises were made by the governing Party en route to being in government.</p>
<p>They told Nova Scotians, for example, that they would have the same effect on Nova Scotians' power bills as they saw on their phone bills. I don't know how that's going to work out, nor does anyone else that's ever looked at it, including a lot of experts, but Nova Scotians voted for the government in part because they believed their power bills were going to be lower. That's an expectation that's been set and I hope they meet it, not just for my power bill but for everybody's power bill. I hope they meet it. We will see shortly.</p>
<p>When they were running, the governing Party said they had all the answers to the great problems of our province. High unemployment would be brought down, and high taxes would be reviewed. Well, Nova Scotians hear "review" as "make better", and "better" means "more affordable and lower". Also that the flow of our young workers out West would be stopped. These are expectations that the governing Party set. I hope they meet all of them.</p>
<p>Beyond taxes and power rates and matters economic, Nova Scotians heard great promises from the new government about how our schools would get better, how our class sizes would be smaller, how every child would have the educational assistance they need, and all those things are worthy and important goals and I hope they meet them. Or, how our hospitals would get better, how reducing the administration would show up in better service and shorter wait times. I hope all those things come true, because that's what Nova Scotians were told. They voted this government in, and that is now what they expect to happen.</p>
<p>There is the return on investment that Nova Scotians are now expecting to see. Did the cost of living actually get better under this new government? Did my power bill go down? Did the HST go down? Did my taxes get more affordable? Did the user fees, the 1,300 of them that they used to complain about in Official Opposition, actually change? That will be one test of whether Nova Scotians got a fair return on their investment or not. How many people live in our province today? How many people are in the workforce today? How many young people have jobs today compared to four years from now? That will be a test of whether Nova Scotians are getting a fair return on their investment.</p>
<p>Side by side with that, along with all those ones that we can actually measure - on costs, on taxes, on power rates, on schools, wait lists, and class sizes - there's another important measure of return on investment when Nova Scotians elect a new government. That is, did they keep the faith with voters? There may not be a number that you can assign to it, but it is very important. Did they keep the promises that they made? They don't need to look too far to the size of the NDP caucus to know what happens when you tell Nova Scotians one thing before an election and do the opposite after the election. Did they do what they said they would do?</p>
<p>Already Nova Scotians are starting to wonder, including the editorial writers of The ChronicleHerald and even the Cape Breton Post, who took note of an Opposition Liberal Party who criticized the NDP, who ran TV ads criticizing the NDP for giving so much money away out of a Cabinet slush fund to large companies, saying it was wrong, saying they would not do that, saying that Nova Scotians deserved change in the way our hard-earned tax dollars were just thrown away to large companies.</p>
<p>Then the Auditor General of Nova Scotia came in and said, you know, there are no controls over this Cabinet slush fund where hundreds of millions of dollars are given away. The Liberal Government had a chance to do what they said they would do on this important issue already - 52 days in and they didn't. Now they say, well, maybe we'll keep that money in our own hands anyway, never mind what we said before the election. Part of that return on the investment that Nova Scotians made in this government is that they will do what they said they would do before the election even after the election, and that one example is an early return that is going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians expect a lot of this government, as they should. They were told a lot on the campaign trail. They're watching. They've already waited 52 days to see some example of change - they voted for change, and they haven't seen the change yet. We're giving them a chance over here, we are really trying, because we want to see change. I absolutely agree, the election was about changing the way the province is run, but if saying you're going to get rid of the Jobs Fund before the election and then not doing it after the election is where we're headed, that's not the kind of change that Nova Scotians want. That's the same old way.</p>
<p>Hopefully it isn't the start of a trend, but we'll save our examination of that flip-flop and any others for a future day. Instead, for today I just want to say before I take my place that we're all here now, the election is over, and we accept absolutely the results. We'll get on with our jobs, the swearing-in and the ceremonies and the congratulations parties - of which there have been a lot - the time for that has now passed. We are 52 days into this government; it is time for them to act. It is time for them to actually use the levers of power that have been entrusted to them and actually make something different, make something better, make something happen that was not happening before. That will be the test, Mr. Speaker, of whether Nova Scotians truly got more than just a change of colour of the Party in power. After all, orange to red it not that much of a change in the spectrum; I sure hope that we get more change than that.</p>
<p>Let me just conclude again by welcoming the government into office as I've tried to give them a very hearty welcome here this morning and, if I haven't made it clear already, put them on notice that we are here to make sure they do the job they were hired to do and let the debate begin. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

That is a real concern and I would encourage the member for Halifax Citadel-Sable Island to stop talking and listen to the member for Eastern Shore, because I'm telling you it is a real concern.</p>

          <from>MR. PREYRA</from>
          <p>We bought that land back after you had sold it off; we bought it back.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is a real concern. It's one more indication of what potentially will erode rural Nova Scotia. We need to be very mindful of the unintended consequences of the decision. Government has bought the land, it's there. Now what is going to happen with it? And let's not engage the citizens in a charade, let's be open and listen to what ideas they may have. It is a real concern to private woodlot owners in southwestern Nova Scotia and, I would dare say, across the province, that this land does not become low stumpage which depresses the private-sector market, because I'll tell you there are many families, there are many mixed-use farms, quite frankly, that rely on that income, require that income to feed their families and keep them afloat.</p>
<p>So it is critical that whatever decision is made around that that it is done in the best interests of all Nova Scotians and that it is done with the idea that that resource needs to be there for the long haul, and we need to make sure that that resource is not harvested in a way that it will depress private-sector prices and force private-sector landowners to look for work elsewhere because they can't sell their product here in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it is important as we move forward that this government takes its time around those community forests and, for God's sake, don't do any more damage to the rural economy than you've already done. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I know the members of the government are quite exercised by the fact that they're getting an opportunity to hear what I've been hearing from Nova Scotians, the frustration they've been feeling from this government, the frustration, the disappointment, the anger they felt over this government saying one thing when they've been heading into an election campaign and doing the exact opposite.</p>
<p>I can tell you, as you travel the province, Nova Scotians are quick to point out that this is not what they thought they were getting in 2009, this is not the government they thought they would get. Really, what I think highlighted it and underlined it was the reaction of the government yesterday around questioning around $27 million - saying it's no big deal, it's only $27 million, what's the big deal, $211 million, $238 million deficit - it's no big deal, they shrug their shoulders.</p>
<p>Well, it's actually a big deal to Nova Scotians. They're struggling and the government shrugs its shoulders. What's even more galling is the fact that we now know that the Minister of Finance stood in his place in this House and delivered a budget that he knew was wrong, he knew the numbers weren't accurate. We now know the Premier knew so we now know that they stood in their place and we now know that they knew that the budget they were tabling was wrong.</p>
<p>I don't think it's too much to ask, I don't think Nova Scotians think it's too much to ask, that you deliver on the facts that you have. The government knew that there was a $27 million error in their budget but the problem with revealing that $27 million error was it meant they would have had to actually then say they weren't on track. It really wasn't about being up front with Nova Scotians, it really wasn't about laying out the proposal, the ideas, the facts that they had; it was about trying to meet their storyline. It was more important that they met their storyline than it was about being up front with Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>As the days unfold between now and next Thursday, we're going to see more of it. We're going to find out how much they're going to be able to offload to last year, to balloon the deficit to whatever it may be. They didn't care if there was a difference between $211 million and $238 million so I'm sure they'll pick another number that's a bit higher than that and offload some expenses and be able then to try to convince Nova Scotians that they've balanced the books.</p>
<p>I don't believe Nova Scotians will be fooled. They didn't accept it when the previous Tory Government tried it and I don't believe they'll accept it from an NDP Government. What they want from their government, they want the government to be open and frank and honest with them. Nova Scotians are prepared to do their part, they've done it for generations, they're prepared to do what's required to move this province forward but they can't do it when the government is not being forthright with them. They can't do it when the Minister of Finance would stand in this House and deliver a document that's inaccurate - and he knew it was inaccurate - they can't do it when their government is betting on someone else from outside of our province instead of investing in Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we look forward to next Thursday when this budget is going to be introduced, but you know what's going to be interesting is the stories that come out before then, actually before Monday. As we know, the offloading of a number of expenses, we'll see how much universities are going to receive early. Or maybe it's another large chunk of cash they want to offload. Just like they told us they weren't going to raise the user fees, but not only did they do it once, they did it twice. They enjoyed it so much last time they increased them more this time.</p>
<p>We look forward to the opportunity (Interruptions) I'm like most Nova Scotians, I'm living in today, and maybe if the government started living in today they might actually be doing a better job than they are now. Maybe rural communities would have doctors. Maybe emergency rooms wouldn't have been closed for 17,000 hours under the watch of this government. Maybe six emergency rooms wouldn't have been closed. I'm just saying, that's the reality of today. That's the reality Nova Scotians have to deal with with this government. If they want to live in the past, I encourage the Nova Scotians who are suffering today - and they might want to do something to accept the responsibility they were given in 2009 and do their job.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, with those few remarks I will take my place. (Applause)</p></speech>

        <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm glad you had everyone take a deep breath because I know how much they are going to want to listen carefully to what I have to say.</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to rise on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, something that is becoming an annual event here in this House. Speeches from the Throne traditionally have been less frequent, but with the NDP it's every year, and we can see why. Each year they have felt the need to press the reset button on their record and hope Nova Scotians will forget everything that came before and start all over again - kind of like the <i>Dallas</i> dream sequence, which some members will remember, where one of the lead characters on <i>Dallas</i> was killed off one year, but that didn't go over very well with the viewers, so they made up a scene where that had all been a dream so they could start all over again.</p>
<p>That is exactly what is happening here today. It's just like that bad dream in that <i>Dallas</i> season so many years ago. The NDP is hoping that with yet another annual Speech from the Throne we will all think the previous year had just been a bad dream and they'll get a whole new season. Madam Speaker, we'll see how often that works.</p>
<p>We do have a Throne Speech. We have a whole new Throne Speech again, and there are a few things that I do want to talk about, just right off the top, that I agree with. For example, I was very pleased to see in the Throne Speech that the government intends to set aside a day in Nova Scotia to remember those who have been lost at sea - a very important part of the economic development of our province, the risks that people have taken in the past and present and will again in the future to make a living for their families, to build up their communities - primarily rural communities, fishing communities. How appropriate now, when we have such a recent reminder of the dangers that many of our fellow Nova Scotians face every year as they go to sea and fish to make a living.</p>
<p>The community of Woods Harbour had a very tragic reminder, as the Throne Speech notes, when we lost Katlin Nickerson, Billy Jack Hatfield, Joel Hopkins, Steven Cole Nickerson, and Tyson Townsend. Having gone through that together just in the last month, one of the things that struck me was that it was not just a loss for the community of Woods Harbour; all Nova Scotians felt that loss.</p>
<p>In fact, there were memorial services, benefits, and fundraisers across the province in places like Pictou, and here in the capital, in Halifax, I attended one myself, as I'm sure many members did, as we all shared in the grief of that community and those families, and we all understood because we're fellow Nova Scotians, the risks that are run to earn a living in our fishing communities.</p>
<p>In my own riding of Cumberland South we have a number of fishing communities - Advocate Harbour along the Parrsboro Shore. I haven't done a count but I'll bet you many, many members of this House represent constituencies where there are fishing communities, so we share in that loss together. For that reason I believe it's appropriate that we set aside a day every year where we remember the hundreds of Nova Scotians through the generations, who go to sea to earn a living. It's an important part of our history and our present and our future.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, while we're on the topic of the past year and the human loss that we suffer together as a province, I do just want to take a moment and recognize a few of the Nova Scotians we all lost who are mentioned in the Throne Speech who I knew personally, starting with our 29<sup>th</sup> Lieutenant Governor, Mr. John James Kinley, who I had the pleasure of meeting and whose family I know, a family that has done so much not only for their home community in Lunenburg but through public service and through charitable works for our whole province.</p>
<p>Of course we pause at times like this and remember the loss of the Kinley family this year and a loss that we all share because Nova Scotians lost a great contributor to the public life of our province.</p>
<p>I'd also like to just pause for a moment, Madam Speaker, and recognize the loss of Raylene Rankin of the Rankin family. I grew up with the Rankin family. I know many members here are fans of the music of the Rankin family. I know that we all consider it a little bit a part of ourselves when we hear the Rankin family on the radio or we hear their music played around our province and, in fact, around the world. Their success shows that we do have a unique, Nova Scotian cultural identity, very impressively captured in Mabou and area in Inverness but also in other places, that has value, that has meaning, that is an industry unto itself, a cultural industry that not only people here in Nova Scotia value and want to hear and see but people around the world are willing to pay to buy a ticket, buy a CD, hear them in concert.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Rankins set a whole new standard of spreading the Nova Scotia culture, particularly musical tradition, around the world. Raylene, who people who know her know was a wonderful person as well as a gifted musician, know the loss that we all feel, not just the Rankin family, not just the people of Mabou or Inverness but all Nova Scotians share in that loss. That's one of the things that makes us a great province, no matter where you were born, no matter where you come from in the world, no matter what your background is, no matter what station in life you started off in or aspire to be in, that when we lose Nova Scotians like those fishermen and like Raylene, that we all feel that loss.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Ruth Goldbloom falls into that category, another Nova Scotian who I had the great privilege of knowing and calling a friend for over 20 years. Her signature accomplishment, of course, is Pier 21, now known as Canada's National Museum of Immigration. We all know how tirelessly Ruth Goldbloom worked to make that happen. We all know it wouldn't be there today without the work of Ruth Goldbloom and the team that she put together. What we may not ever know in total, what we may not ever be able to add up in total was all of the other things that Ruth Goldbloom did for our province. All of the charities, all of the causes, all of the stitching of our social fabric that she did behind the scenes. You can count it in the hundreds and hundreds of different gifts of time and fundraising to make this province a better place.</p>
<p>I say that, Madam Speaker, because certainly her roots were in Cape Breton, and the people of Cape Breton feel that loss. Her home when she returned to our province from Montreal with her husband Dick, was Halifax, and all of Halifax feels that loss. But we know from having lived through it just this past year that all Nova Scotians, together, feel the loss of someone who made such a great contribution to our province as Ruth Goldbloom - another example of how when one family loses a member of their family, we all feel it.</p>
<p>Daurene Lewis, another example. I had the great privilege of working with Daurene on a number of community initiatives, including serving together on the board of Neptune Theatre. Daurene's contribution to Annapolis, to her area of the province, is well known. It was historic, and I'm proud that Nova Scotia boasts the town with the first African Nova Scotian female mayor. But her contributions spread to all Nova Scotia, and her loss - again, a loss for her family, a loss for her hometown - is also a loss for all of us.</p>
<p>Paul Comeau from Clare, who I only got to know in the last two years - so dedicated to the Acadian Community, so entrenched in the Acadian history, so proud to be an Acadian Nova Scotian - and by the way, a very, very good cook, as anyone who has been to his restaurant will remember. On the lighter side, the loss that we feel, that that home that he turned into a restaurant, that still remained a home, closed with his passing. When it closed not only did his family suffer a loss, not only did his community - Clare and the Acadian community - suffer a loss but all Nova Scotia suffered a loss, and I feel very privileged to have gotten to know him, if just in the last years of his life.</p>
<p>Pat Connolly, from our sporting heritage, fits into that category. From now on generations of Nova Scotians are going to go to the Halifax Metro Centre to watch a hockey game, or a basketball game, or any event and they are going to see the Pat Connolly sportscaster's box. I hope for years and years to come they'll know why it's called that, because for Nova Scotians who grew up here, who follow sports here, for the last number of generations in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and up to this year, they knew the contribution that Pat Connolly made to telling the sporting story of Nova Scotia in its many forms. We all share in that loss together.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, in the spirit of coming together as a Nova Scotia family, I am very pleased that the government included those individuals and many others, equally deserving, who I would like to talk about, but didn't get to know personally, who we all lost as a Nova Scotia family in the last year. To see the government recognize them in this way, recognize the loss of our fishing communities like Woods Harbour and set aside a day of remembrance, I think, is an appropriate thing. I know when that bill comes forward we'll be right there to help the government pass it, so Nova Scotians can have a way of remembering for all time the people who have come before.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, I do want to go on for a moment and reflect on what the Throne Speech means to my own constituency of Cumberland South. As some members - hopefully all members - in the House know, but certainly as my fellow seatmate from Cumberland County, the member for Cumberland North, knows, and I know the member for Timberlea-Prospect has a history in Cumberland County, and there are others who know it's a beautiful part of our province. It's a constituency, by the way, that has been touched by its own tragedies throughout its history, as all Nova Scotians know. I mention the fishing communities, but throughout time it has also been a heavy industrial area and certainly is most well-known for its mining history.</p>
<p>The people of Springhill in particular remember well the many mining disasters throughout their town's history. I know that we pause and remember the more recent ones - the fire of 1956, the bump of 1958 - here in this House, and appropriately so. They remain among the largest workplace accidents in the history of our province.</p>
<p>I am proud to have met the remaining surviving miners from those disasters. Herb Pepperdine, for example, I've mentioned in this House before, was trapped for nine and a half days during the bump of 1958 and tells the story to this day of how he and his fellow miners who were survivors managed through nine and a half days underground. Dr. Arnold Burden, who is very active to this day, was one of the first to go underground with the draegermen as a doctor to look for survivors and to treat them and bring them to the surface. This is a history that the people of Springhill share, but it's a history that all Nova Scotians share as we pause from time to time and reflect on this great Nova Scotia family.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when I compare the lofty promises made in the Throne Speech to the needs and the reality of Cumberland County, I have to tell you I am very disappointed that the government has nothing worthwhile to say to the people of Cumberland County that will make a difference in their lives.</p>
<p>We have a government that insists that it wants to do something good for our kids in schools and education. I can run down the list of schools in Cumberland County that are either in disrepair or in threat of closure, or have had expansion plans cancelled because of the squeeze that the NDP have put on our school board. Just yesterday in this House I raised the sad story of the reconstruction of River Hebert District High School, a commitment four years old with the funding in place - commitment and funding made by my predecessor, Mr. Murray Scott, the former member for Cumberland South who I had the great honour of succeeding, whose projects like that one I intend to see through regardless of where the resistance comes from, in the NDP or the school board as the case may be, for River Hebert residents.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there is a school, Primary to Grade 12 coming together, an economically vital piece of the community of River Hebert, Joggins and area with the funding already in the budget, half done when the hammer came down and the work stopped. It is not right that we have Nova Scotia students crawling over a construction zone to get into a half-finished school, where the tiles on the floor are all curled up from the mildew and the dampness and the moisture and, literally, the snow that comes into the school when it's snowing - or the gym that's as old as time itself. What message is the government sending to the students of River Hebert when they allow them to go to a school in that kind of disrepair, particularly when we know the funding is in place to finish the job?</p>
<p>There's nothing in the Throne Speech particularly about education that the people of River Hebert, Joggins and area can rely on when they look to their government to finish that school. I worked through the school closure process with my constituents in Wentworth with the Wentworth Consolidated School. If there was ever an example of how broken the school review process is it is on living display in the community of Wentworth Valley, where they have a school with a stable enrolment and actually the projection shows a slight growth in enrolment in the coming years, with a teacher-to-student ratio the same as any other school in the province, with a centrepiece building for the people in the Wentworth Valley to build their local economy around, forced to the brink of closure to save a few hundred thousand dollars. The burden of proof fell to the parents and residents of the Wentworth Valley up against hundreds of pages of reports prepared by high-priced consultants that were actually riddled with errors.</p>
<p>When the parents were able to successfully poke holes in those reports they were held back and frustrated as they tried to make their point. When they asked the school board and the Department of Education, itself, for information about the state of the school, its roof and so on they were told no, they can't have that information. I personally had to fall back to a freedom of information request to try to get the community the information it needed to counter the faulty report of the consultant that the school board had hired. Even that wasn't enough, parents spent hundreds of hours working to keep their school open.</p>
<p>I understand that the school board's money is for education. What gets missed is it's not for bureaucracy, it's for schools, classrooms and kids. When we tell the school board that we need that school to kick-start our community's economy, I understand why the school board would say, we're here to run schools, we're not the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism.</p>
<p>As we know in the Wentworth Valley and as I know many other rural communities are now seeing in living colour, that faced the same situation, it is about time that the left hand of government and the right hand of government knew what each other were doing and work together. On the one hand, the NDP has created this commission on the rural economy to go out and gather good ideas about how to kick-start our rural economy and I'm glad they did, I have met with that commission and have given them my own thoughts. I have encouraged them to get whatever they need from us or from anyone else to put together a good plan, we all want that.</p>
<p>Anyone who has thought about how to run a 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy is going to tell you that one of the cornerstones is a modern, decent, 21<sup>st</sup> Century education for our kids. How crazy is it that on the one hand we have a government with a commission looking for ideas to kick-start our small, rural community economies and on the other hand they are forcing the school boards to close schools in those same communities. That is an example of the right hand and the left hand of the NDP Government not knowing what each other is doing and only strong leadership can bring all the hands of government together in one, coherent whole and that is sorely missing and it is the communities of Bass River, of Wentworth, of Hebbville, of many other small communities across our province that are suffering because there is no vision in this Throne Speech, there is no plan to kick-start our rural economy in this Throne Speech and there is no thought to education other than cut, squeeze, less, and in all the wrong places by the way, which is at the small school level.</p>
<p>The government goes out of its way to point out the enrolment is declining, of course, it's declining, it goes out of its way to count up the square footage in those small, rural schools, it goes out of its way to produce graphs that show funding going up and enrolment going down. What they miss is that, whether you're in downtown Halifax or whether you're in Wentworth or River Hebert or in many other places, the teacher/student ratios don't vary that much. When you look at it that way, you realize that it should not matter where you live in this province, you deserve a decent, fair, public education. That's what has been lost in the last few years under the NDP. Certainly for the people of Cumberland South, there is nothing in this Throne Speech to show them anything different.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there's very little for seniors in this Throne Speech. The government has halted the long-term plans to create enough advanced care, long-term care beds for the needs of our growing population of seniors who need a higher level of care. They have said that the answer is home care and, of course, where that is available, where that is possible, where it can be done, that is part of the answer. For seniors who are able to and want to, we should stand by them so they can age in place in their own homes. Today in Nova Scotia, the wait list for long-term care for seniors who have been assessed as needing it, is higher than it has ever been in our history - 2,500 seniors are waiting for long-term care. Of that list, one-third are seniors who live in a part of the province where there is no home care available for them. They are doing what they need to do to get the care they need, with no help from the NDP.</p>
<p>Another one-third of that list are seniors who are actually in our hospitals, in our acute care facilities, waiting for a long-term care bed; I see some members laughing at that fact. I would invite them to visit the Sutherland Harris Memorial Hospital in Tatamagouche, which I did just recently. They will tell you, Madam Speaker, that in that 22-bed hospital there have been times this year where every single bed was occupied, not by someone in need of acute care but by a senior not admitted, just needing a bed and care until they got into long-term care, which surely at some point the government is going to learn is the least appropriate care at the most expensive price, when what they really need is long-term care.</p>
<p>In Cumberland South, in the community of Advocate, they have been waiting for two more beds - just two - for four years. The government came into office and they halted the call for tenders to construct those two beds. There are many residents of the Advocate area who have gone through the single-entry access system for assessment, Level 1, Level 2, who need long-term care and yet in that community they're still waiting. Those two, add to that long-term care waiting list, Madam Speaker, and it is not right. They don't just want to age in place, they want to age in their own community and for the cost of two beds, they have been told no.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, part of the financial tragedy of all this is that the community actually did their part; they raised a lot of money, sold real property, put the money in an account to help contribute to the cost of building those beds. They just need a government that will work with them to get it done, but that's not happening. There's nothing in this Throne Speech for the senior citizens of Cumberland South, particularly those who need advanced-level care.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, not just for Cumberland South, but for all Nova Scotia, I do want to point out the good chuckle that the government gave us in the Throne Speech the other day when they veered off into virtual reality - a little detour into the virtual world in the Throne Speech talking about NDP promises says they've "virtually" been kept.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know if their platform was recorded on an Xbox 360 or some other kind of virtual gaming system, but that has got to be one of the funniest lines yet recorded in a Throne Speech. I don't know what kind of virtual reality that statement came from, because in the real Nova Scotia voters remember the actual promises of the NDP - balance the budget and keep it balanced, first year; no tax increases; control government spending; keep our ERs open 24/7. The Premier, all his ministers, all the MLAs on the government side, they ran on those commitments, so to stand up now and say, well, we virtually kept them is actually an insult to the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>While I'm on it, Madam Speaker, there is something I want to table, because like every government before, the NDP like to use the same old excuse that they didn't realize how bad it was financially when they got in. What a sad excuse to use; Nova Scotians have heard that one too many times before.</p>
<p>I'm glad there is one honest member of the government over there when it comes to describing the finances of the province before the NDP came in, because I did read with great interest a letter to the editor in The Globe and Mail just last month about the finances of Nova Scotia. I actually hope the Premier reads it at some point because he might change his sorry excuses about why he can't keep his promises except in the virtual world. This letter to the editor was written in response to an attack on Nova Scotia by one of our own Liberal Members of Parliament, Mr. Brison, who went out of his way in Toronto to describe our province in very negative terms - something I would never encourage another Nova Scotian to do, by the way.</p>
<p>It's okay for us to debate in this House the state of the province; it's okay to do that. It's okay to debate in our kitchens and in our family rooms about the state of the province. As my dad used to say - when you're in Pictou County you're from Pictou or you're from New Glasgow, you can fight like cats and dogs, but the minute you go over Mount Thom you're all Pictou County residents. Well, the minute you cross the border, we're all Nova Scotians, and so I was disappointed to see that Liberal MP take such a hard shot at our province when he was out of province.</p>
<p>But that's not really the point, Madam Speaker. The point is that there was a very determined Nova Scotian who wanted to defend our province's financial record, who wrote a letter to The Globe and Mail talking about the state of our province's finances. I'll quote from it, and then I'll table it for all members to see, but this person wrote that "Nova Scotia's financial condition has greatly improved over the past decade." Well I think it's about time someone pointed that out, and I'm glad that this person did. In fact, they write, "The three deficits during this period have each been under 1 per cent of GDP."</p>
<p>Now what I find interesting about that is that in the past ten years it's true that there have only been three deficits, the three most recent ones, the three NDP ones - the seven before that, obviously the writer of this letter believes the seven before that were balanced. And I'm going to table that right now.</p>
<p>I just want to make clear for all members that the author of this letter is none other than the current Minister of Finance for our province, the member for Halifax Needham. I do want to take a moment and thank her for correcting the record, correcting the Premier's virtual storyline that, in fact, seven surpluses followed by three NDP deficits and that our position actually improved over the last 10 years. I will table that.</p>
<p>I know the member for Halifax Clayton Park is quite anxious to have a copy and I'd like her to. You see, Madam Speaker, the government's record is all wet and that's the point I'm trying to make.</p>
<p>In any event, just while I'm here, there is actually another honest member of the government over there, at least when it comes to the past - maybe not the budget just ended but at least when it comes to the past - because I heard the Premier say again, wrongly yesterday, that the NDP had inherited a big deficit when they came into office. In fact, I've seen their TV ads where he makes the same claim.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I happen to have the message from the minister for the Public Accounts, the audited financial statements of the government, for the year that the NDP came in. What's interesting is - I'll read it and then I'll table it - it says that the Public Accounts for the year ended March 31, 2009, reported a surplus of $19.7 million. (Interruption) Well, that's the very first sentence of the message from the minister.</p>
<p>Now what happened was after the year ended and before the minister was required to sign this confirmation of a surplus, the government did change and there was a new Minister of Finance. So the Minister of Finance who actually affixed his signature to this message that says there was a surplus is the previous Minister of Finance, the member for Halifax Fairview, so I will table that. They're getting quite a pile of these, I know, on the table but I think it's important that all members know that.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, while I'm in the habit of tabling things, I know we've been down this road before. Of course the government claims they inherited a deficit. We've proved over and over again, using their minister's own words that they didn't, so they changed the line. This is where we do get into the virtual world that the Throne Speech talked about, they changed their line. When we catch them they don't say it was a deficit, they made something up, they say okay, it was a structural deficit, as if there's any such thing.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, there's a whole set of rules called Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Everything is defined in them. You're not going to find the term "structural deficit" there. But what is more interesting is that the Auditor General has actually weighed in on this recently. I have the relevant page from the Auditor General's most recent report, which I will table in the hope that facts will actually trump virtual reality someday with this government. What the Auditor General says is, "The following exhibit &#x2026;", and he has a graph of all the surpluses and recent deficits, "&#x2026; shows the fluctuation in Nova Scotia's results over the past five years and does not indicate the existence of a structural deficit." The Auditor General ruled out any kind of structural deficit himself. They'll have to come up with a whole new term, maybe the virtual deficit as they have to shift their line yet again.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, on this same page which I am about to table, the Auditor General also reports the Province of Nova Scotia has incurred a surplus in eight of the past 10 years. Guess which two were not in surplus - the most recent two under the NDP. These are the words of the Auditor General, I'd be happy to table that.</p>
<p>I just think it's important that on the table should be all the documentation to refute this virtual world that the NDP live in and that they advertise in, so that Nova Scotians know for themselves that we have a government that came into office with a balanced budget, promising to keep it balanced and then didn't, promising not to raise taxes and then did, complained about power rates but then made them far worse. That's the virtual reality that the Throne Speech should have talked about.</p>
<p>I can even go on, Madam Speaker. We counted up the number of times the government attempted to pat itself on the back for all of the things that it has done to Nova Scotia over the past almost four years now. I'm sure there's a sprain over there somewhere, a tennis elbow or something from patting themselves on the back - 25 examples in a 17-page Throne Speech of a government attempting to pat itself on the back. The Throne Speech also has 25 pretty glaring holes in it of things the government did to Nova Scotia in the past four years that they chose not to talk about in their Throne Speech this week.</p>
<p>Number one - very importantly the Throne Speech neglected to mention that 6,400 Nova Scotians lost their jobs in the last year, 5,400 of them in the South Shore alone; that the unemployment rate on Cape Breton Island is 17.5 per cent; that there are some communities in Cape Breton where it's 30 per cent or more - and all of those numbers are up from before they came into office. For a government that likes to blame the worldwide recession, that somehow it's Greece's fault, or Cypress' fault, or Italy's fault, or Spain's fault, or someone else's fault - anybody's fault but theirs - the fact that they neglected to mention is that at the same time that the NDP lost 6,400 jobs, the rest of Canada gained 689,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Nine provinces went up, one province went down - that was not in the Throne Speech, but that is exactly what the government should be spending its time and energy on, fixing that, turning around our economy, kick-starting the economy of Nova Scotia instead of living in a world of virtual reality.</p>
<p>No deficit coming in - in fact, a surplus. The NDP threw the books into deficit, which is why no one is confident that it will truly be balanced next week - in addition to the $27 million. They are also getting more money from Ottawa than ever before in our province's history - $578 million more dollars and transfers to Nova Scotia now than five years ago. More money from Ottawa, borrowing all kinds of money and by raising the HST, by raising our taxes after promising not to (Interruptions) Madam Speaker, I hear people yelling EI, EI, do you know what would be great? A government that actually created jobs in Nova Scotia and focused on making real opportunities for people, instead of playing political games, like they are.</p>
<p>More money than ever before from Ottawa; $1 billion more in HST that they've collected; and $1.4 billion more in borrowing and they still can't balance the budget. I can't believe they would claim that they're happy with their financial record. With all of that extra money coming in in HST and in transfers from Ottawa and borrowing and they still can't balance the budget. When they find a mistake in their budget they try to hide that too - it's another $27 million, and all that ends up in more debt, all that ends up in more bills being handed on to our children to pay.</p>
<p>I got this insert in The ChronicleHerald the other day, the HeraldMagazine and there was a little baby Nova Scotian - I think it was a boy, but I didn't look closely enough to be sure, but I think it was a boy crying - with the headline that on his birth he was already, he or she, $14,008 in provincial debt. A lot of that has been piled up in the last four, short years. When we have a government that has a $27 million hole in their budget and won't fix it, and won't even tell us about it, what they lose sight of is that $27 million, that bill is passed on to that child, to that baby and every other Nova Scotian like him or her. That's why it's wrong to cover those things up because they're the ones that pay.</p>
<p>We have this commission now going around studying how to kick-start the economy. Thankfully we do, because clearly the government, the ones that people elected to manage the economy, they have no ideas about how to manage the economy or create jobs. They lost jobs while the rest of Canada was moving ahead. If you look outside Halifax, this province actually has its own home-grown recession now because the economy of rural Nova Scotia actually shrank last year - the very definition of a recession. The economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in 2012. That happened alone under the NDP, alone here in Nova Scotia, alone in rural Nova Scotia - an outright recession. They don't have to blame Greece or Cyprus or Europe; they've done their own job on the economy of rural Nova Scotia here at home, an outright shrinkage.</p>
<p>You know what? Nova Scotians are voting with their feet, that's why we actually had record out-migration. (Interruptions)</p></speech>

MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a great honour and privilege to stand here in my place to have an opportunity to speak in Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. First, I would like to take an opportunity to congratulate you on the role you have assumed in this place of great distinction. (Applause) I and my caucus colleagues look forward to working with you to make this the kind of House of Assembly that the people of Nova Scotia deserve and will rightfully feel privileged to have.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I also would like to say congratulations to the members of the government for their success following the election and, as well, to my colleagues to my right, the members of the Progressive Conservative caucus, on their success in the provincial election. Indeed, I'd like to take an opportunity to thank and congratulate all candidates from all of the Parties who threw their hat in the ring and did the heavy lifting that is the cornerstone of our democracy.</p>
<p>I think that although there may be differences in how we would solve certain problems in our province or order our priorities, the things we have in common are that common experience of believing in the democratic process, believing so fervently in it that we're prepared to enter into a very demanding kind of lifestyle and work life but we also share the privilege of going door-to-door in our particular constituencies, really being welcomed in a way that is like no other and learning probably more about the communities we live in and the aspirations and the challenges and the struggles and the triumphs of people in our constituencies than in any other profession that I can think of. So that is something that we hold in common irrespective of our ideology, or the political Party that we belong to, or the place that we occupy, or the place that we occupy here in this House of Assembly.</p>
<p>I want to take a moment to thank the people in my own constituency, the constituency of Halifax Needham. Mr. Speaker, I've been here for close to 16 years now and it has been a great honour and a great privilege to represent the people of primarily the north end of Halifax but a bit of the centre of the peninsula of Halifax and the inner city of the province's capital city. It is a fabulous, fabulous community of great diversity, of history that is as old as our province, and I am so honoured and humbled by the continuing support that I receive from the people in my constituency who have been so good to me over the time that I've been here.</p>
<p>I also want to take an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to thank my campaign team, all of whom I won't name, but I do feel I need to single out four or five of my campaign team whose efforts in this election - and previous elections as well - have been extraordinary and that would be my official agent, Mary Reardon; my sign guy, Brian Francis; my fundraiser, Lana MacLean; my riding association president, Cindy Hall; Kelsey Bennett, a new-found treasurer who has done a remarkable job for a novice; and all of the volunteers. I love you and I thank you so much for the support you've given me. I also want to thank my colleagues here in this caucus. I like to refer to us as the group of seven.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>That's right. We will be painting a landscape that is somewhat different than the landscape pieces of art that we know from the original Group of Seven but nevertheless we have and I have great aspirations for this group. We have a fair amount of experience in this small team and it is a privilege for me to serve with these members.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the election has altered the composition of this Legislature and the change in the composition of the House marks a change for the NDP from government to Opposition. One thing, however, that will not change for this Party is our focus on the needs of regular people in communities, rural, small town, urban settings across this province. Those will continue to be the priorities that this caucus will focus on.</p>
<p>We are very clear about what the job is that we have been sent here to do and that job is to hold government accountable for the priorities they set, the choices they make, the decisions they arrive at, and the impact of those decisions on people in the province in terms of the public good.</p>
<p>We sit here and we look at Joseph Howe who asked whether or not what is right, what is good, what is in the public good - is it right, is it good, is it in the public good? From the perspective of the Opposition, that certainly is the lens that we will look at, the actions and the decisions of our new government. It is our role to be critics but it is our role to be more than critics. It is also our role - and our caucus believes that it is our role - to bring practical solutions to the everyday problems that people can't reasonably be expected to solve individually. That is the role of government.</p>
<p>If you need health care and your income in no way would ever permit you to be able to afford that procedure, you pool your resources and you have a public health care system that allows care for all. That's fundamentally something that this Party and this caucus believes in.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, the new government begins a mandate with certain advantages that the former government did not enjoy. Four years ago, this province was in recession and just minimally coming out of recession in 2009. Revenue was down, department spending, particularly in the two largest departments of government, was far beyond its means. The Departments of Health and Wellness and of Education, which make up about 60 per cent of the province's expenditure, were spending anywhere between 6 per cent and 10 per cent more annually, year over year - a completely unsustainable scenario even in good economic times.</p>
<p>Economic growth in this province was the worst of any province in the country for 20 years. Energy costs were extraordinarily volatile and that's because previous governments had not done the heavy lifting around planning how to tackle the extraordinary dependence of this province for consumers, both individual households and industrial consumers, on fossil fuel consumption. There were few measures for conservation in place in an institutional, systematic way.</p>
<p>We had the worst student aid program in the country. We had among the highest tuition rates for university education in the country. ER closures across this province were very high. Out-migration of skilled workers was an ongoing problem. The underemployment and unemployment of youth in this province, like in provinces all across the country, was very, very high, and we had a changing population in terms of demographics.</p>
<p>The birth rate is very low in Nova Scotia and the retention or the replacement of people who are migrating out of the province with people coming in has shifted. The proportion of aging, elderly people is growing. These are just facts when you look at the demographics and the statistics.</p>
<p>This government begins its mandate on a much better path. ER closures are way down, primarily due to the development of the Collaborative Emergency Centres and the extreme improvements that have been made in primary health care clinics across the province, which give same-day or next-day access to a health care provider, taking the pressure off emergency rooms. Department spending across all departments, including Health and Education, has been brought under control. The public sector is leaner. It's more capable of living within its means. It has gone through a process where March madness has been eliminated and there is a much greater capacity to do longer-range planning in those departments.</p>
<p>In the Spring, this province saw the introduction of a balanced budget and a better credit rating, the first time in many, many years that the provincial bond credit rating was upgraded. All of the major financial institutions across the country have projected positive economic growth for our province in the not-too-distant future, some of that predicated on the understanding that the shipbuilding contract will lead to significant expansion of the province's GDP.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am so pleased to be able to stand here and acknowledge that poverty among senior citizens in our province has been reduced by 10 per cent. Food bank use in the Province of Nova Scotia has gone down. Today, Nova Scotia has the second-most progressive income tax system in the country, meaning those with the greatest ability to pay a bit more, pay a bit more.</p>
<p>There are still many challenges in front of the new government. Unquestionably, there are still problems. In four years no government of any Party can transform a province that has struggled economically and socially for many, many years. One of the greatest challenges that this government will face is the fact that over half of the households in this province, tax-filing households, live on household incomes of $30,000 or less. Highly skilled young people, young adults, are underemployed and unemployed, frustrated, and are leaving our province in droves.</p>
<p>The depopulation in rural parts of our province is placing a significant degree of pressure on both public- and private-sector enterprises. The growing proportion of seniors who require health care services who have inadequate income to purchase them privately but they're not available publicly, in the public system, is a significant problem.</p>
<p>The implications of the demographic shift for our schools, for our universities, for our community colleges, for our health care system are significant. So these are a few of the challenges - they're not all of the challenges - they're a few of the challenges that are in front of the new government as they would have been in front of any Party that formed government.</p>
<p>When I look at the state of the province and the challenges and I look at the Speech from the Throne, I'm concerned that the recognition of some of these challenges is not accentuated, it is not identified as clearly as it needs to be, particularly if the new government wants to fulfill the aspiration of being open and transparent and honest with the people of Nova Scotia. The first path to being open and transparent and honest is telling the true picture of what those challenges are to the people of the province. The Leader of the Official Opposition, I think, was quite correct in some of the points he made with respect to the expectations that Nova Scotians have for the new government.</p>
<p>I say with some regret, when I look at the government's strategic priorities on Page 2 in the Speech from the Throne, for example, just looking at the bullet pertaining to energy and electricity - what happened to the commitment with respect to affordability? This is going to be the test of the new government; the new government will be looked upon by the people in the province to fulfill their expectations. And with respect to electricity, their expectation is not that they have a whole bunch of choices that are all more expensive than what they currently are getting from Nova Scotia Power, they want affordability. They don't want expensive choices - they want affordable choices.</p>
<p>Fairness - exactly what does that mean? I have never heard people in my constituency, when they talk about their electricity bills, talk about fairness. They talk about cost. They talk about what the cost of electricity is, what is affordable for me and my family. These words have disappeared in 50-some days, and they need to be restored into the debate. I can assure you that as we move forward to discuss the cost of electricity and energy policy, this caucus will make sure that questions of affordability and cost will be part of that debate.</p>
<p>There are many important issues and initiatives that we will have many opportunities to discuss in this Chamber over the next number of days. I want to speak briefly to the question of collegiality and working relations, because the Premier has made a point of making this an important issue, and has offered the Opposition the possibility of working across this little divide here, this small patch of carpet. It's interesting - the sad thing in some ways about our system is that it is structured in an adversarial model. It's adversarial by nature - look at the way this Chamber is set up. That's the system we have.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that it's structured in an adversarial way and the government is given a row and the Opposition is given a row does not mean that people have to behave badly and treat each other badly. I know that my colleagues on this side, and I'm sure my colleagues on the other side, all agree that we want to elevate the debate to a debate around substance, around the issues, around the solutions. This is what Nova Scotians expect. They expect us to focus on the things that matter to them in a very adult way. They do not like the schoolyard behaviour, and neither do most of us who come to this place.</p>
<p>It's interesting - I think it is true that when you cross the floor you do see things somewhat differently. I want to be perfectly honest: we will approach this offer with some caution, because it wasn't that long ago that we sat in a different place here and had the experience of dealing with the Opposition. We look across the aisle - I look across the aisle, and I remember the first time I had to stand up and defend a Health budget. I was kept on my feet by the Opposition of the day for 25 hours, which was unprecedented. That had never occurred, and it hasn't occurred since.</p>
<p>I could go through a fair number of activities and things that happened - I think about emergency debates during H1N1, when the government was attempting to actually do the work of keeping people safe in what could potentially have been a very, very dangerous and deadly pandemic. We were here contributing to public hysteria about whether or not vaccine would be available for people who needed it.</p>
<p>We are more than willing to engage in constructive debate and to work with the government offering, as I said, practical solutions to the everyday problems that people can't reasonably be expected to solve on their own. But we do so with the hindsight of having been in a different position in this House and knowing how those collegial relations work and how they break down.</p>
<p>I would also add that one of the things we were disappointed in with the new government, in the spirit of collegiality, was the choosing of the deputy speakers. For two prior governments it has been the practice of previous governments to have members of Oppositions Parties occupy those positions. I hope and I will take the Premier at his word that he wishes and we all wish for more collegial relations. We will do our best to work in that direction, but sometimes actions are the basis on which you decide whether or not you can actually trust the sentiments that are being expressed.</p>
<p>I'm not going to belabour the various elements that I will have time to debate and we will all have time to debate as the government brings forward their legislative agenda. I'm looking forward to participating in those debates as my colleagues are looking forward to participating in those debates.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you on the role that you have been chosen for and I look forward to working with you, as does the NDP caucus in this session. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <p>Order, please. The honourable Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party has the floor.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you. It's because of this record of economic mismanagement that causes our economy to shrink while the rest of Canada goes ahead that Nova Scotians are voting with their feet, why thousands and thousands of our fellow citizens are working in places like Calgary and Fort McMurray and Toronto and other places. Not a single one of them would do that if there was a job for them here at home. Not a single family would choose to spend so much time apart if there was a job for them here at home. Not a single hockey team or Boy Scout troop or Girl Guide troop would go without a leader if those parents had a job here at home.</p>
<p>The Speech from the Throne has nothing to say to those people. In fact, one of the biggest glaring holes of all is how little there is about the most important issue of our time - how to kick-start the economy of the province and get Nova Scotia growing, all parts of Nova Scotia growing again. Even though they had the shipyard contract land in their laps, even though they had the offshore exploration start up again and land in their laps, their only response was to run TV ads taking credit for it instead of actually figuring out how to get Nova Scotians working and participating in those opportunities. You either know how to run TV ads and take credit for things or you know how to actually build a modern 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy and provide opportunities for people and they have shown which side they're on. In a few moments I will talk about which side we're on which is clearly to spend our resources on actually creating those opportunities for all Nova Scotians instead of taking credit for them.</p>
<p>The components of a modern 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy surely - I will pause for a moment. I understand there's an important introduction, I'm happy to yield for that.</p></speech>
        <speech by="#f0865fe1-8b9c-48db-8976-5544b7ccac27"><from>MS. JOYCE TREEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be standing here today in the House of Assembly, proudly responding to the Speech from the Throne. On behalf of the wonderful people of South Woodside, Cole Harbour and Eastern Passage, I bring warm greetings. Although the name of my riding is Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage, I added the name of South Woodside, as I want to acknowledge the people of this community.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment, I feel you will serve us well and have great admiration for your accomplishments and have great confidence in your abilities. (Applause)</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate all MLAs on their elections and the members of the Executive Council on their ministerial appointments. This is a government of diversity, strength, and hard workers, what Nova Scotia itself is made of. I feel a bright future for our province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my first thank you must go to my husband, Joe, and my son, Ryder, for without their support, my decision to run would have been different. I am blessed to have never received a complaint from them during the long days of election campaigning and during my now busy schedule. I don't know what they ate while I campaigned, because my husband does not cook, but they are still alive, and I love them both very much. (Laughter) Thank you to my mom and my dad, and my family for their unending support. A special thanks to my mom, Colleen, for keeping my campaign team fed - a typical Cape Bretoner. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my campaign manager, Angela LaPierre, who did not hesitate to jump on board and lead my team. She put her life on hold during the campaign without a thought. She has the most cheerful, optimistic personality and can bring a smile to anyone's face. Angela, don't move, I will be calling you in four years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the rest of my team as well. I had a great group of people with very little political experience. They all learned their roles quickly and performed like champions. My team included Jan, Louise, Carla, Jessica, Kim, Ruth, Sally, Margie, and our three men were Matt, Geoff, and Lance. I would like a thank you also to go out to my telephone and door canvassers, people who displayed my signs, and the people who brought us food so we did not go hungry. I have a special thanks for Kristen Hines who provided me with guidance, kindness, and sanity; Mr. Premier, she is a keeper.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the people of South Woodside, Cole Harbour, and Eastern Passage who voted for me and contributed financially to my campaign. I thank them all from the bottom of my heart and I will do my best not to disappoint. The job of MLA for Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage is an exciting and challenging opportunity for me. I have said during the campaign and I will say it now, that I believe our Premier will guide and lead the people of Nova Scotia to a wonderful future where people are always put first. (Applause) But we have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a little bit about my riding of Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage. My riding is a combination of three independent, proud communities: South Woodside; Cole Harbour, which includes Millbrook First Nation; and Eastern Passage, which includes CFB Shearwater and Cow Bay. South Woodside is the smallest community in my riding. As small as it is, the people are rich in spirit and strong in community and they have the most beautiful gardens surrounding their homes. South Woodside is home to Imperial Oil which has employed many residents of my riding for decades. The South Woodside elementary school has an attached community centre that supports the local residents. This community is also home to Pizza Time which serves the best pizza in town.</p>
<p>Cole Harbour is a large community of which I represent only a small portion. Historically it is a very rich farming community that has grown into a large residential community. It has three wonderful schools with a very strong community presence in all: Astral Drive Elementary, Astral Drive Junior High, and Caldwell Road Elementary School. Cole Harbour is also home to the Millbrook Reserve, which was established in 1918 on the old Creelman property on the Caldwell Road. The Kinsmen Park was recently built and is adjacent to this reserve and provides walking trails and water access to the Morris Lake.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Cole Harbour and Eastern Passage is also home to a section of the Trans Canada Trail between Caldwell Road in Eastern Passage and the Bissett Road in Cole Harbour. It is known as the Salt Marsh Trail and it is popular with walkers, runners, hikers, cyclists and naturalists. This trail was built in the 1980s on the abandoned Musquodoboit rail corridor and has become a well-used rail trail. This trail system is also part of the Cole Harbour Heritage Park. Although this park is only partially in my riding, it covers 400 acres and is made up of many trails, open fields and heritage features.</p>
<p>Cole Harbour is also home to Bissett Lake, which is being carefully cared for by the residents who built homes adjacent to it. This conservation effort speaks to the caring nature of its residents.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the largest community of my riding is Eastern Passage, my home of 37 years. Located at the mouth of Halifax Harbour it is named for the waterway between the mainland and two of the islands in my riding. Eastern Passage dates back to the 1750s. One of the first land grants was issued in 1752 and then was transferred in 1798 to a Jacob Horn - no "e" - one of the first settlers. One of Jacob Horn's descendants, Bill Horne, is MLA for Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank; he spells his name with an "e". Surnames of some of the original settlers still live in the area: Naugle, Romkey, Hartlen, Soward, Horne, Cleary, Negus, DeYoung, Fraser, Osborne, Himmelman, Moser, Edwards, Bowes, McKenzie and York.</p>
<p>Agriculture was a major source of income in Eastern Passage in the early years. In 1851 the population quadrupled to 661 people when fishing became an equally important source of income. In 1942 Eastern Passage's waterfront, including the Quigley's Corner area, was devastated by a fire which destroyed most of the buildings and docks that all had to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, McCormack's Beach is a provincial park in my riding. This is the location of the infamous passage of the Tallahassee, a Confederate State blockade runner during the American Civil War. She escaped through the narrows in the middle of the night, led by only a single harbour pilot in a small rowboat, lighting his way with an oil lantern. The Tallahassee successfully escaped the union cruiser's ambush that night. The community school in my area is named for this vessel, the Tallahassee Community School.</p>
<p>Today it is a beach with a very popular ocean boardwalk flowing into the tourist destination of Fisherman's Cove. If you want the best fish and chips around, come to the Wharf Restaurant. Fisherman's Cove is also home to the Crick, the historic and still very active fishing wharves.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to mention, along with Tallahassee, the three other great schools in my riding: Eastern Passage Education Centre, Ocean View Elementary, Seaside Elementary and our soon to be constructed high school that will complete our educational needs for our community. We are fortunate to have a strong spirit and devoted support from our communities in our schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my riding is also home to three islands: Devil's Island, McNabs Island and Lawlor Island. Devil's Island is a small, privately-owned island at the mouth of Halifax Harbour that received its name from a former owner named Deval. It also used to have a lighthouse that guided all the boats into the harbour. Twenty-eight families used to live on the island at one time; it was a very busy fishing community. Now it is totally barren and no one lives there except the ghosts from all the stories told.</p>
<p>McNabs Island and Lawlor Island Provincial Park is also at the mouth of Halifax Harbour. Lawlor Island is located across from MacCormack's Beach. It was once used for farming, a hospital and as a quarantine station. Lawlor is also home to a colony of great blue heron and many osprey. This island is not open to visitors. Now, McNabs Island still has several privately-owned residences and is the home of Fort McNab National Historic Site of Canada, which was very important in the defence of Halifax Harbour. Today the park is open to visitors. Walking trails, cycling, beach access and no-trace camping are all there for people to enjoy. During the summer months the inlet between these two islands is a popular stop for boaters. The island is home to a lot of wildlife, including deer, rabbit, coyote, and 206 documented species of birds. Mr. Speaker, this park is a gem in the harbour and needs to be promoted more as a place to visit and experience.</p>
<p>Eastern Passage is also home to the Hartlen Point Golf Club, an incredible 18-hole course with spectacular ocean views. Another historical fact: did you know that after the Halifax Explosion, the blocks used to build the now famous Hydrostone structures were constructed in Eastern Passage?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, another important area of my riding is CFB Shearwater, a military base with land, sea and air access. It is viewed as a very important military asset because of these three components. My riding is home to many members of the Canadian Armed Forces and their families. It is important that all Nova Scotians be thankful for and recognize the sacrifices of our military men, women, and families. We are proud of them all. They are a very valuable part of our communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Cow Bay is a little hamlet connected to Eastern Passage. Cow Bay is not named for the cows that used to line its road but after the resident to which the first land grant was issued, Robert Cowie. Between 1840 and World War II, gold was mined in Cow Bay, and it was discovered by Al Negus. It also used to be a summer resort area complete with dance halls and cottages. Today it is known for the last standing statue from its resort glory days - the moose. Yes, I said the moose, a 15-foot statute of a bull moose.</p>
<p>Cow Bay is also home to another provincial park - Rainbow Haven Beach. This is an extremely popular summer location to many local people and visitors. Fine sand and a warm shallow bay make it a popular destination on a warm summer day. Cow Bay is also home to the new surf park, the Minutes. This park was the brainchild of the local surfers and is a huge draw for people from all over the world who want to surf our waters.</p>
<p>Also I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the hardworking and committed volunteers within my riding. Their dedication is one of the things that make this riding so great. So, Mr. Speaker, you can tell by the history of my riding and all the breathtaking sights it possesses, being only 10 minutes from the city, its rural feel and strong sense of community make it unique and one of Nova Scotia's best kept secrets.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in closing I would like to say again how proud I am to be representing my riding of Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage. I will work hard, I will listen carefully and I will work together with my constituents to make our riding and our province a better place to live. A job worth doing is a job worth doing well. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>I am delighted to see the son of the member for Halifax Clayton Park here and would like to welcome him on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party as well. I'll talk to him later about the YPCs and see if we have a chance with him. (Laughter)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the components of a modern, 21<sup>st</sup> Century economy, to make it grow, are self-evident to us, but clearly lost on the government, and the Liberals, too, now that I think about it. The components of growing an economy today include lower taxes for everyone, affordable power, frozen power rates for everyone with no special deals. They include stopping wasteful government spending, and directing our resources to important front-line services. And, in order to build a successful modern economy, you need a 21<sup>st</sup> Century, world-class public education system. The very thing that they have cut is not only a right of all young Nova Scotians, but an important part of building a modern economy.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, how crazy is it that in a time of declining enrollment that there were still so many young Nova Scotian students in Primary, and Grades 1, 2, and 3 - our earliest grades - going to school in classes with 30 or more kids in them this past September? That takes a special kind of mismanagement, in a time of declining enrolment, to pull that off. That's what happened this past September and hopefully it will not reoccur, but there is nothing in the Throne Speech to tell Nova Scotians we won't see another example of that when the school year gets underway again next September.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I spoke a moment ago about the community schools in my riding. But the same is true of the small, rural community schools in many parts of Nova Scotia that find themselves on a school review list, that find themselves being closed as recently as last night, or in the upcoming year, and the Throne Speech is silent on the process that allows these things to happen. The process of reviewing these schools is broken. It doesn't take into account the economic needs of those communities, who need a school at the heart of the community to kick-start that economy and start growing the local area again. A government that sees these problems would actually say in the Throne Speech they're going to change that process. But that's not what they say. Their silence speaks volumes.</p>
<p>And in our hospitals, where budgets are limited, where there's no new money for health, we already know that, they continue to support 10 health authorities and 10 CEOs, and dozens of vice-presidents and hundreds of managers, and thousands of directors, while important services go wanting. You know, you walk into an emergency room in Nova Scotia today, Madam Speaker, you may not see a doctor, but you are definitely going to trip over a vice-president or two on your way in the door. They have made their priorities for health care funding very clear, which is with all those administrators sitting in offices and not in ERs. Nova Scotians have seen that.</p>
<p>What they now know is that the Minister of Education and his government believe that giving money to Tim Hortons outlets in our hospitals is, in some twisted way, spending on health care. And we've raised this before, that in the Tim Hortons here at the Capital Health district, the government directs them to spend $1.4 million a year subsidizing those Tim Hortons - they tell them to do it. Even the executives of Capital Health have said, we don't want to spend that money there anymore, we would rather spend it on important services. They put that in their business plan four years in a row, and four years in a row, the Minister of Health and Wellness has said, no, you have to keep spending that money on Tim Hortons, and we will count it as part of health spending. Well, it is not health spending, it is a subsidy of coffee, of all things, Madam Speaker, of Tim Hortons coffee, and they lose $1.4 million a year doing it. (Interruption)</p>
<p>So, the time has come to cut off the Tim Hortons coffee altogether, cut off the subsidy altogether. Don't call that health care spending, it is not health care spending - redirect that money into something useful. We have made the suggestion that that money could actually buy an insulin pump for every single Nova Scotian child who needs one, who has diabetes and could benefit from an insulin pump. I will say that we're all getting the hint from the Throne Speech that there may be something coming and I sure hope that's true because spending money on Tim Hortons when we could be spending on insulin pumps is pretty important.</p>
<p>There are political Parties out there that call on the government to spend money on things over and over and over, but never point out how they would pay for it. The Liberal Party of Nova Scotia would be an example of that. Spend, spend, spend, and say you want to balance, say you're willing to make the tough decisions, but don't actually do it - spend and spend. But when it comes to these insulin pumps, where we are different from the Liberals and NDP is we actually found the money to pay for those insulin pumps. That's a test of whether you can govern or not - we actually found the money and they didn't and neither did they, but I hope they do. So if that's the hint of what's to come that's good and I hope they live up to it.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, yesterday the government actually played a pretty sad sleight of hand on our small businesses. They felt free to announce they were reducing the small business tax by 0.5 per cent, but left out the little detail that the threshold to qualify for it was going to be smaller. In their own announcement, they said they were cutting the tax but it wouldn't cost the government anything. That can only be true if they are giving with one hand and taking with the other.</p>
<p>The same is true with their announcement that they want to create five doors for business. The problem, as we learned from that old show <i>Let's Make a Deal</i>, is you never know what's behind door number one. But what we do know, in the case of Nova Scotia, is when we have a business wanting to expand here, or wanting to open, or wanting to locate here, when they do open that surprise door number one, what they find is the highest power rates, and the highest taxes, and a whole lot of regulations, and administrative penalties, and other things that get in their way. Madam Speaker, that is not going to help turn the economy of rural Nova Scotia around.</p>
<p>Today's announcement about user fees is not going to help either because it got a little bit more expensive this year, this week, to live and work in Nova Scotia. The government's defence that the user fees are going up by the amount of inflation is laughable when we know that inflation is the highest in all of Canada here because of what they have done to our power rates, what they have done to our taxes, what they have done to the cost of everyday items - up, and up, and up - and to use that as justification for also hiking our user fees is clear evidence to Nova Scotians why it's very expensive under an NDP Government.</p>
<p>No one knows better than the people of Cumberland County about the impact of user fees in the local economy because it is there that the Liberals put the toll highway in and not a single Liberal has been elected in Cumberland County since, and won't be for a long time and I hope that the NDP gets the message that the risk that they are taking because of the record of the Liberals in that part of the province.</p>
<p>With those few words, Madam Speaker, I will adjourn the debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne for today.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#16c306ab-30c7-40a9-8c13-d2d2aafda27d"><from>MR. ALLAN ROWE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what an honour and a privilege it is to stand before you and the rest of this House this morning to offer a few comments in response to our government's Speech from the Throne as delivered by His Honour the Lieutenant Governor.</p>
<p>Before going any further, Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to congratulate all of the members of this House on their election to the Legislature on October 8<sup>th</sup>. Many on both sides of this Chamber are very experienced individuals returning with many years of experience. For many others however, myself and yourself, Mr. Speaker, included, this is our first time sitting in these honoured Chambers. It is my sincere hope and my expectation that going forward we will all work together, combining our experience, our exuberance, our traditions, our innovations, our political positions, and our aspirations for the benefit of our province and all of our constituents.</p>
<p>I'd also like to take a moment to recognize my fellow candidates in this recent election: Ms. Mary Vingoe, who ran for the NDP; Mr. Gord Gamble, who ran for the Progressive Conservatives; and Mr. Jim Murray, who ran as an Independent. Ours was an extremely clean and cordial campaign on all fronts, and I thank them all for their professionalism and for putting their names forward in the first place.</p>
<p>If I may beg this House's indulgence for just a few moments, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a little bit of time to thank some of the people who were so instrumental in helping me with my election campaign, from being nominated as a candidate back in February all the way to my successful election as the MLA for Dartmouth South, beginning first and foremost with my campaign manager, Mr. Vishal Bhardwaj. A proud East Indian immigrant to Canada, Vishal represents everything that our province and our nation stand for: a home to those who were born here, as well as those who come here from other countries, who simply want to educate and improve themselves, who want to work, who want to live and raise their families in comfort and in safety. It is a true testament to those ideals that Vishal, his wife Shelly, their children Reva and Rasik, and his mother and in-laws all take such an active role in the politics of our province and country, including helping so much with my campaign.</p>
<p>I'm also particularly grateful to Cathy Conrad, a personal friend of my wife's and mine, who from early in March right up until the eve of election day canvassed virtually every street in our wonderful riding of Dartmouth South with me. Cathy and I knocked on some 8,000 doors, and we met many thousands of constituents - some of them two and three times over. Cathy and I can now instantly direct you to the steepest streets, the longest driveways, the highest hills, and the highest front doors virtually anywhere in our riding, and there are a lot of them.</p>
<p>We made friends with countless dogs and cats as well. We were invited in, and on rare occasions, invited not so politely to leave. Ultimately, I could never have achieved my goal of meeting as many of our constituents as possible without Cathy's help, and I thank her. I must also thank my official agent, Doug Livingstone, whose advice, guidance, and stern hand kept our campaign on the impeccable path which I and the rest of my team are so proud of.</p>
<p>There are so many other people who played a part whose roles I haven't really got time to go into in detail at this point, but I need to at the very least mention and publicly thank them for their efforts, including Barb and Bernie Hart, Terie and Charlie Berube, Terry Beard, Peggy Landes, Iain Macleod, Brian Churchill, Tracy Preeper, Mark Hubley, Linda Tweedie, Cora Lee Murrin-Beauchamp, and Jane Cordy. Again, there are dozens more, but I won't take any more time of the House's at this opportunity to mention them by name. I still want to thank them for their efforts and their assistance.</p>
<p>I think it's important to point out that, other than Cathy Conrad, all of the aforementioned people are people I only met after declaring my intention to seek nomination. For over 30 years I was a radio and television journalist. Throughout my career - like most of my former colleagues, I might add - I took great pains to try and avoid displaying any political preferences. I've always believed that impartiality and objectivity are the hallmarks of journalistic integrity. As a result, political associations and relationships were virtually non-existent for me prior to indicating I was going to run for office. As well, it was an old friend of mine, who actually sits in our Cabinet now as a government member, who convinced me to run for this position in the first place.</p>
<p>I say all of this merely to point out how appreciative I am of all of the people who put so much faith and confidence in me without really knowing me. As I've told all of them before, I only hope that I can truly live up to all of their expectations.</p>
<p>As others have already pointed out so well in this House, when a person decides to run for public office, members of their family become as involved in the proceedings as the candidates themselves. In fact, it might be said that family members often make even greater sacrifices. With that in mind, I must say a very special thank you to my wife, Yvonne. (Applause)</p>
<p>My true soulmate, Yvonne has been with me through so many trials, tribulations, and celebrations over the past 36 years or so. Together we have seen good times and we've seen bad times; we have weathered financial ups and downs; and there have been trying times at work. There have been celebrations of marriages and births; we have buried all of our parents; and we have buried two of Yvonne's siblings. Yvonne has survived breast cancer, diabetes, and vascular disease, and I have beaten prostate cancer - having had my prostrate removed just a year ago. (Applause) Since the very first day we met I have been in love with Yvonne, and I can honestly say I do not know what I would do without her.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Yvonne and I have a truly amazing daughter, Deborah, who now lives in Kanata, Ontario, with her husband Nick and their two children - our nine-year-old grandson, Michael, and our three-year-old granddaughter, Hope. I was so fortunate to have our daughter and grandson actually come to Dartmouth to spend the final days of the campaign and election night with us. I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful and supportive wife and family.</p>
<p>I mentioned how we have buried all of our parents. I can't help but take a moment to pause and reflect on how proud I hope my mom and dad, Gus and Grace Rowe, would be of me today. I was adopted by them when I was two and a half years old. Dad, a Newfoundlander, was serving overseas with the Newfoundland Regiment during World War II when he met my mom in Glasgow; in fact they were actually married in Glasgow during the Blitz. After the war they moved to Newfoundland and Labrador and later to Hamilton, Ontario, where they adopted me and, shortly after, an infant girl as well - my sister now lives in New Brunswick with her family.</p>
<p>Although dad passed away over 16 years ago and my mom nearly eight years ago, I can still see them smiling lovingly from the gallery. I was also fortunate enough to meet my birth mother, Louise Harding, a few years ago before she, too, passed away. I never met my birth father, Henry Barclay, who was apparently born in Stellarton and worked in the coal mines before marrying Louise, who was from New Brunswick, and the two of them moving to Hamilton, Ontario, as it turned out, where I and three other siblings were born. It is my sincere hope that they both now realize that their decision to put me, the youngest child, up for adoption was one that was indeed the right one. I owe all of my parents so very, very much.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I began my remarks by mentioning my campaign manager, Vishal Bhardwaj, and as I look around at my honoured colleagues throughout this House on both sides, I can't help but marvel at the diversity that is represented here. We range in age from our 20s to our - okay, well let's just say considerably older. We represent a wide variety of ethnic, cultural and religious groups and sexual orientations. There are parents, there are single parents, there are grandparents. Some of us are married; some of us are single.</p>
<p>We have come from all walks of life. There are educators, there are legal practitioners, there are health practitioners, labourers, business persons and retailers. We have lobbyists, student leaders, scientists, economists and yes - dare I say - even journalists. For all of our differences, Mr. Speaker, what we all share is the fact that the majority of our constituents in each of our respective ridings believe that we were the best people to speak for them and represent them in this Legislature. They have entrusted us with the responsibilities of enacting laws, controlling the purse strings, watchdogging government, and providing a public forum for all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Let there be no mistake, Mr. Speaker, these responsibilities are neither easy nor frivolous. As to the former, I'll make a few comments on our government's plans to shoulder responsibilities as outlined in our Speech from the Throne in just a few moments. First, I want to speak to the latter, the importance and the onerousness of these responsibilities. Just a few weeks ago, like many of my colleagues in this House, I had the honour of laying a wreath at Sullivan's Pond at the cenotaph in Dartmouth as part of the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies. That was a time to remember and honour all of those who have served in our Canadian Forces and paid the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of freedom and democracy, the reason that we are all sitting here in these Chambers this afternoon. We have more than just a job to do in these Chambers - we have the responsibility of ensuring that those who gave their lives didn't do so in vain, by working together to better the lives of all Nova Scotians regardless of race, colour, creed, or political affiliation.</p>
<p>As to our plans as a government, the Throne Speech delivered by His Honour the Lieutenant Governor provides a very clear insight into our intention to move our province forward. Already I have heard it suggested by some members opposite "There's nothing really new in this Speech from the Throne," that previous governments have said much the same thing when they outlined their intentions but subsequently failed to deliver. I tell you this: every single member on this side of the House is committed to doing all that they can to deliver everything put forward in our Speech from the Throne. (Applause)</p>
<p>We intend to improve the lives of Nova Scotians by ensuring true consumer choice and fairness in the provision of electricity; enhancing support for employee training and skills development; assisting our entrepreneurs, young and old; reinvesting in our school system; realigning our health care to put patients and families first; and investing in our communities to better the lives of our seniors, people with disabilities, and for those in need as well.</p>
<p>These are, indeed, ambitious plans and goals which my government has outlined, but they are plans and goals that can and will be achieved.</p>
<p>My riding of Dartmouth South represents an ideal sampling of everything our province has to offer. We have young and small entrepreneurs establishing bakeries, restaurants, galleries, and specialty retail outlets in our downtown. We have artists, performers, musicians, playwrights, and authors all presenting their works at venues throughout our riding in places like schools, church halls and, of course, Alderney Landing. We have museums and art galleries. We have dozens of historical buildings and sites highlighted by things like Evergreen House, the old City Hall, the Starr skate factory, and our wonderful Shubenacadie Canal system. We have schools, parks, ball fields, and community centres, and we have youth programs. We also have seniors' centres and seniors' complexes. We have the Dartmouth General Hospital, which has the potential to be a provincial if not national leader in the field of specialized surgeries.</p>
<p>The riding of Dartmouth South is a vibrant and growing riding. It is no different from the ridings of each and every one of my colleagues on both sides of this House.</p>
<p>For those communities like mine to continue to grow and to develop, to attract new businesses and families, to improve their individual economies and thereby the economy of our province and region as a whole, it requires an understanding and responsible government. It requires a government that will listen before deciding what action has to be taken and what needs to be done, and then after listening, taking that action and moving on what needs to be done. It requires a government that is led by vision, guided by principle, and acts on compassion. I believe the Speech from the Throne makes it clear that Nova Scotia has elected such a government. (Applause)</p>
<p>In closing this morning, I am proud to say I am part of that government. I am proud of our Leader. I am proud of the team that he has assembled and I am proud to be the voice of Dartmouth South in this Legislature. I look forward to working and co-operating with my colleagues on both sides of these respected Chambers to better the lives of my constituents and all Nova Scotians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Hants East.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#0b7af00d-43e4-452a-84f1-4e982155e7de"><from>MS. MARGARET MILLER</from><p>Good morning, Mr. Speaker. My colleague has made this so tough. Absolutely, what a wonderful speaker. It is indeed an honour to be here today in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly before my honourable colleagues and I'm honoured to have earned the privilege of representing the people of the beautiful riding of Hants East.</p>
<p>I stand here before you today with mixed emotion: excitement, gratitude, hope, and even in peace. Excitement because I'm able to help the people of Hants East, and indeed the people of Nova Scotia, as we work to ensure that this newly formed government under the leadership of our honourable Premier works with Nova Scotians to make this province a place we are all proud to call home, a place where all men and women are equal and everyone has the opportunity to live their best life, raise a family, or even retire - secure in the knowledge and belief that their government is working hard on their behalf. Excitement as I think about Hants East, its diversity, and all the possibilities for our future.</p>
<p>Hants East is a large riding and if you were in the Mount Uniacke area you would be captivated by the abundance of lakes and beautiful countryside. The people in the area welcome visitors, and if you stop at the Lakeland Variety, you may be served by Delores Arsenault, a true treasure in the area.</p>
<p>Visitors to the area should also consider going to Bell Park and hiking out to the lake - it's truly beautiful. I spent a few campaign days there sharing a lunch - or taking the road from Mount Uniacke north until you get to the Rawdon area. It is also a beautiful Sunday drive through rural Nova Scotia. The area was all settled in the early days by United Empire Loyalists after the American Revolution. One of the most prominent settlers was a Captain James Bond; there is still a James Bond in Rawdon today.</p>
<p>Much of the Kennetcook area was settled at the same time. Another of the United Empire Loyalists was a George Miller who was granted a large parcel of land that became known as the Township of Douglas. George Miller was the five-times-great-grandfather of my husband, and Robert is proud to have been born on that early homestead that is now known as Northfield in Hants County.</p>
<p>This area is now home to the province's largest Mennonite community. In the 1980s, two colonies of conservative Mennonites, more than 30 families, planted themselves in Northfield after purchasing more than 2,000 acres of land from the Oland family. You will find these hard-working immigrant families at farm markets all through the province.</p>
<p>The Kennetcook area also hosts a wonderful festival every summer that celebrates its heritage and its future. I would further like to commend Marsden Anthony, a long-time resident of this village, who owns at least four to five businesses in this small community, and the community would not be the same without his support.</p>
<p>Yet further north, Mr. Speaker, you will come to the Hants Shore. This area of the province has so much unrealized potential with unlimited vistas of beaches, the Bay of Fundy, and much more. This area could be a kayaker's dream, a camping, biking, or touring Mecca. Explore the quaint Walton and the Walton Wharf, or marvel at the coastline shores. No one should miss a drive through Burntcoat, amazingly the sight of the world's highest tides. Not Nova Scotia's, not North America's, but the world's highest tides, and yet there is little signage or advertising that promotes this natural attraction.</p>
<p>Imagine how the power of tourism dollars - and maybe I should address this to the minister - could transform this area into a prosperous part of Nova Scotia. Think of the jobs that could be created. We have the highest tides in the world and we sit in almost silence instead of shouting it out to the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, no description of Hants East would be accurate without mentioning Maitland. Maitland was named after Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in 1828. In the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, fortunes were made in Maitland in shipbuilding and with the sale of lumber, and today one can still admire the stately homes and lovely farmhouses built at the time. This rich, historic past was recognized in 1995 when Maitland was declared Nova Scotia's first Heritage Conservation District and, Mr. Speaker, you would enjoy stopping in to see the art at the local Gallery 215, or stop for lunch at Bing's Eatery.</p>
<p>Lawrence House is also in Maitland and sits on a bluff overlooking the Bay of Fundy. It is a provincial museum that houses artifacts and memorabilia about <i>W.D. Lawrence</i>, the largest wooden ship ever built in Canada. The house is now a national historic site and features two large, formal Victorian parlours with original furnishings from the period.</p>
<p>Maitland, Mr. Speaker, could be so much more. There are so many possibilities. When I'm in Maitland I don't see the old store that needs work; I see the oldest general store in North America. I don't see a waterfront with varied limited access; I visualize a waterfront boardwalk and park. Bed and breakfasts that are now empty should be full. The restaurants should be busy and locals in historic costumes should be celebrating their passion for the historic status of the village. I see it as a destination for tourists and all Nova Scotians alike. But the unfortunate truth is that like so many other small villages, Maitland is in decline. There is no bank, no access to gasoline, and now residents are afraid their small school will soon be closed.</p>
<p>The Shubenacadie River is the western border of my constituency. Since the beginning of the province and its true first Canadians, the Mi'kmaq people, this river has been a valued resource. It provided transportation to those early people. Later shipbuilding was the key to the area and now tourists ride the bore as waves take them on the ride of their lifetime.</p>
<p>I'm very proud to say that my dad was the first person to start commercial river rafting on the Shubenacadie River. He was a Dutch immigrant who came to Nova Scotia in 1953 through Pier 21. He had always heard local fishermen talking about getting caught in the bore, and after experiencing it himself, he believed that everyone should have that experience, but as an entrepreneur he just wanted them to pay for it. Now it's one of the top tourist attractions in the province.</p>
<p>Then there is Shubenacadie, my home and where my husband and I had a dairy farm for 25 years. The rolling hills and sweeping vistas of farmland are always beautiful; add it to the river valley and it's absolutely spectacular. Actually, our former farm location is now the Links at Penn Hills golf course. Also, the community of Shubenacadie has a small museum called the Tin Smith Shop. Dating back to the 1890s, the building was used continuously as a milk can fabrication facility and a hardware store until the year 2000. Its late owner, Harry Smith, left the property to the community who converted the building into a museum. Shubenacadie is also known as the milk can capital of North America - I bet you didn't know that.</p>
<p>Sadly, our history has not always been positive. Shubenacadie is also the location of the Canadian residential school that was operated from 1923 to 1967 by two Roman Catholic orders. This was the only Native residential school in Atlantic Canada, and as a child I remember walking past the school on Sunday after Sunday school and watching the children at play, thinking how much fun it would be to be there playing with them. We all know better now. The school was destroyed by a fire in 1986.</p>
<p>Nora Bernard, a Mi'kmaq activist, attended the school for five years, and later in life was directly responsible for what became the largest class action lawsuit in Canadian history and compensated an estimated 79,000 survivors of the Canadian residential school system. Victims of this school and many others are still today dealing with the irreparable harm done to their families, their self-esteem, and their culture. Many survivors and their families still live in Indian Brook, just on the outskirts of Shubenacadie.</p>
<p>But there is new promise in our village because grape growing has become viable in the area. The whole river coastal area has the possibility of sustaining a viable vineyard industry. And to mention a different kind of beverage, the largest portion of the milk produced in Nova Scotia is also produced in Hants East. We have some of the best farmland in the province, and some of the best farmers are here as well.</p>
<p>The villages that follow the Shubenacadie River are all linked to the old stagecoach and rail routes of days gone by. Milford Station was originally named Wickwire after its original settlers; however, John Wardrope suggested the new name in 1860 because of the presence of various mills in the area.</p>
<p>In 1857 the Nova Scotia Railway main line from Richmond to Truro opened, passing through the community along the west bank of the Shubenacadie River - hence the term "station" in the community's name. Driving through Milford Station you can see the Wickwire House still there today. Milford Station is primarily a service area for the local farming community, and given its location along Highway No. 102, it has a growing residential population and is exhibiting exurban characteristics.</p>
<p>Still, Milford is real country, and according to my sources, there is a six-to-one ratio of cows to people in Milford Station and the Hardwood Lands area.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after leaving the community you will find a distinct change in the landscape. Lantz is a community defined by brick. Just driving along the main road, you will be able to see that all the older homes are made of brick. It's interesting to note that the first brick school was built in Lantz in 1945. Today it's a thriving area, with subdivisions ever expanding to accommodate the growing number of people moving to the countryside and commuting to the city.</p>
<p>You will find much of the same through Elmsdale and Enfield. All the local citizens are working hard to keep some of the historic features of their community. The area is growing very quickly, and the East Hants Municipality has the challenge of meeting the needs of the population surge. Still, it's exciting to see the growth, the support for local business, and the promise of bigger things to come. For all of this I am so grateful.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have much to be grateful for: a very supportive husband who has helped make all my dreams come true, who supported me in my bid to become MLA for Hants East by putting up 800 signs during the campaign - and better yet, he even took them all down; and my daughters, Monica and Jeanette, and their unwavering support. I'm grateful to my friend Jennie Bignell, who convinced me that this was to be my future. She made me see that I had something to offer the people of Hants East. My campaign manager, Nancy Sweeney, a young woman with passionate energy. Despite having a full-time job, she gave her time and experience to the campaign. I would like to thank my official agent, Geri Slade, who took this most important role and simply performed miracles. I would like to thank Mona Hawkins, Janet Ingraham, and Bernadine Taylor, who spent countless days on the road as I went from home to home in this beautiful constituency. In particular, I will always be grateful for the summer spent with my granddaughter, Paige Christianson, who at 10 years of age spent most of her summer with walking sheets in hand, collecting data as we travelled the roads of Hants East. (Applause)</p>
<p>There are many more, Mr. Speaker. If I were to mention every volunteer, I am sure that you would quickly grow tired and impatient with this discourse. Please allow me the indulgence to mention one more, though. Mark Wallis dropped in to volunteer at the very first of the campaign. Mark was a godsend, and later in this speech you will know what I mean when I say an angel sent him to our door that day. Without Mark and his amazing abilities, the campaign would have been much different.</p>
<p>For all of this I am grateful, and even more so for all the voters who gave me a moment of their time so I could introduce myself, and for them to tell me their vision of Hants East. I'm grateful for each and every one who exercised their right to vote, and even more for those who believed in me enough to vote for me. I don't take their support lightly, and I will work diligently to address their concerns, for it is the people - the voters of this province - that we are accountable to. They gave us their trust and deserve no better than our very best efforts. I am humbled by their faith and support.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I continue with this Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, I am confident in the knowledge that this is where I am meant to be at this time in my life: in this House, on this day, working on behalf of the good people of Hants East. You see, I never dreamed of being a politician. I may have never really dreamed of farming either, but it was a great life for raising a family, and that is what I wanted. In the next three years, Robert and I had three children. Unlike the honourable Premier's parents, we decided three was enough.</p>
<p>Ours was a great life filled with challenge, hard work, good times, and the reward of seeing our children every day, with both of us being active in their lives. In 1999, after our youngest and only son, Bruce, decided to become a police officer, and with no children still interested in farming, we decided to sell our farm. Robert started another business, this time in the forestry sector, and I started a home-based business that fit into our lifestyle. Life was good, and as I approached my 50<sup>th</sup> birthday, I was serene in the belief that there would be no surprises. That was nine years ago.</p>
<p>On the night of my 50<sup>th</sup> birthday we received a call that every parent dreads, telling us to go to the Moncton Hospital, where our son had been taken after a vehicle crash in P.E.I. Mr. Speaker, you can only imagine the thoughts going through our heads on that drive. I was determined that nothing would hurt Bruce. He was 6'3" and bulletproof as far as I was concerned, but I was wrong, and just hours later I stood at Bruce's bedside, wiping the blood leaking from his eyes as he lay there, brain dead. It was then that we learned that a drunk driver caused the crash, and later we also learned that he was doing 178 kilometres an hour and had a blood alcohol of 0.243 - three times the legal limit.</p>
<p>It was a moment that changed my life forever. I needed to fight back; I couldn't change the past, but I could change the future. When I heard about the impaired driving statistics, I asked the question: Who does something about this? Three years later I became the person who does something about it as I took on the role as the National President for MADD Canada. (Applause) By sharing Bruce's story, laws were changed across Canada and lives were saved. He was still making a difference, albeit through me.</p>
<p>In 2010 my term ended, but not my resolve. I felt I still had more to do, so I wrote a book called <i>The Gift</i>, telling Bruce's story to the world and sharing the stories of 10 other families across Canada. Bruce lives on those pages.</p>
<p>Being involved with MADD Canada got me involved with politics at every level and I met many politicians, most wanting to do the best for the people they represent. I met many honourable men and women and paid attention to local and provincial politics like never before. Time passed and the face of politics had changed in Nova Scotia and I found like many others have, that I didn't approve of what was going on in our government. So, Mr. Speaker, with one door closed, an angel opened a window. I stand before you and all my honourable colleagues knowing that this is to be my path, that things happen for a reason. For whatever the reason, it is our duty to make this province a better place for this generation and future generations.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that at this time in our history and in this province we have the ability to improve life for all Nova Scotians and I look forward to working with all MLAs, on both sides of the House, to make this change. I believe in our government and I believe in the citizens of Nova Scotia, but even more I believe that all things are possible when there is a will for change. Thank you for this opportunity to address you in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly today. (Applause)</p></speech>
