      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please. Before we start the daily routine today, I would like to make a Speaker's Ruling on a point of privilege raised by the honourable member for Halifax Atlantic on April 2, 2013.</p>
<p><b>SPEAKER'S RULING: </b>House of Assembly Act (Section 33) - significance (Pt. of privilege by Ms. Michele Raymond [Hansard p. 240, 04/03/13]) No <i>prima facie</i> point of privilege. The member has other recourse.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 2, 2013, the member for Halifax Atlantic raised a point of privilege respecting the significance of Section 33 of the House of Assembly Act, which provides in part that the "House is a court of record, and has all the rights and privileges of a court of record for the purpose of summarily inquiring into and punishing the acts, matters and things herein declared to be violations of [the] Act."</p>
<p>I will not repeat all the details of her point of privilege. They are set out in full in Hansard of the day. The member described several past instances in which she believed that her privileges were breached; however, she stated that they were appropriately disposed of and that she was not requesting a re-examination of those matters. The member has not raised any unsolved instances.</p>
<p>The process with respect to question of privilege is clearly established. A question of privilege arises out of an event, the alleged facts of which must ultimately be adjudicated and a determination made as to whether the facts as found result in the infringement of a member's or the House's privileges or the commission of a contempt against the House. A question of privilege is not answered in abstract. A finding of a <i>prima facie</i> question of privilege results in the question being given precedence over other House business. An abstract or hypothetical question should not take precedence over other House business. In <i>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</i>: <i>Second Edition</i>, <i>Maingot</i> states that there "must be some act that improperly interferes with the Member's rights."</p>
<p>An additional difficulty with an abstract or hypothetical question is the requirement that a member should "demonstrate that the matter is being brought to the House's attention at the first opportunity" as provided by <i>O'Brien</i> and <i>Bosc</i> in the <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice: Second Edition</i>, at Page 144. This would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, with an abstract or hypothetical question. The member for Halifax Atlantic has not demonstrated that she has met this requirement.</p>
<p>Although the member has raised a number of questions that may, indeed, be important, that the member may consider pressing, and that the House may ultimately choose to deal with, the member has not alleged any facts that I may consider as to whether to give rise to a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege.</p>
<p>The member states in her submission that she is "gravely concerned that [her] service as a member may expose [her] to the possibility of inadvertently committing offences under the [House of Assembly] Act &#x2026;" Her concern is hypothetical. Without a specific allegation of a possible breach of privilege, there is nothing for me to consider and respond to. Therefore, I find that there is no <i>prima facie</i> point of privilege.</p>
<p>The member for Halifax Atlantic has other recourse with respect to the questions she has raised. She is free to put her proposed resolution before the House by giving a notice of motion in the usual fashion.</p>
<p>That is the ruling on this matter. Thank you.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Halifax Atlantic.</p></speech>

        <from>MS. MICHELE RAYMOND</from>
        <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for that ruling and I am very grateful for the determination of this. I would imagine that there will be future points of privilege raised by future members of this House, based on this, and I sincerely hope that the House will, in fact, constitute itself and accord you the authority to deal with it. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Thank you. I'd like to thank the honourable member for Halifax Atlantic for her concern.</p>
<p>Before we start the daily routine, the order of business, the subject matter for late debate has been chosen:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that all members of this House condemn the member representing New Glasgow for sitting at the Cabinet Table and not doing anything to help spur on the economy while the town has lost almost 6,000 jobs and seen its GDP shrink by 16 per cent since 2009.</p>

<p>Whereas for many years, the Department of Natural Resources has had helicopters which are intended to be used for department business like firefighting, fire prevention and wildlife surveys but are also brought in for medical evacuations, ground search and rescue and government personnel transport when necessary; and</p>
<p>Whereas unlike the NDP Government, who has made it its policy to use these helicopters as they are intended, the previous Liberal Government used them as political taxis, with 44 trips made by Liberal MLAs and Cabinet Ministers in just 15 months; and</p>
<p>Whereas 19 of those trips were made by MLAs who are still in this House - between May 1998 and July 1999, the member for Preston flew four times, the member for Clare flew five times, the member for Cape Breton South flew twice and the member for Richmond flew a whopping eight times - curiously, many of those trips were from Halifax to his constituency;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Liberal members representing these constituencies explain to Nova Scotians why they felt it was right to use the DNR helicopter as a political taxi when they were last in power.</p>

STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, former residents of the Home for Colored Children are saying that the Premier's panel is the wrong approach and will divide their community. Members of Ujamaa have reiterated this in their statement on April 5<sup>th</sup>, saying, "the panel suggested by the government will revictimize the victims and will not provide transparency and clarity to the African-Nova Scotian community."</p>
<p>My question is, why is the Premier insisting on proceeding with a process that will re-victimize the victims of abuse?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Well, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the process that we are seeking to follow is exactly the one that was recommended not only by the VOICES group, but by other African Nova Scotian groups. We're doing so, of course, to promote reconciliation and healing, and to ensure that there is a full examination. We want all of this to take place compassionately, understanding that there is, at the same time, a legal process underway that is dealing with the question of compensation.</p>

MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this government has heard from former residents, from Ujamaa and from restorative justice experts, that an independent panel is not what will help the victims heal. Instead, they have said this panel will do nothing but divide the community and continue the hurt.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is why would the Premier commit to a process that will divide a community rather than support its healing?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>That is not true. I'm going to now file with you and table a letter that is dated March 7, 2013, which we received from the VOICES group. In it, it says - and I can't read it all, because there's a lot in it - but it says:</p>
<blockquote>"Thank you for your letter of earlier this week. I am very appreciative of your government's expressed willingness to engage in a restorative process, to bring long overdue healing to the abuse victims of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children &#x2026; If we are able to settle the civil claims &#x2026;" - and as I've said, Mr. Speaker, that it is a separate matter of compensation - "&#x2026; we do not &#x2026;" - and I want to stress this - "&#x2026; we do not &#x2026;" (Interruptions)</blockquote></speech>

<blockquote>"&#x2026; we do not propose a public inquiry per say &#x2026; Rather than 'finger-pointing', a restorative approach to justice seeks to understand the context and causes of harm. The designer will help us identify who was involved or affected and who else can affect the outcome and will bring them into the process."</blockquote>
<p>And then further on, it goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>"We will be committed to an approach that promotes inclusion and participation among various stake-holders. These will include former staff, social workers/policy makers, members of the African-Nova Scotian community, et cetera." </blockquote>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the process that we have committed to. We are pleased today to have announced that Robert Wright, a well-known African Nova Scotian social worker with extensive experience, will be called upon to put together the terms of reference. We genuinely believe and hope that this will adequately and completely address the situation. (Applause)</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the important part of that letter is called restorative justice, and the victims, the abused at the Home for Colored Children have been denied justice. The Premier knows that the panel put together by his government does not allow the voices of those victims to be heard and it does not have the legal requirement to force people to testify at a public inquiry to ensure that Nova Scotians know exactly what happened at that Home for Colored Children, and that the victims finally get their voices heard and get served justice in the Province of Nova Scotia, where it has been denied for decades. (Applause)</p>
<p>I want to ask the Premier again, why would the Premier commit to a process that will divide a community rather than begin the healing?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition shows an extraordinarily poor understanding of the manner in which the Public Inquiries Act works, in the manner in which restorative justice works, in the way that reconciliation and healing takes place. In fact, he is right only about this - it does not start by trying to divide communities.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in that letter, we did exactly the opposite from that. We brought together broad-based groups among the African Nova Scotia community to try to reach a consensus on the kind of process that would actually bring about reconciliation and healing. That is what our government is dedicated to, and it is one that I believe the people of Nova Scotia are committed to. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. We cannot afford to repeat what happened in the Shelburne case. We must learn from the past if we are truly to have a restorative process.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, after many calls from both Opposition Parties and the former residents of the Home for Colored Children, the Premier actually had us believing that he may finally be taking those calls seriously about calling a full public inquiry. But then he sent his legal team in and had them quash the very stories in court that the residents were wanting to tell. Now we see that Tony Smith, the spokesperson for VOICES, has told reporters that they feel misled by what the Premier has said about his intentions around a public inquiry and I will table for the benefit of the Premier Mr. Smith's comments.</p>
<p>The Premier just tabled a letter in this House which he had previously said shows that they want a panel and not an inquiry, but that's not what that letter says. I will ask the Premier, why not do the right thing and call a full public inquiry so that Nova Scotians can get on with putting this horrible chapter behind us and allow the residents to have the closure they deserve?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the letter, I think, is pretty clear. It says, "&#x2026; we do not propose a public inquiry per say [sic]." That is an exact quote from what it says. That is exactly what it means, it means that we look to terms of reference. In fact, the terms of reference have not even been set yet.</p>
<p>What we have done is we have selected an individual who is well respected in the African Nova Scotian community, who has the skill set to put together an appropriate terms of reference. The terms of reference looks at the context, looks at the history, looks at the proper forum for giving people the ability to have their voices heard. That's exactly what the terms of reference do.</p>
<p>In this caucus, we have a deep affection for the questions associated with social justice. We have committed ourselves to them for most of our lives and we do so in this regard as well.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, no wonder VOICES and the former residents have lost faith in the way this government has handled their cause. Saying they don't " &#x2026; propose a public inquiry per say [sic]." is not the same as the way the Premier characterizes which is that they were calling for some panel. That's not the same thing at all. To try to comfort them today by saying that the terms of reference for the panel will satisfy them when those terms of reference are not even written. In fact, I'll table the Premier's own release that says they have appointed someone to write them, it shows the kind of games that are being played on such an important issue.</p>
<p>Will the Premier stop playing these kinds of games and get on with the job of simply calling a public inquiry that will satisfy not only residents but all Nova Scotians that they have a government that will do the right thing?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I really think this is a shame that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party would stoop to this kind of a response because, of course, that is the ultimate in playing games. You try to dismiss what it is - the work that has already been done, the consultations that have already taken place - and you suggest that there is an alternative process that somehow would be better.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the first thing that an inquiry of any nature would do, of course, is set its terms of reference. That is exactly what would have to happen in any case. It is fundamental to the work, whether it is a panel, an inquiry, you can name it what you like - it is the work that gets done that is the important thing and that is what actually yields up the result.</p>
<p>For example, the Leader of the Official Opposition does not understand that although you might be able to subpoena people, you can't actually make them testify. All of those kinds of things are, of course, very important considerations.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Okay, Mr. Speaker, so let's call it what we want - let's call a full public inquiry. That has a definition in the Public Inquiries Act. It is what the residents are asking for. It is what Nova Scotians know leads to ultimate justice and the ability for the province to move on. Let's not call it something different, let's call a full public inquiry. As the Premier says, let's call it what it is, let's call what's needed. Then truly, the residents will know that they don't have a government that is playing games; that they don't have to go through some alternative process that doesn't satisfy their needs, so that years from now we are no further ahead.</p>
<p>The Premier has a chance to do the right thing, to stop the shell game that's going on, so I'll ask him - if he truly believes that we should call it what it is, will he call a public inquiry?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm sure the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party thinks he knows better than all of the people we have consulted with and all of the individuals who we have talked to about this issue.</p>
<p>As I said, we talked to the members from the VOICES group, they were in my office. They followed up with the letter which I have just read to you. During those conversations they were very animated about the need, the desire to get to the question of their experience, what happened while they were in the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children.</p>
<p>We said, and we are committed to a vehicle for that expression, one that not only provides them with the opportunity to tell their story but one to look at the historical context in which it occurred, to look at the actions of governments of the day, which of course were Liberal and Progressive Conservative Governments, to look very specifically at what the societal norms of the day were so that we can try to understand the experience that we had.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is an attempt to ensure the most transparent and complete examination of the issue.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, today residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children had a press conference to share information about this government's active attempts to silence victims of abuse. While victims have called for a full public inquiry and restorative justice, instead this Premier has called for a think-tank to conduct an independent panel to develop terms of reference for this panel.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is, will the Premier tell the members of this House who sits on his independent think-tank?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I have no idea what the Leader of the Official Opposition is talking about but I don't think I'm alone in that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, all of the work was conducted through my office with the co-operation of the appropriate ministers including the Minister of Justice; the Minister of Community Services; the member for Halifax Needham, who is the Minister of Finance, of course, but was the Minister of Health and Wellness; the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. We brought together the resources of the government to hear from a broad-based group of people. They came from many different organizations, including the faith community, including groups of interested citizens. Yes, some of them had past experience in public life and of course they would.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in every answer that this Premier has given he never once mentioned the victims of this abuse - not once has he mentioned the victims. Let me tell you, in my first question today I quoted from a letter that he would have received from Ujamaa that is supporting the VOICES organization. It said Ujamaa Black family members held a meeting on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> to support VOICES organizations and their demand for a public inquiry. The panel suggested by the government will re-victimize the victims and will not provide transparency, clarity to the African Nova Scotia community.</p>
<p>Ujamaa represents African Nova Scotians from one end of this province to the other. My question is - outside a former NDP candidate, a former NDP MLA, do not speak on behalf of the residents. I want to remind the House that that letter was signed by Rocky Jones, whom I know the Premier knows. Finally, will the Premier admit that he appointed a group of individuals to actively silence former residents?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition's assertions, besides being demeaning and insulting, are also untrue. They are, in fact, the furthest thing from the truth. In fact, the VOICES group, when we met with them said that we were the first government to ever take them seriously and meet with them - that is what they told us when they met with us. I can only say this, there is nothing that hasn't been completely transparent in what we have done. At every turn we have tried to accommodate the desires of the VOICES group.</p>
<p>And he says we didn't mention the victims - we have talked about nothing else but the victims and trying to ensure that they have the pathway to restoration and healing. That, Mr. Speaker, is exactly what we have done.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6622244d-59c2-401f-9ce8-94ac1813c111"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what's insulting and demeaning - the fact that the Premier is ignoring the victims of abuse, that's what's insulting. Members from the African Nova Scotia community, VOICES people, victims have asked this government for a full, open, public inquiry. What they've received from this government has been stonewalling at every attempt to even last week when they sent their team of lawyers down to the courthouse to squash affidavits from victims of abuse.</p>
<p>What else are they to think when their own government is trying to have their voices squashed in a court - will the Premier do the right thing and call a full, open, public inquiry?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what he's suggesting would not adequately, in fact, address the issues and what we have done. In fact, I met with every person who had requested to speak or meet with me on this issue. I have made myself available, whether they are victims, whether they are represented by the VOICES group, whether they are represented by other groups, it didn't matter to me. What I wanted to understand was what the best route, best path forward is. I spent years in the courts, I know very well how adversarial those proceedings are. I understand very well that it is not a very perfect system and it is certainly not the kind of system that leads to the kind of result that we want.</p>
<p>I have been told over and over again by the VOICES group that this is not about money, they said we're not worried about that, so I take that at face value and I say the question of compensation, the question of the lawsuit is over here, the question of reconciliation, of healing, of understanding the circumstances and the pain of the victims, that is what we are engaged in here.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e4251ba6-058b-4a0c-a594-5aa62b14e7b7"><from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the NDP track record for election financing is abysmal. During the 2009 election campaign, the NDP took illegal donations from unions that totalled $45,000. When they were discovered, the NDP promised to return the illegal donations, but misled the public and failed to do so. The offence was so egregious and serious in nature that Elections Nova Scotia levelled its first-ever fine of such a nature to the Premier and his NDP, with the largest fine possible under the law.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it is widely speculated that an election is imminent, within the next few months. My question to the Premier is, will he commit to all Nova Scotians today that he will govern himself within the bounds of the law during this upcoming election, not conduct any illegal acts, as his Party did in 2009 (Interruptions) - I don't know what they're laughing at, this is fact and I'll table the documents - and can he table documents with the Clerk of the House that prove the donations were finally returned and that the NDP paid the maximum fine levied under the Elections Act?</p></speech>

When imposing their maximum fine under the Act, Elections Nova Scotia stated the contraventions were serious and not simply technical contraventions. They involved a significant amount of money. The acts were so serious that the matter was then referred to the police immediately after the NDP were fined. Recently Elections Nova Scotia - they're not laughing now over there, are they, Mr. Speaker? (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Recently Elections Nova Scotia identified a loophole that would allow the NDP to inappropriately finance their election campaigns in this province, Mr. Speaker. Nova Scotians expect that unions and corporations will no longer be allowed to provide financial benefits to political Parties - and that includes providing election loan guarantees.</p>

          <heading>PREM. - MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR FAMILIES: PLEDGE OUTCOME</heading>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Today a new report entitled <i>Can Nova Scotians Afford to Eat Healthy?</i> was released. It's a food costing report for 2012 produced by FoodARC, which concludes that over the last four years families in Nova Scotia are having more and more trouble feeding their own families nutritious food because of the cost - and I will share that with the House and with the Premier, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>There will be more trouble providing nutritious meals to their families, at the same time we've had four years of no real wage growth, four years of growing unemployment, four years of the highest taxes in the country, and skyrocketing power rates. Families deserve much better than that, so I will ask the Premier to explain why his pledge to make life better for today's families has gone so horribly wrong.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>The Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party should read the report. It actually commends our government that have increased income assistance rates. We increased minimum wage to the point where it is now among the highest, if not the highest in the country, and it's hard to believe that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party attacked the increase in the minimum wage, the very thing that puts food on the table for poor Nova Scotia families.</p>
<p>We're very proud of our record with respect to the support of the working poor and of those on income assistance; we're the ones who are returning the income tax to poor seniors who are on the GIS - these are initiatives that the Progressive Conservative Government had 10 years to do and never did.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>I just want to point out that there is absolutely no accuracy to the idea that I attacked the minimum wage - and I wish on such a serious question we'd get a serious answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the report shows that 23,561 people in Nova Scotia visited a food bank in the month of March 2012 alone - that's a 5 per cent increase over the same month in 2011, and the number of visitors to our food banks have gone up an astounding 40 per cent since 2008. Those are facts; those are real numbers.</p>
<p>Of course that 40 per cent number should sound familiar because that is in fact as well the amount that power rates have gone up, a price that all Nova Scotians have to pay - and I'll table both of those facts from Statistics Canada for the benefit of the Premier.</p>
<p>Since no one asked Nova Scotians, particularly our most vulnerable, if they wanted to pay the highest taxes or the highest power rates in Canada when they were voting in the last election, I will ask the Premier to explain, why is he forcing those very families to pay so much more now and have less to provide a nutritious meal to their own children?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the suggestion made by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is outrageous for the following reasons. First of all we inherited the Nova Scotia Power regime from the Progressive Conservative Government and the reason why power rates went is because they tied us to fossil fuel rates year after year after year. Secondly, with respect to the question of taxation we actually created the Affordable Tax Credit, the Poverty Reduction Tax Credit which actually takes some of that tax increase, in fact much more of it than they would have paid in tax and puts it into the pockets of those people who are the worst off, meaning that they have more money to buy the things that they need for them and their families.</p>
<p>&#xFFFD;In addition, Mr. Speaker, we invested almost $130 million in poverty reduction initiatives to deal with exactly those communities. Everything from increases in IA to increases in the per diems paid to foster parents. That is the record of this government.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#39fe31af-4449-4a39-bd02-eac2eb6643e5"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's sad to see that the Premier seems to be telling our families here in Nova Scotia who are struggling to get by that the NDP answer is that they should go under income assistance under his government, but that is not a good enough answer. The report shows that a family of four trying to eat healthy in 2012 - that cost 26 per cent more than it did five short years ago. In some areas of Nova Scotia like Cape Breton, like Guysborough, Cumberland County it cost even more than that. Perhaps that's why in our rural areas the 10,300 people have moved away in the last four years - and I'll table that - and 6,200 have lost their full-time jobs.</p>
<p>Those are the issues that the Premier wants to focus on, creating real opportunity, with real wages and real growth. Instead he has made life much more expensive for our most vulnerable citizens. I will ask the Premier, why does he insist on making them pay more for HST, more for their power, when it is causing so much hardship?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we changed the system in order to put more money in the pockets of exactly those people. In fact, as I said, the Affordable Living Tax Credit, the Poverty Reduction Credit puts more money in their pocket. We invested in job growth; we invested in ensuring that there was a minimum wage that was enough to support people; we have supported young people graduating from university, with a Graduate Retention Rebate. Right across the board, where people have found themselves without the financial security they need, they have found the support of this government.</p>

<p>Let's review the history, Mr. Speaker. In 1999, under the leadership of a Liberal Government the wait time for orthopaedic surgery was six months; today, if you are lucky, it's about 14 months. The wait time for general surgery in 1999, a little over one month; today it's about seven months. Eight years ago, the wait time for an MRI was a little over two months; today, on the average, it is about seven months. I had a constituent, Mr. Brian Nelson, in my office this week telling my assistant he's waited 17 months.</p>
<p>Could the Minister of Health and Wellness tell us why this NDP Government has disappointed Nova Scotians time and time again, when it comes to addressing health care wait times?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#331409ea-d1b7-4360-84de-bcaf1d09e73d"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all, the question that the member brings forward is really meaningless because we did not have accurate information around wait times. That didn't come in across the country until about the mid-2000s to truly reflect what is going on and what's happening across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>We have worked hard over the last three, almost four years, to improve health care delivery here in Nova Scotia. We inherited a financial mess from the former government, along with that was a health care system that was unsustainable. We've made positive changes within the health care system over the last four years so that it will be sustainable into the future and I look forward to working extremely hard as we improve the system in the coming years.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#ea522cb5-76c2-4f6d-920c-5b1835704b1a"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians not only deserve a better response than that, they deserve better from the NDP Government when it comes to addressing wait times. After all, $34 million in federal funding specifically for wait time reduction and how does government spend the money? They put it into general revenue to help balance the books. To add insult to injury this NDP Government during its mandate has spent close to $1 million advertising their Better Care Sooner plan - well, how ironic.</p>
<p>Will the minister admit to the thousands of Nova Scotians languishing on wait times that his NDP Government has failed them?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. WILSON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what the member should do is apologize to Nova Scotians for the chaos that the Liberals left the health care system when they were last in government; we're still feeling the effects today. He mentions $34 million of federal transfers coming into the province, we appreciate the minimal support that we do get from the federal government, we spend $3.9 billion in health care, we spend that to ensure that people have access to the health care services that they need, unlike when the last round of Ministers of Health from the Liberal Government flew around firing nurses, closing hospital beds. We're working with district health authorities to ensure that they have the services Nova Scotians need.</p>

The report takes into consideration the rising cost of power, transportation, taxes and food.

And I will table that information.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we increased the IA rates, we took the HST and we actually put it in a fund and took that money and gave it to those exact people through the Affordable Living Tax Credit, through the Poverty Reduction Credit. This government put money into the hands of the poorest people in Nova Scotia, and we did it in ways that no government has ever done it before.</p></speech>

Today's report shows that health food is unaffordable to families. Given these statistics, it's unconscionable for the government to allow power rates to skyrocket, keep taxes so high, and let unemployment continue to climb.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the NDP need to stop making people choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier reverse his expensive policies and create the economic conditions Nova Scotians need to prosper?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what is unconscionable is that you had a government that was receiving $450 million a year in offshore royalties, who spent more than $1 billion over and above expanding budgets and didn't do a thing to address poverty - did not do a thing to address those people who are most vulnerable in our society. That is the record of the Progressive Conservative Government.</p>
<p>This government brought in the Poverty Reduction Credit, brought in the Affordable Living Tax Credit, increased income assistance, increased the per diems paid to foster parents, and increased the Child Tax Benefit. We are the ones who took the HST off home electricity, put in place an efficiency program to provide better efficiencies for the homes that those poor people actually live in to reduce the cost of their electricity budgets. That is what this government is doing.</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Spring lobster season is underway in Nova Scotia and once again we see fishermen being faced with rock bottom prices for lobster. Everyone in this House knows just how important the lobster fishery is to the economies of rural Nova Scotia and to the economy of our entire province. As we speak, fishermen in Guysborough, Antigonish and Pictou Counties are tying up their boats in protest over low lobster prices.</p>
<p>My question is, is the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture concerned by the low prices for lobster for Nova Scotia fishermen or better yet, does he have any plans to address low lobster prices in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, I know, certainly, I am deeply concerned. That is why we have met, consistently, with our federal counterpart, Mr. Ashfield, and the Atlantic Ministers of Fisheries. I can tell you that we also have made a presentation to Ottawa in early February. I suggest the members opposite on both Parties get that presentation. I would love to have the opportunity to talk about diversifying the fisheries and creating more jobs in the rural communities. This is something that's very important to us. We have invested in the Lobster Council of Canada and we are monitoring this and working with the industry and I thank the member for bringing this question forward.</p>

We all know that anything under $5 is basically such that fishermen cannot make ends meet. As I said earlier, we know the important role this plays in the economy of rural Nova Scotia and in the economy of the province. Anytime that lobster prices are low, it not only affects the fishermen it affects the growth of our province and the revenues of our province.</p>
<p>Again, I ask the Minisser of Fisheries, what plan does he have in place to address the low price of lobster in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

We are also working with the industry on the certification of the MSC. We also took our presentation to Ottawa and one thing we talked about there is making sure that the lobster industry does not include quotas which I can point out that the federal government and the Third Party, the PCs, are suggesting introducing.</p>
<p>The very first thing that I did as minister of this portfolio was take the vendor's fee for licenses for roadside sales. That's the very first thing that I did in this mandate. We have stood up to Ottawa when it comes to the owner-operator and fleet separation policy - again something the federal Party and the PCs have introduced and want to dismantle the independent inshore fisheries.</p>
<p>We have done a lot for this industry, we understand the struggle that's going on with the low prices and we look forward to working with the industry. Thank you.</p></speech>

In fact, in a letter that was written just yesterday, the Board Regulatory Affairs Officer, Doreen Friis had this to say, "The board has not received any request from board counsel for an extension or any indication that the consultants retained by board counsel have not had sufficient time to review the information related to their scope of work."

On November 7, 2006, the member for Queens spoke at length about the importance of competition against Nova Scotia Power in the renewable sector - quite a long time in this Legislature and in favour of the very proposals the NDP now attack.</p>
<p>I'll quote part of that. She spoke for quite a long time so I don't have time to quote the entire thing; "We are doing a disservice to our children and our grandchildren not to act now, not to hold Nova Scotia Power accountable not just for rate increases yearly, but to hold them accountable to truly move forward to open up the market, and allow true competition." I will table that, of course, and I suggest he read the rest of her remarks.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, why is the NDP so hostile to that idea now?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, of course as the honourable member would know, we have the COMFIT program in this province that is opening up competition to all kinds of community groups and CEDIFs and universities and non-profit groups and it's working across this province. We have dozens of applications and I think at the last count we had 60-some approvals for COMFIT projects. This could be for small wind, they could be for large wind, they could be for tidal, or they could be sustainable biomass or farm biomass. There are all kinds of possibilities that we're blessed with here in Nova Scotia so we are truly fortunate to have many competitive uses for energy here within Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, she was not the only NDP member. On November 1, 2006, the member for Cape Breton Centre, now the Deputy Premier, asked the former Progressive Conservative Government when they would implement regulations to allow renewable energy providers to sell directly to customers, and I will table that. At the same time the member for Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage was voting in favour of a motion at HRM supporting the exact same thing. That's three of them just off the top.</p>
<p>Now the Progressive Conservatives refused to do it then when the NDP wanted, now the NDP are joining the Progressive Conservatives and throwing rural Nova Scotia, HRM, and renewable energy producers all under the same bus. Mr. Speaker, does the minister believe the Deputy Premier was wrong when he demanded the Progressive Conservative Government introduce competition?</p></speech>

            <p>I'll come back to the COMFIT program for being praised as being one of the best in the world for diversifying our energy mix, for using the natural resources that we're blessed with here in Nova Scotia. I'm still trying to figure out the Liberal energy plan. I know some days they talk about putting the HST back on, some days they want to take it off. They want to eliminate Efficiency Nova Scotia. They're going to deregulate electricity, that's a 30 to 50 per cent increase. We know the model in New Brunswick is not working. They want to cosy up to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec. Just where do the Liberals stand on diversifying our energy policy?</p>

Yesterday as the government members well know - maybe the Minister of Energy should start showing up for briefings because of course what New Brunswick did yesterday was not at all take out renewable, in fact they said that was one of the things that is working and they've kept that in the bill in the legislation they introduced yesterday, sorry to disappoint. But if he wants to talk about deregulation well, in fact, there is actually only one Party in this House that's ever spoken in favour of deregulation and it's the NDP.</p>
<p>On December 4<sup>th</sup> (Interruption) - maybe the Minister of Communities, Culture, and Heritage should listen for a change. The member for Queens, standing up, praised the Ontario energy model saying we need to look to Ontario, a province that is moving aggressively; the expertise is there, we just need to move forward - and I've already tabled that. Will the minister confirm that, in fact, the NDP is the only Party in this Legislature to speak in favour, on the record, of deregulation, that what they are doing is everything they can to strengthen Nova Scotia Power in advance of their move to deregulation?</p></speech>

            <p>The only Party that has been promoting deregulation has been the Liberal Party in this country. That plan has not worked in Ontario, it has not worked in Alberta, it has not worked in British Columbia, it has not worked in California, it has not worked in Maryland, it has not worked in New Brunswick, so why is the Liberal Party continuing to promote a plan that has failed, that is a recipe for chaos in this province? We as a government are going to work on a renewable electricity plan that is green, efficient, tax-free, and the lowest, fairest rates for Nova Scotians.</p>

Has the minister talked to the mill about looking at ways to reduce regulations that may be hurting profits in the trucking industry?

          <speech by="#0592f881-721c-495f-a273-d237278fabfc"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to join in this debate this afternoon as submitted by the honourable member for Victoria-The Lakes.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, New Glasgow is a small town of about 9,500 people. It's probably about the same population as the Town of North Sydney used to have or the Town of Sydney Mines used to have that I represent, but their economy supports the sprawling area from Pictou, Truro, all the way to Antigonish and even into Guysborough County. The people of the town have an avenue to create real change, change for their community.</p>
<p>One of their MLAs sits at the Cabinet Table, speaks with the Premier and other Cabinet Ministers on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and could have a real contribution to how the province is run. What better way for the people of that area to have their concerns brought to the government table than to have both sitting government members and sitting Cabinet members at the table?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, as we can see from some of the results, the member for Pictou Centre has failed his constituents while letting 6,000 jobs disappear from that small town. I mean we know that is not something that someone would intentionally plan, so what is the concern? We know that during the first contract debate last year, industries like Sobeys and Michelin brought concerns to all members of the Pictou County area. We were told that they did not bring those concerns to the government or bring the concerns forward.</p>
<p>We also heard last week and in this House from all Party members that in order to buck the 7.2 year trend for an MLA, they have to look after their constituents. That means bringing their concerns forward, bringing their concerns so that the people have a voice in this government from the area they represent.</p>
<p>It seems to us, Madam Speaker, like this didn't happen. If the businesses had brought their concerns to the MLAs, and the government says they didn't hear those concerns from the Pictou County industries, then we can only assume that they weren't brought forward.</p>
<p>After four years in office, the excuses we're hearing are running thin - $1.6 billion to the provincial debt; an increase to the HST of 2 per cent, which raised another $1 billion in tax revenue. We're hearing about the windfall that the offshore revenue brought in for the government years ago, I think it's around the same amount of money that this government has brought in, in tax raises.</p>
<p>We heard of a $27 million error in the budget and an error that it was told doesn't really mean that much but, Madam Speaker, the people who are losing their jobs and having to move out of an area, $27 million seems like a ton of money. That seems like it's the legacy of this government, telling Nova Scotians one thing and doing just the opposite.</p>
<p>There are large companies that employ large numbers of Nova Scotians in that New Glasgow area, probably two of the largest employers in the province, but it seems to us like the NDP didn't listen when Michelin and Sobeys told them their job-killing legislation was wrong. It doesn't happen very often where we see members from the two largest companies in the province come to the Committee on Law Amendments and voice their concerns about a bill that has come forward in this House, but that's what we heard when Michelin and Sobeys came to the table here. These are companies who receive massive equity from the government.</p>
<p>There are companies there who sit with empty parking lots. We hear of a company there, DSTN, that received $60 million from the government to buy 49 per cent of their company. From all reports we hear, when people drive by, there are not a lot of cars in the parking lot. We've also heard over the last little while that the company now plans to diversify, use the government subsidies against businesses in their own province, businesses that don't get these government subsidies and businesses that have to spend their own money to compete. It doesn't seem fair that a business that's trying to make it on its own is going to compete with a large company subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>It seems like the NDP simply don't get it. We think four years of this is long enough. We have heard from the government, we've heard the Premier say, look what they've done in four years. They would say, what can we do with five more? I shudder to think that. Five more years of what we have here of higher taxes and higher power rates, higher fuel costs - I don't think the people of Nova Scotia are looking forward to that. But we'll find that out. We have a general election coming within the next year. We'll find out if that's what people want to hear.</p>
<p>The issue, simply, may be that the Premier isn't listening to the member. If he's ignoring employers like Michelin and Sobeys, it's obvious there's another agenda and doesn't care what's said by whom and to whom. Who are we standing up for? We know they're not standing up for the people of Pictou Centre who elected an NDP MLA. Then again, as I said, we will see what the people think during the next general election. If they think the job is being done, if they think the government's doing a good job, we'll be back with the same configuration in this House.</p>
<p>From what we are hearing across the province, from what we're hearing from residents of Nova Scotia, they're not happy with this. We're hearing the same thing from the people of Pictou County. We hear of a jobsHere plan and we hear from the Premier and the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism that the jobsHere plan is working. We also know that there are massive job losses in areas like Pictou County and Cape Breton. Cape Breton has an unemployment rate of over 18 per cent.</p>
<p>We, as Progressive Conservatives, believe, as former Premier G.I. Smith once said, that the purpose of the government is not to regiment and compel people into action, it's to free up the human spirit in all its forms to achieve the highest possible end. Make those conditions correct, proper so that businesses can thrive. Remove the red tape and make it easier for businesses to start up. Decrease the taxes to make it easier for businesses to make the decisions that they could either add to the company, add to the business or employ more people. Decrease the power rates, which are crippling a lot of small businesses in our province, and a lot of the big businesses. Decrease fuel rates and fuel costs so the people who have to get goods to market can get them there and compete with other provinces that don't have those costs.</p>
<p>As Progressive Conservatives we believe in balanced budgets, living within your means, smaller government, lower taxes, less debt and freeing up the entrepreneurial spirit that we know is out there so that every Nova Scotian and every Nova Scotia business can soar as high as their ability, ambition and creative drive can take them. A growing economy is the best way to pay for public services we all cherish like health care and education.</p>
<p>We know that the more people we put to work, the more people we get back in our province, the more money that gets spent here, the more they pay in income taxes, the more they pay in property taxes, money we can use in this province to improve our health care system and improve our education system.</p>
<p>As a Party we need to work with other towns, businesses and associations to create a better Nova Scotia. We need to work with small businesses and we need to work with the people who work in those businesses to make sure they stay and thrive in our province. As a government we need to do all of the above, and reach beyond what we have here today to create a better future for our children and our future generations. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#23484f25-d8f5-4e64-8e5f-4bd7e91f5410"><from>HON. ROSS LANDRY</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I do hope there are people in Pictou County watching.</p>
<p>I am hopefully going to just outline some of the favourable things that are happening in our riding, but I want to start off by very clearly stating that the member who just spoke and the member for Cape Breton West, their philosophy on energy is about burning coal and about burning more coal. I want to say to my riding that Progressive Conservative energy policy is more fly ash for Pictou County. So the people in the Hillside group, you want to clearly listen to that group, and clearly understand that they want to burn more coal in Pictou County. They want to pollute our houses, they want to pollute our community. So those who suffer from fly ash know exactly what I say. So I want to get that right out for that member there, and it's a concern for energy policy and a concern for people in Pictou County.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I ran, Madam Speaker, in Pictou County was because of the mismanagement of the Progressive Conservative Party and their budget. When you look at the decisions that they made in regard to the jail, and I'm going to come into this a little further, and how they politicized that and made decisions that benefited their political advantage rather than the economic needs of this province - so they've got nothing to stand on when they come into this House to speak.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, our government is talking about the long-term jobs and about a strategy. I'm going to just elaborate on the energy, because this is a key critical factor, and there's a distinct difference between the Progressive Conservative Party and us as a government. We want to have, with the Maritime Link, the ability for us to be a distributor and a transporter of energy, not the end receiver. Their philosophy is go to the coal mines of Cape Breton, dig up the coal and burn it.</p>
<p>And that member who just spoke had the audacity in this House to say that we can burn clean coal. Can you imagine? Somebody with an education today saying that you burn &#x2013; I'd like to see somewhere where there's energy where it says that there's clean coal that you can burn - and the cost that that would be to our people. So the people of Pictou in the Hillside group, the people of Trenton where I go, the people on the West side of New Glasgow, they've got high real estate - the Progressive Conservatives want to pollute your neighbourhood. I bike through there; I go running through there; I enjoy that neighbourhood; I grew up there. I want a clean neighbourhood, and I want to reduce the amount of carbon and coal that's there.</p>
<p>Also on the carbon issue that's there, Madam Speaker, is that we know in the global economy that if provinces or states or governments are investing in fuels that our ability to sell our products get restricted. The idea that we're taking a step backwards &#x2013; now I've got some prepared notes here, but I'm worked up, I'm passionate about my neighbourhood, and I'm committed to running in my neighbourhood and serving the people of Pictou County.</p>
<p>The Progressive Conservative ideology is, when I went to ask, can we get a new hospital for Pictou County? We've got an aging building there; no we've got to do upgrades. When I examined further, why do we need to do the upgrades? Because the person in my riding that I'm actually going to be running against was a minister in the Cabinet at the time, they overspent by $100 million into the Truro hospital. That money could have been used to build a brand new hospital in New Glasgow. So I want people out there to really listen to this question here today. And just think about it a minute, a nice modern hospital, but the Progressive Conservatives mismanaged. So when they come into this House here, into this House and say they're about managing dollars and helping business, they're the furthest from the truth - because they did unallocated spending and mismanagement of our money.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there are a number of companies in our area that bring good jobs to Nova Scotia. Over $13 million in the provincial coffers that we would be able to save in jobs like PROJEX, IBM, which the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party stood in this House and criticized the people from that company sitting up in our balcony here. And they not only criticized them bringing in good jobs here, that we could take over $13 million that we'll make in profit that we can spend in the hospitals and into our health care. They didn't do that. They want to be critical that way.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, I'm here today to say that I'm committed to jobs in our area. That we have, through the Productivity Investment Program, businesses of all sizes benefit from this. For example, there's a capital investment of over 10,000 people who will get jobs with training and improve their skills. We do know that in this market we have a lot of labour in Nova Scotia, that we have a lot of people here working. They need the skills, so you need to change the education system, the community college system, to allow them to get that opportunity. We want people to get that chance to get that education so we've invested heavily in there.</p>
<p>A number of companies have benefited from the PIP, from the innovative fund, Stark Oil International, in New Glasgow; MacGregor's Custom in my area, it would actually be in Pictou East area. The Velsoft company got business awards and benefits from this government.</p>
<p>We've invested in something - I want to just stress this to the people of Pictou County who might be seeing this. The Progressive Conservative Government said hey let's take the natural gas and sell it to the Americans and what we'll do is we'll go and dig more coal out of the ground and we'll burn it into the place and we'll say the heck with Pictou County, they're going to vote for us anyway. The Progressive Conservatives of Pictou County think that they have a divine right to govern in Pictou County. It's up to the voter.</p>
<p>It took this government to get natural gas in there. Could you imagine, Madam Speaker, could you imagine that if we had that natural gas when it was first going through - because it runs right by Pictou County, right by New Glasgow that they say that they're so concerned about. Why didn't they bring it in? We wanted it for the hospitals. The mayor and community leaders have been asking for it. He talked about Michelin and Sobeys. Michelin were talking about getting natural gas. This government had to put it in. We got it done. The Progressive Conservatives didn't get it done. That's for sure, and I want to stress that very clearly.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, another reason I ran was there were 5,000 people without a doctor in my riding when I came in - 5,000 people who needed doctors. There are only a few hundred there now that are going to get it, so there is improvement. We've got a collaborative health care system, we're making improvements. I had the opportunity the other day, I heard a number of criticisms about the hospital over the years but now I'm starting to hear positive things. We're making changes in there and making it more efficient, unlike the Progressive Conservative Government that was unable to do that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to continue as well - just about their management. When I got elected, the Town of Trenton councillor came to me and said Ross we need the $300,000 and some for our Main Street project, can you get that for us? We're already getting the work done and we need to make a payment on that. I want all listeners out there to know, I asked them to get me the paperwork on it. There was none. I came in and I checked into Cabinet documents. I came in and I checked in government documents. You know what they did? My predecessor made a promise that they would pay it but they didn't go to Cabinet and get authority. They didn't authorize to make that expenditure.</p>
<p>We know that that previous government there, the Progressive Conservatives, turned around and spent over a billion dollars on allocated funding. This government turned around and eliminated the year-end spending. I can say that my predecessor got a $45,000 tax-free payout - I don't know how you get a tax-free payout but anyways that happened. When we came into government one of the first things we did is we cut off that $45,000. I'd like to see him pay it back and talk about fiscal management and put that money into good health services in our area, let's just see if he'll do that. Let's see if the Progressive Conservative Leader will come up and stand up and say that that's injustice. We saw the rats leaving the ship back at the time when that money was coming out of there. They got out the door pretty quickly, I can tell you that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to talk about DSTN. My father worked in that plant from the time I was a young fellow, between that and Maritime Steel whenever they could get work. The Progressive Conservative idea was get the bulldozer out, clean it out of there but today what we have there is a modern building that's efficient. There are over 100-some workers working there, people I went to school with, people I know, but there is nowhere on the Nova Forge issue where the Progressive Conservatives come to bat. I didn't hear one thing from the Progressive Conservative Party saying let's go to the federal ACOA and get them on board to get some money to keep that forge going instead of letting that world class machinery go out the door. That's their idea.</p>
<p>The Progressive Conservatives did not support the jail in Pictou County. They wanted it to go to Springhill. They were against building it there. That jail is in there for the right reasons. One of the reasons that I ran is that that jail should have been there from the start and it's the most cost effective and efficient way to do that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you and I hope that there are people out there watching this because I know one of the reasons he asked the question today was to stir up that spark. I'm ready for the fight in Pictou County. I believe in Pictou County, I believe in the people in New Glasgow. Just so you know, the population there is 9,500 and they took 6,000 out of the town and I wonder how many children were laid off their jobs so they should get their facts straight and talk about the broader base of Pictou County. Once again I just want to reiterate, voting Progressive Conservative in my area is more fly ash for Pictou County, thank you.&#xFFFD;</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Glace Bay.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#d6776846-b12b-4366-882f-9844bee20011"><from>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>It gives me pleasure to rise on this late debate today. It's a very important topic, I think, and I don't want to go down the road with the inside politics of this discussion. I think there certainly is a larger discussion here when you look at the economy. I think every member here has their strengths and has the things that they believe in and certainly feel they can speak to.</p>
<p>This is an important debate and an important resolution because I think it highlights a problem that we have in this province. When you look at the numbers, Pictou County, 6,000 jobs and the GDP shrank by 16 per cent, that's certainly a problem and it's a testament that, whether it's New Glasgow and the 9,500 residents there or if it's the county, the greater county, the economy is in trouble.</p>
<p>I know that the members have seen this many times but I'm just going to quickly go through these - when you look at the numbers for unemployment, it's a problem. Again, I go back to my biggest complaint, I guess, or my biggest issue that I take with the government with respect to economic development, is their marketing strategy tells people that things are so good.</p>
<p>We had that advertising debate yesterday and I wouldn't make this up, this is the truth and I'm glad this is my opportunity to share this story. A friend of mine was watching Hockey Night in Canada a few months back and saw the jobsHere ad and called me up - he doesn't differentiate between Parties, he just knows I'm here in Halifax in the Legislature - and he said, oh, I saw that ad on jobsHere so where do I apply for these jobs? Where do I go? Where's the value?</p>
<p>Again, I'm not going to waste any of my 10 minutes on that but the point is, we're telling people how great the economy is. The economy is great in Halifax, at 6.7 per cent unemployment and that's fantastic and that's the way it should be and that's important but we are seeing the decay of the rural economies and of rural job growth.</p>
<p>When you look at those numbers, the staggering 18 per cent in Cape Breton, what we're seeing in the North Shore at 12.9 per cent, Annapolis 11.5 per cent, southern 13.2 per cent, and when you see those types of numbers and our GDP growth, the gross domestic product, which is based on the entire value of your economy, it grows or it shrinks and that obviously determines recession or a period of growth. It's 0.2 per cent growth in the province, which is staggering when you think - and the government talks about it, we all talk about this success of Halifax. When you look at the fact that we have a 0.2 per cent GDP growth provincially, Halifax is a heavy impact and a heavy reason why that is in positive. We are not in entire recession, as a province, because of Halifax.</p>
<p>When you think of the fact that there is 0.6 per cent unemployment, our whole growth was 0.2 GDP, we're in trouble in terms of the rural economies and we've got to address that and it's something that we have to take seriously and I don't believe that this government does. When you look at 6,000 jobs, 16 per cent shrink in GDP, a report from the Conference Board of Canada, it's astounding when you see a direct line item in a Conference Board of Canada, which I will table, saying New Glasgow's economy shrank every year since 2009 and the region has shed almost 6,000 jobs since 2008, very significant and that's the point. I think it's another example of what I disagree with, in terms of the government, and that is that the big cheques don't work. They don't work economically and I don't think, and maybe I'll be wrong, but I don't think they work politically either.</p>
<p>When you ignore the symptoms and the symptomatic problems of an economy, the answer is not one industry, the answer is not a big cheque, the answer is not well we've done - you know if you're in a situation where you're talking about economies and when the topic arises, you have one bullet for that answer, it's one, well this is what we did, well this is what we did, we invested in this company. That's not good enough, it's not about - I've said this many times in my place and I'll say it again, if we're counting on the government to steer the economy, then we are failing Nova Scotians, that's not our job.</p>
<p>Our job is to set the parameters within our controls, to make sure that that policy - like red tape, of course, policy like taxation, policy like power rates because they're the things that affect businesses, they're the things we control and that's what we have to look at. Again, I think that economically and politically the big cheques and the corporate welfare don't work.</p>
<p>The minister mentioned DSTN and that's one certainly that's near and dear to me because I've talked about it many times in here and I don't disagree that TrentonWorks, the predecessor to DSTN, had a great impact and the minister talked about his dad and family there. That's important and I'm not questioning any of that but what I see and what I saw and it was alarming the day that I saw it at the Economic Development Committee, I think it was only my second meeting as a member of that committee, that we have an organization in Pictou County that we've given $60 million to. That's a lot of money in itself but we are now 49 per cent owners of that, Madam Speaker, which is a concern.</p>
<p>Again, back to my previous points. We are directly involved in an industry if we own 49 per cent of a company, so that's troubling. When you look at the fact that that business plan was signed off by the government to produce wind turbines, so for $60 million we have a 49 per cent stake in a wind turbine operation which is now, as we are hearing, DSTN is abandoning that and they're moving predominantly to fittings and anything to service the oil and gas.</p>
<p>The global question I have and the concern that relates to all this about rural economies is the fact that we've given money to a company and that business plan has entirely evaporated, and now we're moving on to something else. So I think that, generally speaking, taxpayers should be concerned that we've invested in a business plan that by and large has not succeeded and now we're moving in a different direction. That is one problem. The other problem is now we will have head-to-head competition with public dollars.</p>
<p>How much time do I have, Madam Speaker?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Four minutes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#d6776846-b12b-4366-882f-9844bee20011"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Thank you. So we have DSTN - and I'll go very quickly - the minister and I had a very fair and I think reasonable exchange during estimates about Irving and the minister made all kinds of points about the value of Irving and the benefits of that contract. I don't disagree with any of that; we've never disagreed with any of that.</p>
<p>The problem is, if you see Hansard from estimates, you will see the minister respectfully did not have an answer for why this couldn't have been a loan instead of a grant. Irving would have been just as successful; the $300 million component from the Government of Nova Scotia would have been just as effective if this money had been paid back. We could have put a 10-year term with no interest and we could have eaten the interest for Irving if that was the plan, but it was a grant.</p>
<p>However, notwithstanding that, now we have DSTN who have $60 million tax dollars, who will now bid for contracts when the Irving shipyard ramps up, with public dollars. So we have $264 million in non-repayable to Irving and they will put out tenders for bids and DSTN - if they're moving in that oil and gas direction - will now be bidding when they have operations subsidized to the tune of 49 per cent staked by the province and $60 million tax dollars. So that is a problem, it's a symptomatic problem of what we've done, economic development-wise, and I think it's a concern.</p>
<p>I will wrap up by saying I think we all understand the state of the economy and the fact that rural economies are eroding. We have a shrinking GDP number, we have negative growth, which means we're now in a recession, basically, everywhere outside of Halifax. That's a concern and it doesn't matter who it is, the Government of Nova Scotia - the corporate welfare, the handouts, they don't work economically or politically. I hope they don't work politically and I think that has to become, if we learn any lessons in terms of economic development, it has to be entrepreneurs. We've got to support small businesses.</p>
<p>We can create incentives to grow businesses from five and six people to seven and eight people. We always forget a statistic that's so important - 98 per cent of our economy runs on small to medium enterprises, which means it's not the corporations that drive our economy. We've got to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Again, it's about making business easier. We all have entrepreneurs in our communities who complain about the little things. After they work their full work weeks and manage employees and do that, then it's the paperwork for Revenue Canada, for the province, for all these different whatever aspect of their businesses. It's a lot of work and it makes it to the point, especially in some of the trades that are in rural communities, they say, do you know what? It's not worth the effort. Rather than do this and fill out the paperwork, I'm just going to go and work 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. for somebody else and skip that - and that is the effect that shrinks the economy.</p>
<p>There are ways to grow the economy through entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are two things - they are smart, and they take on risk. That's what we want. Businesses are going to fail, that's the reality of the competitive environment, but we have to give them an opportunity - and let's make sure New Glasgow has a measured approach to growing their economy. Thank you.</p></speech>
