They are accompanied in the Legislature by Gillian Wood and Pat Rodee from Dalhousie University, and also my Executive Assistant, Laurel Hynes Jenkins, is with them.</p>

Madam Speaker, I believe that yesterday I had the opportunity to try to remind this government of an unfortunate decision that was made by the Department of Justice via the minister.</p>
<p>In an unfortunate attempt to try to save money, a decision was made to limit autopsies that will be carried out by the Chief Medical Examiner's Office on the weekend. I believe, based on the reaction from members of the government yesterday during my comments, I believe they as well share my thoughts that this was a poor decision, one that is bound to come back to haunt them. I dread any Nova Scotian family that will be told when they're trying to figure out exactly what caused death to their loved one that they'll have to wait until Monday because they don't fall into the specific criteria set out by the Minister of Justice as to what autopsies will now be performed on the weekend, in the hopes of saving the government a few dollars.</p>
<p>This has disaster written all over it. The government knows this, or they should know it now. I would hate to be in a situation of having to say I told you so, but I firmly believe that one of the 52 members of this House will be getting a phone call from a family to say I can't believe we are being told we need to wait until Monday because the government is looking to save a few dollars.</p>
<p>There is time to change this decision. It's one that I think was done with probably not proper reflection as to what the impact would be. It's a groaner decision to say the least, and one that I truly believe is in poor taste - and it's not reflective of what this government said they would do in providing a better deal for Nova Scotian families. This certainly isn't a way of doing it. We agree there needs to be a means of finding savings - this just wasn't the place to go to try to find it.</p>
<p>So I made those comments. I would hope that having had the opportunity to reflect on it last night, the Minister of Justice and his colleagues may be prepared to reverse that decision. If not, they do so not only at their own peril for the embarrassment that will be caused to them but, even worse, the embarrassment that will be caused by Nova Scotians to see that our province would put grieving families in that type of a situation, of being told to wait while they grapple with wondering what caused the death of a loved one.</p>
<p>With that, Madam Speaker, I look forward to this bill moving on into the legislative process and going to the Law Amendments Committee. Hopefully by that time the Minister of Justice and the government will have a chance to reverse the decisions made on limiting weekend autopsies here in Nova Scotia during this fiscal year. I appreciate the indulgence of yourself and the House for having made those brief comments on Bill No. 72. Merci.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#64079cb8-9198-4f19-818a-597f1468ed7d"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Merci beaucoup, Madame le Pr&#xE9;sident - I almost said "Monsieur" there. It's funny how we're so used to having a male sitting in that Chair that even all our documents seem to have "Mr. Speaker" put on it. Of course, it's great to see you in the Chair again this morning, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>Of course I'm speaking on the Timely Medical Certificates Act for a few moments. I know the member for Hants West will want to say a few words to this, as well, as he has been in the past, of course, a paramedic and has seen the direct consequence of the wait for medical certificates or death certificates being signed in the field.</p>
<p>As you know, Madam Speaker, currently of course only doctors and medical examiners can sign the medical death certificate. Reading through the bill we see that it will permit nurse practitioners to sign the medical death certificate in circumstances that will be laid out in regulation. Of course, we'll be waiting to see those regulations to see what else might be in there because it does give a broader sense of who might be able to do that.</p>
<p>Right now I know the government is talking about nurse practitioners being able to do that kind of work. But it does include other authorized persons, of course, like medical investigators when a nurse practitioner is not available or that qualified person directs the funeral director to obtain the certificate of death.</p>
<p>Now, it does create a bit of a problem and some of us have experienced it, where we've had either a loved one pass away at home, either by different kinds of ailments, whether heart attack or other, and we understand the time that it takes for this process to move on. In my personal experience, it happened a number of years ago with the death of my father-in-law. I remember having to sit there and wait a number of hours until a death certificate was signed, before that body could be moved by the funeral directors.</p>
<p>Of course the funeral directors can't move that body until that medical death certificate is signed and if you're in a rural or remote area, it does create a bit of a problem. I think that's why I think the member for Lunenburg did bring this one forward, for that uncertain time. I know in my particular case it was a couple of hours, but I have heard instances where it is much longer than that and I don't think that is necessary.</p>
<p>The certain circumstances are changed and intended for instances of expected death, of course, not sudden death. Additional training needed to be provided to determine the cause of death and form completion. Right now we find that with the bill, where we're looking for more detail is the issue of potential costs. Of course, we know that this probably won't be a cost-saving exercise, because you have to train more individuals to do this and have them available on an on-call basis to perform these certificates.</p>
<p>Early consultation, of course, indicates the support but I'm sure that more consultation will have to occur to determine the details for the regulation. Of course, from the research that we've done, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Ontario do this already.</p>
<p>The member for Richmond brought up sort of a side point to this whole issue which is, of course, the availability of the medical examiner to do autopsies on the weekend, so this further lengthens the time that loved ones are waiting for their loved ones to come back to their local funeral home to be ready for wakes and other family activities that are around the funeral, whether it's the funeral itself or the wake.</p>
<p>Through the grieving process, we all deserve to have time with that loved one in a timely manner and to be able to either bury - or rather, to continue to move on with that process. If you're unlucky enough to have that on a weekend, you're going to end up having to wait that much longer for it to happen. I do hope that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice will have the opportunity to look again at this process to see if it makes it more appropriate for families who have lost a loved one and do need to move on in their grieving process with this.</p>
<p>I see that the member for Hants West does want to speak to this one as well. I think I've said everything I really want to say. We, as a Party, believe in the changes that are being brought forward in this bill, and I know my colleague will be talking a little more to the issue of other authorized persons. I think the scope can be expanded just a little bit more to make it easier for families to obtain those death certificates so that they're able to move on with their grieving processes.</p>
<p>With that, I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak, and I know there are a number of other speakers on this one. I look forward to listening to their issues and ideas on this bill.</p></speech>

I think it's a good piece coming forward. Having been in the business some years back as a paramedic, I know that it can be difficult, especially in some circumstances. There are a variety of circumstances, I guess I should say.</p>
<p>One we used to run into on a regular basis was a terminal illness. We would be called out because sometimes families do not know what to do when their loved one reaches the end of their life. We would go out and pronounce them as being deceased, and then we would have to leave. It may be hours before something could happen by way of those remains being transported or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>When I first read this, my thought was what a great thing. It's good for nurse practitioners that they can do that. I'm not sure what circumstances exactly - would they go to the home? Is that the intent? They would thereby pick up where I was just referring to, some of those terminal illnesses where autopsies would not be required. Unfortunately, there are a lot of those cases in this province, as we know.</p>
<p>I think there's an opportunity here to add to what has been put forward, and that is, could paramedics also - given the fact that we're going out to the doors and homes of these people - be able to sign off on these? Is it an ACP? Is it something that even a basic-level paramedic could do, since they can pronounce? Maybe you're on the phone to a medical control physician - we have those kinds of things available to us. You go through a protocol before you would ever leave a home when you've pronounced somebody is deceased; there are all of these things. There are times when it can't be done for obvious reasons, there are a number of circumstances where death happens that we understand you need a medical examiner or somebody from that office, you require an autopsy, there are investigations, there's any number of things. But there are a lot of cases where I think we can build on this, there are opportunities.</p>
<p>Back to the nurse practitioner bit, I think that's great. Not that we have too many of them yet, I think it's something that we're going down the road of and we can certainly use more. I've got a great example of one, and I'm very proud of her, and that is Dawn Lowe in Hantsport who's doing a bang-up job down there, number one, and has been all along; and number two, without a doctor now present she's doing it all, the workload is heavy. So now that we're adding to Dawn's - as an example, we're going to give her this extra ability or privilege - call it what you like - to go out and do these. Where she's going to find the time, I don't know. These nurse practitioners are very, very busy in these offices, and certainly without a doctor present.</p>
<p>But I think this is a great piece of legislation and I commend the member for Lunenburg for bringing this forward. I also commend the minister for passing that credit on to you; that doesn't happen a lot of times and I think that's a very nice gesture, and it's good to see someone in the backbench who's not just sitting in the backbench and has no ideas. We all know that every member in this House has good ideas when it comes to legislation, regardless of what Party you may be with, and I think that all too many times that is not recognized. It doesn't just have to come from a minister and/or their department, so hats off to you, member for Lunenburg, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I did want to take a few minutes to speak to this issue. I realize that there's openness to this ability in the bill, but other things could be considered. I would hope that the minister, the department and others would take the time to have a look at it; maybe it can't be done, but can it be done. Is it an opportunity yet again to expand the scope of those front-line health care emergency providers, i.e., paramedics in this case, who are very, very well trained in how to determine not only how to save a life but how to present one as no longer alive and unfortunately gone.</p>
<p>I think there is an opportunity, if you look at cost-saving opportunities and such, if they're there it saves somebody else going out - there's hours, there are a lot of things to be considered. I guess the unfortunate piece to this whole thing is, as others have spoken to, we're looking at an opportunity to speed up the process to make the list get longer, and the waits get longer in some cases and that's unfortunate.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this is all going to play out at the end of the day. I haven't talked to a couple of guys I know well who are in the funeral business as to how they're going to feel about this. It is a long time to wait; unfortunately, we can't control when death happens, and it's just that simple. Whether it's something that's terminal or otherwise you could easily die, pass away on a Friday evening, unexpectedly, and then have to wait until Monday to have an autopsy done. There are a number of things and when it gets further along, I think that the undertakers and embalmers and such will tell you likely that - well, I know for a fact having gone through it with family members, it does depend on how long you wait before you have the opportunity, if you're going to be laid out traditionally, to be embalmed.</p>
<p>Everybody wants their family members, for whatever reason, to look good, to look appropriate. It's all part of that grieving process, it's all part of the preparation and the funeral process and traditional process. But it is one of those things and it does sound bizarre to say to look good, how do you look good when you're passed away? Anyone who has ever been - and there's a Reverend Minister over there, I know others who would say yeah that's right, it's part of that process whereby there's an understanding, family members, it's part of whatever reason, they want their family members to look good. Well, that's important, you know, it's the last time they're going to see them; there are a number of factors that come into play here. (Interruption)</p>
<p>It's a bit of a challenge. I guess what I'm saying is - not to make light of it at all - it is a challenge and the challenge is now extended by, perhaps in some cases, two or three days. It makes the challenge even more difficult for those in the funeral business to do what they need to do, and can do very well, in certain circumstances. It is a bit of an interesting piece whereby that could be delayed, it may make a difference, it may increase such things as cremations, and maybe it takes away even more.</p>
<p>We know that the traditional funerals are going more by the wayside. The numbers, I think, most would tell you are up by way of cremation, so maybe it will increase the number of cremations that take place, I don't know, but I do think that there is some consideration that does have to be given - that's reconsideration has to be given as to whether that's the right direction to go by way of delaying autopsies over weekends.</p>
<p>I know that there is a cost associated with it; there's a cost associated with many things. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what the right resolution is, I know that it has worked in the past, I know that there are contracts and overtime, and there's always money involved but, unfortunately, here we are right to the bitter end putting the God Almighty dollar ahead of everything else. There are times when you, just morally I think, and ethically, can't do that. You have to give that some serious consideration.</p>
<p>So I hope that this will come back, that piece will come back at least with some reconsideration, some changes to it. Maybe it's more staffing - and I don't even know what the possibilities are there - maybe it's regular shifts for weekends. I know when I was first in as a paramedic, I worked regular shifts - Friday, Saturday, Sunday, it didn't matter what day of the week it was. It doesn't matter what day of the week it is when you pass away. You don't plan your death, and no one does, around what day of the week it is, it just doesn't happen. So I would again ask that very serious consideration be given to that.</p>
<p>Back to this particular bill and, as I said, Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. I think this is good. The additions are good in the fact that we can open this up to nurse practitioners, but I would like to see some thoughts going into paramedics and how that might also fit in, given that they are there, they will be called, they continue to be called to go out and have the unfortunate task of pronouncing somebody as passed away - and they have the ability to do that both in training, they have the technical equipment that they need to do that, and in some cases they have the ability to get a physician on-line who says, did you meet this protocol, did you do this, this, this and this? Yes you did, fine, we agree, sign the appropriate paperwork.</p>
<p>You're signing all of that paperwork, you're going through that process anyway, Madam Speaker, you might as well sign a death certificate, in my opinion, and then the family has either had arrangements made or can get on with arrangements and it can be done. I think that there's a great ability to speed this process up because it is a hard and very, very difficult time for all families, regardless. In terminal cases where it's expected or not, it is still a very, very difficult time when the time does come - it doesn't seem to make a lot of difference whether it's expected or otherwise.</p>
<p>So with those few words, Madam Speaker, I will thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill this morning and I will take my seat.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Lunenburg.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e982c6e5-fb79-443d-935a-0340f093a6d8"><from>MS. PAM BIRDSALL</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to stand in my place today to speak about the amendments to the Vital Statistics Act, the Timely Medical Certificates Act, which will authorize nurse practitioners and medical investigators employed by the Chief Medical Examiner's Office to sign medical certificates of death in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to have listened to my colleagues across the floor speak of various aspects of this amendment and what it will bring. The possibilities in the future, I think, will be interesting to watch. We'll define all these things through regulation, and paramedics have been mentioned - we'll see how other people are worked into this whole process.</p>
<p>The Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations said when he introduced the bill, "Losing a loved one is painful enough. We want to ensure that grieving families don't have to wait, and can make arrangements as quickly as possible." Madam Speaker, I think that this is a very important thing, and this change to legislation is important to Nova Scotians in rural areas where doctors are in high demand and nurse practitioners fill a vital role in our small communities.</p>
<p>I know in our area we have high fluxes back and forth between doctors - doctors here on a training course are here for two years and then they go on to bigger areas, to urban areas, and our nurse practitioners are the ones who take the heavy load. As my colleague, the member for Kings West, has said, the nurse practitioners will have a heavier load being given this extra authority, and yet this is something that our communities do welcome.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, all members of the Legislative Assembly know that their role is to listen to their constituents, hear their issues and see how they can help them in whatever way is possible. This really important role is sometimes worked into amendments to legislation; legislation that may have worked at the time, but amendments really are necessary to make it relevant. I think that changing the Medical Certificate Act is one of those things.</p>
<p>This piece of legislation started in 2010. When I had a conversation with some of my constituents in New Germany, an elderly gentleman told me that his mother, who was even older, was ill and at home and had services of caregivers coming into the home. He was very worried because he didn't have a doctor and he was concerned about the whole issue of medical certificates and death certificates when his elderly mother passed on. He said, you know, this is something where, really, there should be a law that nurse practitioners have the ability to sign medical certificates. It was one of those "aha" moments for me. I thought, you are absolutely right, this is exactly what is needed, so this seemed like the perfect piece of legislation.</p>
<p>I put together a request for legislation, asking that this, in fact, could be something to be looked at by our legislative committee. I have the honour to be on the legislative committee at this point and I was very gratified to see this piece of legislation come through our committee and see that my colleagues did, in fact, agree that this should be moved forward and I looked forward to it coming to the House where it could be given ample debate by colleagues across the floor and all members of the House.</p>
<p>This legislation will help the over 116 nurse practitioners in the province broaden their scope of practice. They have so many skills and so much compassion, so much ability, and I think working with people who are at the end of life is something that they are highly skilled at and that they are welcomed into the family in many ways and often become part of the family, through that very difficult duration of time.</p>
<p>I think that nurse practitioners seem to fill that role, often, as a distant cousin or someone whose heart becomes involved with the patient they are caring for. These are the sorts of deaths that they will easily be able to sign. The legislation does define that they are able to sign these medical death certificates, under certain circumstances, and the circumstances will be just that - people for whom they may have worked with for long periods of time, know well, and the death is expected.</p>
<p>Sudden death and death that is questionable will be one of the areas that will not be covered under this legislation. Those will be looked at by, obviously, medical examiners and doctors. Also, at this point, medical investigators are noted in this piece of legislation and, through regulation, we'll see in just what circumstance they will be able to sign a death certificate.</p>
<p>Public consultations have gone on this past summer with stakeholders and it was very clear that they were in support of this sort of legislation. I think one of the important things we want to note is that this legislation is very much in line with the Department of Health and Wellness and their whole idea of expanding the scope of practice for nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>The legislation was then drafted and presented to the legislative committee for approval. As I said, I was very pleased when the committee looked at this and agreed that it should move forward.</p>
<p>Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with many years of advanced training. This advanced training allows them to diagnose and prescribe medication for people and be able to treat illness and will be going further training, as we said, for other areas.</p>
<p>In my Lunenburg constituency, nurse practitioners work very hard in homes for special care and medical clinics. In my area we have a wonderful home for special care in New Germany called Rosedale Home for Special Care, which just recently had a whole new addition built. It is an absolutely beautiful home where the patients, or clients, are treated as family. Just recently, in the Fall, there was a barbeque where friends and family were invited to the home for special care. I was able to talk with a lot of our constituents there who are so grateful that their loved ones are in such a beautiful place and where their needs are so attended to. There, as well, they have a very special relationship with the nurse practitioners in the area.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I would like to also speak about the New Germany Medical Centre. This medical centre is a centre that my constituency is incredibly proud of. Back in the day, in the early 1990s, their doctor, who had been in the area for a very long time and served the community, left. The community got together and said, what we need is a community medical centre. So they decided that they would follow the old adage, "If you build it, they will come," hoping that once they built a medical centre their doctor would come - which, in fact, did happen.</p>
<p>The community got together and spoke amongst themselves and said, what do we need for a medical centre? The logical first step was to talk to a contractor. The contractor quoted $200,000 for the cost of the medical clinic. The volunteers of the community felt this was far more than they wanted to invest, so they themselves started to collect donations from members of the community. They worked out exactly what it would cost if they got donations of building supplies and if they had contractors donate equipment and their skills and planning. In fact, they knocked on many doors to get the kind of donations they needed.</p>
<p>This medical centre now is open five days a week and has the services of Dr. Barbara O'Neil and nurse practitioner Dawn Chubbs. When they went through this whole process of building the community centre, I think it showed the huge level of community spirit and the level of engagement and commitment that the people of New Germany and the whole surrounding area had, to create such a wonderful centre.</p>
<p>On the official day of the opening, which was in July 1993, the sod was turned and in three months the building was complete - from July 6<sup>th</sup> to October 30<sup>th</sup> to build a building. They raised $150,000 and they used $70,000 to build it. I think that's absolutely remarkable, given the times we have now and looking at the overruns of costs for hospitals in areas. This shows that these things can be done.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable things that happened with the construction of this building was that when the roof trusses were in place they had a shingling day, and it took 27 people from 9:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. to completely shingle the roof. I think this one act shows exactly how determined these people were and how they were working together.</p>
<p>The official ribbon-cutting ceremony was on December 5, 1993. The ribbon was cut by Ivan Daniels and Victor Porter. The CBC was there to cover that, and everyone in the community was very proud that it was on the CBC News. After the opening they all went to the community centre and had a traditional New Germany tea, and I think were very self-congratulatory - and certainly should have been at the time. It was a wonderful achievement for the area.</p>
<p>Our nurse practitioner enjoys working there every day. When the building was complete, the doctor at the time thought it was an absolutely wonderful place to work. In speaking about the building, I'd also like to say that the land the building sits on was donated by Ronald and Patricia Smith and was signed over to the New Germany Medical Centre through the donated services of a local lawyer, Donald Taylor. An honoured member of our community, Bill Alexander, was the project manager, who worked tirelessly to get donated building materials and keep his team rallied. Key people on the committee were: Ralston Eisner, Murray Ward, Greg Selig, Ruth van Iderstine, Harold Hubley, Vivian Meisner, Bill Alexander, Robert Zinck, Allister Silver, James Hennigar, Dale Joudrey, and Harold Weiland. I think it's really important to have these names noted through our Hansard system, so that this is in the history of the province.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry Meisner and Fletcher Verner were the two main people who walked door to door, knocking and asking for donations which raised the ultimate money for this building. When they went through the building and found that they were able to construct it for $70,000, with the remaining money that they had left over they were able to upgrade before the building even started, upgrading their plans by including air conditioning, a security system, a paved parking lot, and many more things. That was in 1993 and over the last decade time has moved on. The building has required repair and upgrade, which is all through donation in the area.</p>
<p>The kind of support that the medical centre gives us is very involved. They're able to give us clinics through the week, through the five days of the week. There are foot clinics, hearing clinics, well women's clinics, breast screening clinics, flu shots, blood collection, and all manner of health care. We know that it's really wonderful for people in the area to be able to avail themselves of these services. People come from a very long radius, far away to get to New Germany and when you're working from Lunenburg and Mahone Bay as a central part of the constituency of Lunenburg, you forget that when you look at the map, New Germany is also the core of a much bigger area and those are the people who, from different constituencies, come to that area. Parkdale-Maplewood is a really important part of my constituency there and they are so enamoured of their clinic. They were definitely part of the whole building and donation and the maintaining and keeping it all going.</p>
<p>We know that these clinics such as foot clinics where the VON comes in and works with clients on a regular basis are very important, especially to elderly people in my area. Hearing clinics also really impact on seniors in my area and they come regularly to be checked. We understand how important hearing clinics can be and for elderly people missing the subtlety of life through auditory challenges really can lower the quality of their life and having hearing clinics certainly can help them. It alerts them to any issues that they're having and can prescribe the sorts of remediation that can help them live a much better quality of life.</p>
<p>The well women's clinic is an important thing, as well, in the area and this is all range and all manner of women. Younger women are encouraged to come in and they're having clinics in the schools to talk to some of these young people, to talk about issues around women and breast screening and, obviously, this is something that is very important to all women. These clinics will help in the prevention of breast cancer and be able to prolong someone's life if, in fact, they have some sort of challenge in that area.</p>
<p>This is the time of year people are thinking about flu shots and this is a service that really does help in so many ways. The distance travelled, again, as I mentioned earlier, is something that makes it so much easier. If someone has to go from Parkdale-Maplewood, or the New Germany area, down to Bridgewater, it's quite a hike from that area and for elderly people it's a whole day's travel. It can be quite stressful for them trying to find transportation, if they don't have transportation, to get to Bridgewater to the hospital there. Blood collection is another service that the centre does offer.</p>
<p>This new legislation will enable nurse practitioner Dawn Chubbs, and nurse practitioners all over the province to help families at such an emotional time. I think that right across the province young women and young men, who are coming into this role of becoming a nurse practitioner, will now see this as a new aspect of their scope of practice and I think there's some sort of completion that can happen in their care for people. If they're working in nursing homes, and do become attached to the clients, as I said, by actually signing the death certificate it lends a completion to the act.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think nurse practitioners will be extremely pleased with this change and as Donna Denney, the executive director of the College of Registered Nurses of Nova Scotia, recently said just that. "Nurse practitioners will be extremely pleased with this change. It will help families cope with the loss of a loved one, particularly in long-term and palliative care settings, in a dignified and respectful manner."</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to see this legislation move forward with the support of all members of the House. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b2b87f1a-a4cb-471a-aff0-6b0dba2c86c4"><from>MR. MAURICE SMITH</from><p>Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in my place to address the House on second reading of Bill No. 72, an Act to Amend Chapter 494 of the Revised Statutes of 1989. The Vital Statistics Act.</p>
<p>Bill No. 72 deals with amendments to the section of the Vital Statistics Act concerning the issuing of medical certificates of death. The Act's short title is therefore aptly called the Timely Medical Certificates Act. The raison d'&#xFFFD;tre of this bill is to authorize others, at this time specifically nurse practitioners, of course besides doctors and the coroner or the medical examiner, to issue death certificates.</p>
<p>As you may know, until the death certificate has been issued, a body cannot be removed by the funeral director. This has, in the past, caused hardship and angst to family members who would sometimes have to wait for hours for a doctor to come to their home to deal with pronouncing the person dead and issuing the death certificate. In rural areas, particularly where there is no hospital in the immediate area and no doctor at hand, this delay was often prolonged.</p>
<p>The Timely Medical Certificates Act is a good piece of legislation, which will make it much easier for people who are suffering the loss of a loved one to deal with the remains without significant delay. Nurse practitioners have been chosen as the logical persons to be authorized to issue the death certificate. Often they are very familiar with the deceased and the family, having been on the scene during the deceased's last illness. Often they are actually with the deceased and the family at the time of death. They have the expertise and knowledge to assess the situation and will be given additional training to handle this delicate matter. That training will focus on identifying the cause of death and completing the necessary paperwork.</p>
<p>Regulations will be drafted which will define the circumstances under which a nurse practitioner and other authorized persons will be permitted to sign the medical certificate of death. These regulations will set out the criteria and conditions which will detail when and where a nurse practitioner, or other persons authorized, can sign a death certificate.</p>
<p>Nurse practitioners have been chosen to fulfill this task because of their expertise. They are becoming a much more important component of our health care system. Their roles are expanding throughout the system. This is in keeping with the Department of Health and Wellness view of better utilizing the skills of our health care workers. Nurse practitioners are now working in nursing homes to decrease the need for elderly people to go to ERs for ailments that can be assessed and treated on-site.</p>
<p>Currently in Nova Scotia we have well over 100 nurse practitioners with an active practising nurse practitioner licence. Tapping into this resource to assist people in rural areas makes good sense. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education. They have the knowledge and skill to diagnose and treat illnesses and deal with one's health concerns. They work closely with the patient and the patient's family, and more broadly in the community to find ways to promote everyone's health and well-being.</p>
<p>Nurse practitioners involve the patient in decisions about the patient's own health care. They also work closely with other health care professionals, especially the patient's own doctor, to make sure that patients receive the best care possible. Their expertise, training, and experience make them the obvious and best choice to perform this sensitive and very important task.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the proposed changes, there was consultation with the stakeholders involved and there is broad support of this move to allow nurse practitioners to sign medical certificates of death. This legislation is in response to a perceived need and a direct call for intervention. This bill, and the improvements that it brings, will make life better for Nova Scotians and ensure that families can deal with the death of a loved one in a timely and respectful manner. Those are the comments I wish to make, Madam Speaker, thank you very much.</p></speech>

I think we recognize as a government the importance of making sure that our legislation and policies that we have in place are current and can best serve Nova Scotians, and I think that's why this piece of legislation was brought forward.</p>
<p>I had discussions with the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations on this specific piece of legislation. We've heard from our colleagues across the way and understand some of their comments and their concerns, and I appreciate most of their comments and concerns. I know the member for Hants West and the member for Argyle, for example, with their interactions as a first responder and as a paramedic and my previous experience as a paramedic, understand the need to ensure that this legislation is open to allow future changes to the policy. That's why in this legislation we recognize that and we indicate that that qualified person authorized through regulations is permitted and will be looked at in the future as really these policies have to have the ability to change.</p>
<p>I appreciate the comments from the members and we'll look forward to this piece of legislation going through because I think it truly does best serve Nova Scotians, especially when you're dealing with a difficult situation like a death in the family, or a death, Madam Speaker. On behalf of the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations I close debate on Bill No. 72.</p></speech>
