<p>Whereas on May 23, 2013, as a candidate the Liberal member for Halifax Atlantic wrote, saying, "I was a proud member of CEP for 10 years who stopped on a picket line and have been a PROUD, supportive, active member of CUPE Local 227 for the last three years. We protect middle class jobs"; and</p>
<p>Whereas health care workers and many Nova Scotians have made it clear that essential services legislation creates more unstable collective bargaining in jurisdictions where it exists; and</p>
<p>Whereas Liberals typically say one thing to get into power and another while in power;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that since the Liberal member for Halifax Atlantic was a proud member of CEP and CUPE, that he should speak out against essential services legislation, the Premier and the Liberal Cabinet, and stand up for health care workers who live in Halifax Atlantic.</p>

<p>Whereas many dedicated parents, teachers, and other individuals, including those at Autism Nova Scotia, work tirelessly to make our province more accessible for people with autism and find ways for them to thrive in our communities; and</p>

<p>Whereas the Liberal Government has brought forward two pieces of back-to-work legislation in the first seven months of its mandate, which continues their track record of disrespecting health care workers and the collective bargaining process;</p>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Capital Health, yesterday, issued a media release saying; "We have many more patients currently in the queue than we can safety care for&#x2026;" I will table that for the House.</p>
<p>My question for the Premier, will he now admit that patient care has already been compromised?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5">
            <from>HON. STEPHEN MACNEIL</from>
            <p>(The Premier): Mr. Speaker, I would say to the honourable member that yesterday the wildcat strike that took place obviously caused some major concerns for the delivery of health care. I am pleased to see that those health care workers are back on the job and it is my hope that we will have passage of Bill No. 37 today that will allow the essential services component to be negotiated and then the strike can continue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there were 89 surgeries cancelled yesterday, five of which were heart surgeries. Many patients, who made their way to the hospital, only found out when they got there that their surgery was going to be cancelled. That is the case here at Capital Health but surgeries are being cancelled at other health authorities around the province as well, so once again we are faced with that same old story where we have chaos in our health care system and a government that, again, waited until the last minute to deal with it and take action.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question for the Premier is, will he explain why he waited until the eve of a strike to decide that nurses are essential to our system, when it was clear for weeks that there was a deadline of April 3<sup>rd</sup>?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>It was my hope, Mr. Speaker, that a resolution could have been resolved at the bargaining table. As the member opposite would know, there was a strike notice put in on Monday morning to give 48 hours' notice. What we have put in place, quite frankly, is the very thing that the Leader of the Official Opposition is now complaining about - putting in place some certainty for those patients so that they know, if there is going to be a labour disruption in the health care system, what services will be available. They will know well in advance; those won't be negotiated in the final hours.</p>
<p>We are now spending more time arguing about what is an emergency and what isn't. What we are asking for and what this legislation puts in place, Mr. Speaker, is what an essential service is, what will be covered, and then the labour disruption can happen.</p></speech>

<p>Here we are, on the eve of a strike, yesterday 89 surgeries were cancelled at Capital Health, 30 more at Annapolis Health and many more around the province. I'll ask the Premier quite simply, why didn't he take his own advice, which he issued before the election, instead of letting 100 Nova Scotians go without their surgery yesterday?</p></speech>

Nurses' agreements with the Capital Health District contain an MOU that they negotiate emergency services in the event of a strike. I'll table a letter dated March 5<sup>th</sup> of this year, from the union to the employer at Capital Health. This letter states:</p>
<blockquote>"The Union and the Employer are required by the Collective Agreement to negotiate these services &#x2026; Often the parties come to an agreement on the level of services. In those circumstances where the parties cannot agree, the MOA and our past practice has an arbitrator make a fast, on the spot decision. This has led to a fair and quick resolution of an emergency service agreement."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after announcing just a few hours ago that an emergency services agreement was in place, we are now hearing that the employer has changed its mind. I want to ask the Premier what, if any, discussions did he or members of his government have with Capital Health that may have caused this reversal?</p></speech>

The nurses have been attempting to negotiate an essential services agreement with their employer for several weeks now. Almost a full month this has been on the table.</p>
<p>Nurses working for Capital Health came here yesterday and they told us they do not want to go on strike, but they feel they must to fight for improvements in staffing levels to improve patient safety over the long term. Nurses always offer emergency services, but when the employer won't agree with the level, there are arbitrators who step in.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question for the Premier is, now that the nurses are in a legal strike position for Thursday morning, will the Premier advise the employer to agree to respect their memorandum of understanding, and allow an arbitrator to make a fair and quick resolution to ensure emergency services are in place?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. As we now know the Premier once said in writing that essential services plans should only be made well in advance of a potential strike and never on the eve of a strike. He has been in office for almost six months now and during that time we had a brief, 11-day Fall session and there are very few pieces of legislation before this session of the House. There has been lots of notice to get this right. My question to the Premier is, after six months and lots of notice, how does doing nothing for six months protect patient care?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this bill before the House very clearly lays out process that would allow, quite frankly, for both sides to negotiate an essential services package well in advance of a labour disruption, as well as protecting the right of health care workers to strike, unlike the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party who wants to strip that right away from health care workers.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, when a government waits until the last minute, the heated rhetoric takes over, people take hard sides, and good oversight of our health system goes out the window - that is the problem. That is why 100 Nova Scotians went without their scheduled surgeries yesterday. That is the greatest argument for doing something when there is labour calm and not waiting for the most recent crisis. Those 100 Nova Scotians went without their health care yesterday. So I will ask the Premier, how can he tell those 100 Nova Scotians that he is protecting their care?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, very simply, in the last seven months we've had three potential labour disruptions in the health care sector in the Province of Nova Scotia with different employers, different unions. What this bill lays out is that we lay out a piece of essential services legislation well in advance of that labour disruption. I would hope the Leader of the Official Opposition will support the passage of this bill so we can see it go forward in this House.</p>
<p>One difference between the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and this Premier is I believe health care workers should have the right to strike and this bill protects it.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we just heard from over 100 health care workers in the last two days who have a very different view of what the Premier is doing around their rights and what he just said. Quite frankly, although we have lots of problems with the bill the government has brought forward in this House, we are doing the responsible thing. In fact, I believe we are cleaning up his mess by not getting in the way so that bill can be in place, as it inevitably will because of the Liberal majority, so a strike can be avoided. That is what's going on in the House this week.</p>
<p>It doesn't change the fact that 100 Nova Scotians went without their surgery yesterday and the Premier had six months and, by his own admission, three warnings to get his act together and get something in place long before it reached another crisis. I will ask the Premier to explain to those 100 Nova Scotians, who had their surgeries cancelled yesterday, why they have to pay for his six months of inaction.</p></speech>

Today in allnovascotia.com it references a March 5, 2014, commitment of $500,000. I will document that as well.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Yesterday at the Law Amendments Committee the president of the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union came here to speak about Bill No. 37. Now, she and her union have a collective agreement in place for nurses all across the province outside of the Capital District Health Authority, in all of our regional hospitals and small health centres. Ms. Hazelton said she was shocked by the breadth of the bill and the lack of consultation. To quote Ms. Hazelton, she said, "There was no consultation, there was no discussion." Knowing this piece of legislation will have serious implications for health care workers, I want to ask the Premier why he chose not to consult with people like Ms. Hazelton before this legislation was brought forward.</p>

The minister responded, "I think the member opposite will find that, in fact, his hospital will have the nurse complement and the teams in place to deliver services to the people of the Hants West area." Yesterday in the Hants Journal, it was reported that as many as 26 surgeries in the Valley area were to be cancelled.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we know that once a strike gets underway, because of the integrated nature of our health care system, then it's going to have impacts certainly on four or five of the surrounding hospitals to Capital Health, and in this case we know that has now taken place. I feel very, very strongly that this is why, because of the nature of the group we're talking about here and the requirements of health care that we need to know well in advance what Nova Scotians in an impacted hospital or community of hospitals would be receiving for care. Patients do need to know well in advance as to what services they can count on if, indeed, there is a strike.</p>

I attended the Law Amendments Committee yesterday morning when it began at 9:00 a.m. I listened intently to the witnesses who shared their experiences and asked them questions and made a note of potential amendments. I was upset when the acting chairman cut me off when I was asking important questions of witnesses.

            <p>My question today is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Yesterday, the Minister of Health and Wellness announced that family members of Canadian Forces members will receive first-day coverage for all insured services. I can only imagine how excited Canadian Forces members will be to learn that their families will have first-day access to a Nova Scotia health system that is in chaos. Will the minister admit that the state of Nova Scotia's health care system this week will only increase the anxiety of Forces members who are moving their families here?</p>

LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, to the member for Pictou East, having had really the good fortune to travel across Nova Scotia in the last couple of months, I can sincerely say that on every day, every facility, every group of people I met - in fact, I was inspired by their work and their commitment.</p>
<p>I know from my home community of Kingston-Greenwood that when members come in to take up their tour of duty, they've had to get services paid for by the province from which they have come for the first three months. This enables them to quickly make the transfer to our province and, even though on occasion some have had that challenge of getting a family doctor, when they go to the emergency department at Soldiers' Memorial or at Valley Regional, or access any of the other community based programs, they talk about the quality of care and the responsiveness of the service they receive.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm sure Nova Scotians appreciate the fact that the minister did travel the province. I sincerely hope that when he travelled the province, he listened to those health care professionals and maybe even engaged them and asked them a question or two, because what we saw yesterday in 19 hours of testimony in the committee room over there was not a lot of interest from the Liberal Caucus. So hopefully when he was on his tour he did a little different.</p>
<p>When you think about all of the things that were happening in this building yesterday, with over 100 nurses telling their stories, the timing of the minister's press release, given the impending strike, is puzzling at best and offensive at worst. Will the minister apologize to military families for his ill-timed, embarrassing press release?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>I thank the member opposite for the question. When I'm contacted by members of the Canadian military that are in my community and quickly engage in all of the activities that go on, they have only positive things to say about their experience with the care locally, and if they have to come here for tertiary level care in this province. Sometimes our perceptions can be skewed by one event.</p>
<p>But the overall picture in our province, and as the member well knows, the member really knows the quality of care that they receive in Pictou and Aberdeen and at that outstanding collaborative care centre and that is typical, in fact, of what we receive across Nova Scotia.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, families posted to Nova Scotia are coming to a province with the highest taxes, the highest power rates, and now the most chaotic health system in the country.</p>
<p>Will the minister tell this House what other costly surprises are in store for military families, courtesy of the Liberal Welcome Wagon?</p></speech>

            <p>I can speak first and foremost for the community where I live. Thanks to the work of the previous government and the Annapolis Valley District Health Authority, because they have been hearing from their local member that there weren't enough family doctors over the past three years, we now have a community medical centre alongside the military base 14 Wing Greenwood that looks after those military families that have had the most difficult time in the past, and that is spouses. Now the military community in our area can get same-day or next-day care. That is a great advance, and I'm sure we would find that in other military communities across our province.</p>

<p>During the election, the MLA for Halifax Atlantic described himself as - and I will table this - a proud supporter and active member of CUPE. Yet upon hearing the testimony from unionized health care workers, the MLA refused to ask questions, even when asked to by the presenters. He refused to even speak in favour of his own motion to take away the people's right to speak at Law Amendments Committee.</p>
<p>My question through you, Mr. Speaker, to the Premier is, how did he convince the member for Halifax Atlantic to betray his principles and remain silent during Law Amendments Committee, not asking a single question?</p></speech>

<p>In this piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, we put in place essential services legislation that would provide services to health care patients, while at the same time, we are protecting the right to strike.

This bill does that.

I asked him what he heard from the nurses, over 100 if not more, who were in our own Chamber over the last day or so. I'll fill the Premier in on one of those testimonies that I heard throughout the testimonies that we heard yesterday.</p>
<p>We heard from a nurse, Trish MacDonald, a nurse here in Halifax, who told us about one of the worst shifts she has worked in over 27 years as a nurse, a shift that happened less than 48 hours ago. Her story was heartbreaking, unbelievable. While working short-staffed, one of her patients died and another patient had to be cardioverted or shocked five times, while awake. Imagine working under those conditions.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the Premier, why does the Premier think it is okay for nurses like Trish MacDonald to be put in situations like the one I just described?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to extend my condolences to the family, but no Nova Scotian would want to see any health care provider put in the circumstances that he's describing. The fact of the matter is what we've clearly laid out has been in a piece of essential services legislation, which provides services to those patients, as well as protecting the right to strike.</p>
<p>As I've said many times in this House, the Minister of Health and Wellness is travelling this province, looking at issues as we merge nine district health authorities into one; looking at the very thing that he is talking about, which would be ensuring that we have the right mix of staff. There is nowhere else in the country where we put in staffing ratios. There are plenty of places where we have essential services. That is what we're focused on today to ensure those services are in place. The minister will embark on ensuring that the staff levels are correct in hospitals all across this province.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the situation I just described wouldn't be any better under essential services legislation. This happened while nurses like Trish were at work, working understaffed, shift after shift. Trish told the Law Amendments Committee that her working conditions are unbearable and that she is prepared to sacrifice over $20,000 in pension just to be able to retire two years early. That is unimaginable. I can't imagine health care workers needing to make that decision. We know how challenging it is when you are retired. I would like to ask the Premier, why does the Premier think it is fair for nurses like Trish, and hundreds of others in this province who have worked almost 30 years as a nursing professional in Nova Scotia to now be making those decisions?</p>

<p>I also want to be very clear that the Minister of Health and Wellness is actually out engaged in conversations about the very issues that are being brought to us by nurses about the issues, about staffing on floors not only in the Capital District but across the province. I'm very proud of the work that he's been doing on behalf of all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I believe nurses are feeling the way they are is because for four years they had a government that wouldn't listen and neglected. If they wanted to fix the problem, they could have fixed it before October.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Yesterday there was a CBC news article in which Chris Power, the CEO of the Capital District Health Authority, said that Capital Health addictions have been really affected by what has gone on in the last few days. I'm asking the minister, could he give some detail as to what the potential impact is going to be for services to these folk?</p>

            <p>I know there have been a couple of situations to date where patients, who were in an unstabilized manner, did get removed from Capital Health and out to other centres where comparable services are available. But the member opposite is speaking to a problem that exists right across Nova Scotia, one that some gains have been made. There are many other areas of support for our addicted community and those with addictions and mental health requirements, not just during the current labour disruption but areas that will need ongoing support, more clinicians to make sure that they are looked after.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I do really appreciate the complexity of this particular situation. There are a lot of programs for folks with addictions, such as counselling, in-patient treatments, day treatment programs, recovery groups, and support for family members and others that might be affected. My question to the minister is, do you have any suggestions as to where these people might go so that they can be supported when these issues come up?</p>

            <p>It almost sounds like we're into estimates already, and I need to give that whole panoramic picture of what happens across the province. But I know in terms of, yes, this was one of the areas, and in fact I know, having put a lot of time, a lot of energy, done a considerable amount of research in this area over the last couple of years because of the impacts of many deaths in a short time in the Annapolis Valley. I know that having the crisis line and crisis team available is one of those areas that is maintained. However, there are some services that are not at the strength that they normally would be if we didn't have this labour disruption. But I'm hearing so far, and it just involves a matter of hours so far, and I know patients that were in trouble did get moved to centres where professionals could assist them.</p>

            <p>I appreciate that, minister. It not only helps the folks seeking information on how to treat their addictions, but also provides support for the recovery period afterwards. I'm going to ask the minister, are these services going to be in place once the people leave the particular centres or whatever, because the recovery period is extremely important for people with addictions?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, to the member - who asks a very important question - we know this is one of the reasons why we have changed the model of care in terms of mental health. Psychiatric patients, after getting the help - whether at the IWK or in one of our other hospitals across the province - when they go back to their communities, making sure that they have a number of supports in place is really at the heart of this model. At the present time we don't have enough providers right across our province. It's an area where I know we will be providing some additional supports. Dr. Jana Davidson gave not just the IWK but our province one of the best reports, with 14 very specific, concrete recommendations that we have started on. That report will be supported by our budget.</p>

When a judge orders an individual to be placed in the care of the East Coast Forensic Hospital, there are certain expectations regarding treatment. Because this hospital does not have the ability to turn away patients, Capital Health has reported that staffing levels for the hospital are unsafe in the event of a work stoppage. While this situation is due to a labour dispute in health care, it is well within the purview of the Minister of Justice.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. Yesterday and today, my colleagues and I heard from dozens and dozens of health care workers at the Law Amendments Committee. And it wasn't just health care workers; it was citizens who support health care, who support nurses. Their stories were eye-opening. Some were just plain shocking as I sat there and listened to their testimony to the Law Amendments Committee. I'd like to ask the minister, I'm wondering, did the minister make a point to hear any of those stories at the Law Amendments Committee and, if not, why not?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, over the past couple of weeks, really over the past couple of months now I, in fact, have been hearing from nurses and many health care providers. In the last couple of weeks prior to arriving at the disruption that we currently have, I started hearing from others. I am becoming acquainted with their stories, with the challenges that they do face. I know as we got unfortunately close to yesterday and the disruption, back toward the end of last week, I was planning a full day at the QEII, starting with doctor rounds in the morning, meeting a number of nurses. Most felt that perhaps in the current climate that it may not be best executed.</p>
<p>But certainly I will give all nurses at the QEII my time, not in the current environment, but an opportunity to sit down and have them give me in fine detail what their staffing issues are. All across North America there is, in fact, one primary model where staffing committees meet to deal with ordinary staffing challenges, also critical staffing challenges. If there are interventions and corrections that need to take place, I will certainly be there, not just to hear them, but to make sure that there are improvements as we move forward.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think it's important that the Minister of Health and Wellness travelled the province. We heard it time and time again from the Premier and the minister. But the minister just had to walk about 50 feet across the floor of this Legislature over the last two days to hear from front-line health care workers, from nurses, and hear exactly what it's like to work on the burn unit that's understaffed, to work in the ICU that's understaffed, and it's a challenge. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>I hear some comments from across the way. I didn't hear any comments in the Law Amendments Committee. They never asked one question. One story that we heard yesterday was from Jean MacDonald - and I hope the member for Cape Breton-Richmond listens - who is a nurse with 35 years' experience. Jean told the Law Amendments Committee she preferred to work evenings, but felt morally obligated to speak up on behalf of her patients and the young nurses who are coming into the profession.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the minister, does the minister think it's fair for nurses like Jean to be forced to leave their bedsides with the threat of being disciplined, just to try to get a message through to the government here at Province House about the alarming conditions she and many of her colleagues are working under?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, over the past 30 years I've heard stories first-hand at the kitchen table from my wife, who is a nurse. There are many, many stories on a daily basis where nurses, in fact, are challenged in terms of the immediacy of what does take place, the level of training, competencies, ongoing professional development, working as a team and working to get the best results. I'm very familiar on that first-hand basis.</p>
<p>You know the stories of yesterday have been conveyed to me through a number of nurses, in fact as late as the past weekend. I know that one of the things they're very, very quick to tell me, in terms of kind of a concluding statement, is that the conditions, the circumstances they face, didn't all of a sudden happen on October 8<sup>th</sup>.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what we heard time and time again from many of the presenters at Law Amendments Committee is that over the last couple of weeks and month, a new scheduling component was introduced to many of the units. That's where some of the issues is, or are - it's been a long two days. I'm working on five hours of sleep in two days. I apologize if my English isn't correct, and I don't ask for any sympathy, not any at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Jean also told Law Amendments Committee that she is a proud nurse, but it pains her to say that she will no longer recommend the profession, even to a family member. So no matter what the implications are between the government and the union, what we can't do is ignore what we heard over the last two days. The bargaining units and the unions will continue to do what they need to do, so does the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm asking the Minister of Health and Wellness, with what we've heard over the last two days, will the minister accept Jean's testimony, and will he act immediately to try to address some of the serious concerns that we all heard over the last two days that some of our nurses are working under?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, it is unfortunate that we are having to deliberate and deal with one of the most serious issues and one of the most required services that our province needs to have delivered every day, 365 days a year, in the context of a wildcat strike, in the context of all of the testimonials given here at Province House, in Law Amendments Committee. I think there are better tables, better opportunities, for the kind of dialogue that needs to occur.</p>
<p>I am certainly willing. Whether it's one nurse or 400 nurses, I am prepared to meet with them when this issue finally meets a resolve, and that what nurses will tell me, they can be assured I will act upon it. This is one of the areas that, as I get to know the system and those who make it happen every day, it gives me a greater opportunity to be responsive and to make sure that quality patient care remains front and centre in all they do and what we do, as a government.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#aef785d7-7697-4453-8f9c-eef26e4928c3"><from>MR. COLWELL</from><p>It is a very important question to the economy of Nova Scotia. The lobster fishing represents one of the biggest, if not the biggest employer in the whole province and we have to do it right. We have to do it in a timely manner. We have to have consultation with the industry before we put it in place and that is critical. If we're going to move the industry forward on quality, which we have to put in place - and there has not been a lot of discussion around quality, and marketing that we have to do both nationally and internationally - we have to have a quality product first. Of all the reports - a small section of the report talked about quality.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to put this product on the market and market it right away but if you don't have quality - and repeat business because you have quality - it won't work. So we are going to review that whole situation and move forward on it in a solid way and we are going to grow Nova Scotia's economy in the fishery as we have done in the past and previously the value of exports in Nova Scotia had dropped.</p>
<p>When I was minister 15 years ago, we were the biggest exporter of fish in the country and, actually, when you put all the other provinces together, we still had more exports than anyone else or all of them combined. We have now gone neck and neck with New Brunswick and I give them a lot of credit for what they have done as the chief exporters of fish products in the province. The fishing industry is the biggest employer in the province and we have to really make sure, when we move forward, we do it properly with the economy of Nova Scotia in mind.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I would say the testimony that struck me most directly was the young nurse who came to my office recently who sobbed about how working conditions have deteriorated over the last number of years. I can assure the former minister and the current member that, in fact, I took that very seriously. Thank you.</p>

You know to be truthful, not myself, nor any of the members, could recall seeing her there. For a government that campaigned on the promise of transparency, we've seen bills introduced without notice or consultation, and now the minister doesn't want to listen to the very people who are affected by this bill.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask that minister, when will she actually sit down and meet the representatives of the 30,000-plus workers who her legislation impacts?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, our first priority is to protect the safety and the health of Nova Scotians without jeopardizing the right to strike. We have, again, introduced legislation that ensures patients and their families can continue to count on health care essential services during a strike. Thank you.</p>

CORBETT</from><p>You know, Mr. Speaker, during the 2013 election, the member running for the seat in Bedford, now the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education, told The Chronicle Herald the number-one issue in her re-election that she hears is health care. That seems to have gone by the wayside.</p>
<p>I guess I want to ask the minister, which did she do - how much time did she spend in Law Amendments Committee and how much time did she spend hobnobbing with Liberal Senators at their AGM?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in fact that's exactly why we introduced this legislation, because health care is such an important issue. I would note that Nova Scotia is the only province in the country without essential services legislation, and we believe it's high time we had it. Thank you.</p>

As I am sure he is aware, we have got a second town now in Nova Scotia - Bridgetown - that filed for dissolution. There's another town in my constituency. Another town, like many I am sure are considering the same thing and they are wondering where they are going. It certainly has been difficult times in the last recent years.</p>
<p>Hantsport has given notice publicly now that they will also be meeting, on April 9<sup>th</sup> I believe, to discuss this very topic. I'm wondering if the Minister of Municipal Affairs has been contacted and invited to take part in that?</p></speech>

I have the honour of representing all three of those areas. I believe correspondence has been sent, and I don't have it today or I would table it, but I believe it has been sent to the minister with regard to amalgamation. The 'a' word continues to come up, which is not as bad a word as some people might think it is, at least on the discussion - I believe the town had sent the letter, or the mayor on behalf of the Town of Windsor and council, and I wonder, are you taking part in any of those discussions or have you responded to that letter you received?</p>

I would ask this question, given where everything is, I think there are probably some areas or municipal units that are in favour and are working together and talking, and there are others that are not that maybe wish they were, or wonder and desire how that could all take place. Is the minister and/or the government, your department, initiating from within this opportunity to go out and speak and review the number of municipalities in the Province of Nova Scotia?</p>

I just want to follow up on the question of my colleague in Opposition. Over the last three months, we've had extensive discussions, and there is a combination of factors. But it's safe to say that the leadership in our municipal governments are openly discussing amalgamation and it's not the dirty word that it used to be only a few short years ago.</p>
<p>Of the 36 discussions I have had, 34 of the municipalities have put amalgamation on the table as a point of discussion. Our government is there to support them in whatever capacity we can to ensure they find the model of government that they believe is in the best interests of their communities.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. As all members of the House know there was a tragic accident on the Cobequid Pass this past storm that resulted in a young fatality. I know all members of the House would wish to extend their condolences to the family involved. I'd like to ask the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal, has his department undertaken a review of the amount of snow-clearing equipment and the snow-clearing practices on the Cobequid Pass to determine that they are sufficient when we have storms like we had earlier this week?</p>

It's very sad, and obviously when those things happen, our hearts are heavy indeed.</p>
<p>To answer the question specifically, we have undertaken, and we are undertaking, a complete review of all equipment in the province. We hope to have that ready and in place for the next year's winter season. It's a very important question that we had, and I know that we've received it through the department from all members in the House here and from many Nova Scotians. They want to know that we have adequate equipment in place, and that's something that's the least we can do for Nova Scotians so we'll endeavour to do that.</p>
<p>To the member on that specific incident, the RCMP is investigating. We did have a full complement of salt equipment and plowing equipment and patrols out during that day and we did the best we could, but, again, a very tragic incident indeed. Thank you.</p></speech>

Since Bill No. 37 is now on the order paper for Committee of the Whole House discussion, in order to have that bill considered for debate today it would require the unanimous consent of the House.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as you know, notice has been given that there will be a legal strike action as of 7:01 a.m. tomorrow morning, putting the health and safety of Nova Scotians at risk. You will recall that on Bill No. 30 we were able to receive the unanimous consent of the House to not only do Committee of the Whole House, but third reading, but as well we were able to sit on a Saturday for the first time in 28 years due to the importance of this matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the hours for today are until 11:59 p.m. We look forward to the opportunity to be able to have a fulsome discussion on this bill, but in order to do so we would require the consent of the House in order to be able to do that. With that, I would move that the House give its consent that Bill No. 37 be now considered for debate in the Committee of the Whole House process.</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, since the NDP caucus has refused to give consent to allow the Committee of the Whole House process to proceed today, the government has no legislative abilities left in order to continue Bill No. 37 to proceed, until we would start again tomorrow. Unfortunately, this does end the government's business as of today, due to the Rules and Procedures of this House.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as a result of that, for tomorrow we will sit from the hours of 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. We will start with the daily routine, followed by Oral Questions Put By Members, and then we will go into Committee of the Whole House on Bill No. 37.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already spoken with the House Leaders for both Opposition Parties. I wish to advise the House that the traditional lock-up for the budget will take place at 9:30 a.m., and if the House is still debating in Committee of the Whole House it will continue to do so during that process. If debate is ongoing, later in the day we will revert to Government Business and do Resolution No. 800 at 2:15 p.m., so basically we will suspend Committee of the Whole House in order to do that. At that point the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board will table her budget.</p>
<p>Following her Budget Address and the beginning of the reply from the Leader of the Official Opposition to the budget, following his remarks we will return to debate in Committee of the Whole House on Bill No. 37. Again, the House would be sitting tomorrow, Thursday, April 3<sup>rd</sup>, from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. I would so move that, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>
