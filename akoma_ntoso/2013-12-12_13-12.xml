          <heading>TIR: COBEQUID PASS - MAINTENANCE/SNOW CLEARING</heading>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie">
            <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Premier. The Cobequid Pass is a vital transportation link connecting Nova Scotians. It is, of course, a toll road that was introduced by a previous Liberal Government. This year is only December 12<sup>th</sup> and already the pass has been closed twice this season. I'd like to ask the Deputy Premier, will the government review maintenance and snow clearing on the Cobequid Pass to determine why it is so easily closed?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>I thank the Leader of the Official Opposition for the question. There is no question that there have been a number of issues with the Cobequid Pass, as the member and all members of the House are well aware. The reality is it's a very tough area for winter conditions. It gets pounded with sleet and snow all the time and it's very difficult to keep the roads clear in certain weather conditions, which of course we can't control. As the member would know, there have been a number of major incidents there that have led the department to do a number of reviews and studies to try to figure out how we increase support there for commuters and make sure that we keep Nova Scotians safe.</p>
<p>We spent additional resources with plowing. We've done some additional salting, of course. We've had some great participation with the RCMP, who is our partner in road safety, so that has been important. We are also endeavouring to do as much as we can with signage. There are electronic signs at either end of the pass to let commuters know that they may be clogged down and stopped, so that it may be a better idea to turn around, and there are also turning lanes for that. We really do get that and it's a very troubling issue for us and I can say, sincerely, that we are doing our very best to keep the Cobequid Pass open in the winter months, thanks.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie">
            <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
            <p>Last week a mere four inches of snow led to another closure on the Cobequid Pass. It was the second one in a week where the previous week a four tractor trailer pileup caused the multi-hour closure of the Cobequid Pass, and I'll table the details of both closures for the minister. Mr. Speaker, will the department review road safety rules and regulations on the Cobequid Pass to ensure that they are adequate to protect the travelling public and keep the Pass open, safely, in the wintertime?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>What the member is referring to is a number of large transport vehicles that were caught in the Pass. Essentially there is a very dangerous area, probably the worst stretch of the Cobequid Pass that gets, again, bogged down with snow and sleet and all the weather that comes in the winter. What happens is the trucks can't get the speed. There are large, broad, long hills and these vehicles can't the required speed to get up these hills; they get caught halfway and then, obviously, that wreaks havoc on all commuters who are on that road.</p>
<p>Again, it's important for road safety. We do our very best to get the messaging out. I get the member's point about how quickly this happens. The reality is that our crews are hard-working. They do their very best to identify the systems that move into the Cobequid area, and they work very diligently to get them plowed and salted.</p>
<p>To the member's question directly, we have undertaken a review of the Cobequid Pass area, but by all means, it's never too late or never off the table to take another look. I would welcome any suggestions from the Official Opposition. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. I do agree with the minister, there are very hard-working crews in both Londonderry and Oxford that look after the Cobequid Pass, and they do a great job.</p>
<p>One concern that does come up is whether there is sufficient road-clearing equipment to keep the Pass open, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Speaker : when one lane of the Cobequid Pass closes - for example, because a tractor-trailer has blocked it because of an accident - it is very important that there be adequate equipment to keep the remaining lanes open so traffic can continue to flow. In addition, when the Cobequid Pass is threatened with closure, it's important that we have equipment to keep alternative routes, like Highway No. 4 through the Wentworth Valley, open for traffic that can be diverted through the Valley.</p>
<p>It is a concern in Cumberland County that there is not enough equipment to make sure that we have the alternate routes to the Pass available to travellers when the Pass itself is closed, or to keep at least one lane open when another lane is blocked because of a tractor-trailer or some other vehicle that has been stopped.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share that with the minister. I do remind the House that it's important for Cumberland County, but this is a vital transportation link for all Nova Scotians who are coming and going from our province.</p>
<p>I will ask the minister, Mr. Speaker, will the minister agree to review the supply of road-clearing equipment, including their current placement in Londonderry and in Oxford, to ensure that there is sufficient equipment available to keep the Cobequid Pass open and safe?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we obviously rely on the professional advice from the staff that we have in all regions of Nova Scotia, certainly in that area of Londonderry and Oxford. The regional managers are constantly updating us with the conditions and the situations in the Cobequid Pass.</p>
<p>The obvious assumption for a department and for a government and for all members of the House is that we have adequate equipment. Any time there is switching and transferring of equipment, it would obviously be based on the need not requiring additional equipment in those areas. So if this is an issue of simply having more equipment in that area, there's absolutely no reason why we wouldn't review that.</p>
<p>I would certainly commit to having a review with my regional managers, with the MLA for the area, and with all TIR stakeholders. The Cobequid Pass is important for commuters and it's important economically, and we want to keep it open and safe as often as we can, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>My question to the Deputy Premier is whether or not the government has had any contact with the federal government since this was announced yesterday, and what is the official position of Nova Scotia with respect to this plan?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the Opposition. This was just announced yesterday, and I can say that we've had discussions among our caucus and are very concerned about the impact this will have, particularly on seniors and people living with disabilities.</p>
<p>We know that the mail service is an important link for them, for both receiving funds and for maintaining contact with family and friends. We are concerned about the impact, and we will be having further discussions. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the answer. We also learned yesterday with this announcement that approximately 8,000 Canada Post workers will be losing employment over the next five years. This will have a real impact on job loss in Nova Scotia. These are good-paying full-time jobs, which this province relies on. We've already taken a hit in the last number of years with the reduction in employment in federal government agencies in Atlantic Canada, and Nova Scotia taking a disproportionate share of that hit.</p>
<p>My question to the Deputy Premier is, does the province yet have any idea of how many jobs will actually be lost in the Province of Nova Scotia as a result of this decision? And what would the government do to mitigate and assist these workers?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we appreciate that question. I'm glad that the issue of employment was raised because that is one of our main concerns with this change in policy. There are many postal workers in this province, and while providing an important service, they also provide a lot to our economies. These jobs are quite well-paid jobs and certainly will be missed if they are phased out in our cities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we've been looking at the impact of that. It's premature to have numbers yet. As I say, this issue is very recent. I did hear that Canada Post is intending to do a lot of it over time. It's not going to be an immediate thing and there will be attrition, because I believe their average age is something like 47 years of age, so there'll be more people coming up to retirement very soon.</p>
<p>We'll need to look at how those job losses are going to be felt and over what period of time.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#maureen.macdonald"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the Deputy Premier for her response. Seniors' organizations are already speaking out fairly forcefully about the impact this will have, particularly on the seniors population. In fact I heard a representative of a very large seniors' organization talk about how this will make it tougher for some seniors to stay in their own homes. The isolation that people experience as seniors is often broken by that contact through door-to-door mail delivery, where they are able to keep in contact with family and friends.</p>
<p>I'm wondering, Mr. Speaker, can the Deputy Premier tell us whether or not her government will be in conversation, and how soon they will be in conversation, with seniors' organizations that are hoping there is an opportunity to speak with the federal agency and the federal government in terms of moving away from a plan that will negatively impact seniors?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#diana.whalen"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this will be an issue for our discussions with seniors' groups. I know that the Minister of Health and Wellness, who is also the Minister of Seniors, will be including that in those discussions because this is an issue that will hit many people hard here in urban areas, not just in HRM but in other urban areas in our province. So we certainly will have that on our agenda.</p>
<p>I appreciate the question today because it highlights the importance of this. I would point out that just in recent years, our citizens who live in rural Nova Scotia have already felt these cuts to service, and that this has been an issue that would have been around for the last four years, as well, about rural service. I know that many members here would relate to that, because your people are already losing service from door-to-door delivery.</p>
<p>This extension of their cuts is something that we will definitely be talking to seniors about and trying to mitigate.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the honourable Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. The fate of Highland Consolidated Middle School in Westville is an issue that directly affects more than 200 families and dozens of staff living in Pictou East, but it also indirectly affects all the residents of the Town of Westville and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>As the minister may be aware, the junior high students of Highland Consolidated have been moved into the W.A. MacLeod Elementary School building in Riverton for more than a year. During this time, the Highland Consolidated building has been left sitting empty.</p>
<p>My question today for the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development is, has her department made any decisions as to what to do with the Highland Consolidated Middle School building?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#karen.casey">
            <from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, thank you to the member for the question. I'm very familiar with Highland Consolidated and the move of the students out of that school into W.A. MacLeod which, of course, caused that to become a P to 8 school. The school board and school community have recognized that the facilities in W.A. MacLeod are not adequate to accommodate a junior high population, and so there has been a request from the school board to the department to consider renovations to W.A. MacLeod to accommodate that junior high population. I know the study committee is currently working in the community and I would encourage the member to ensure that his concerns get to that study group, either through the SAC or some other way so that they have that information, those concerns regarding the junior high population, which at this time is currently housed in a P to 8 facility.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her comments and would recognize that I have been to all the community meetings. I also met with the staff and students at that school and toured it on different times. The issue for me is, while the building sits empty, school goes on. Currently, the middle school students are housed in the upper level of an elementary school, and these facilities are not age-appropriate for these Grade 7 and Grade 8 students. The school board has applied to the province for $3.5 million to additions and alterations funding to make the existing building more suitable.</p>
<p>The Chignecto-Central Regional School Board has listed the Highland/MacLeod situation as its top priority on its capital construction list. My question today for the minister is, has the minister decided whether her department will approve the funds necessary to upgrade the W.A. MacLeod school, and when can the board expect to receive confirmation of approval of the project?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#karen.casey">
            <from>MS. CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, as the member would know, the request comes from the school board to the department. We are currently working on our capital plan for the next school year. We expect that there will be a release of a capital plan before the end of this calendar year, and any capital projects that we have will be there. But I'm fully aware of the request. I understand the importance it has to the students to make sure that they have an appropriate setting, in particular for the junior high students, and that request from the board to the department has been received and is being reviewed and considered.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her thoughtful, thorough answer there. I know the staff will be relieved to know that they'll be receiving an answer before the end of the calendar year. So the community is looking for a permanent solution, but they do recognize that this will take time. The students of Highland Consolidated have been unfairly disadvantaged because they have not had access to the same standard of education facilities as those students at other middle schools.</p>
<p>The minister may be aware there is a similar possible situation developing at Frank H. MacDonald Elementary School and with the East Pictou Middle School. The East Pictou Middle School is also facing closure and the students there could be moved to the Frank H. MacDonald Elementary School. The parents in that part of my constituency are obviously worried about what may happen there and whether their kids may get caught in the same transitional disadvantage as the students at Highland Consolidated.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, what would the minister say to the parents and families of the current students at Highland Consolidated Middle School? But also, has the department learned anything from that experience that I can give assurance to the residents in the other part of the constituency that this won't happen at the Frank H. MacDonald Elementary School?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#karen.casey">
            <from>MS. CASEY</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, when there was a request that went out from the former minister to ask boards to discontinue their school review process, the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board was one of the ones that chose to move forward with a couple of their projects, recognizing that a delay would seriously impact on the students' education program. Both schools that have been mentioned by the member were part of that process, so I think that should tell the member that the school board and the department both recognize that appropriate facilities for our students for academic programming are a priority.</p>

As he would be aware, and this member may be aware, I tried to get repeated meetings with the previous government over this very issue. Mr. Boyles asked for the meeting to be held in Halifax so that the Minister of Health and Wellness and the Minister of Environment could be in attendance at that meeting, as well as departmental staff. That is happening within, I think it's the first two weeks of January. I've already been out personally to see Mr. Boyles and see there. I have stacks of pictures. I've seen the evidence, and this is a high priority. We've also raised the issue with Nova Scotia Power already and asked them to present us with a plan to address these issues.</p>

(Interruptions) Can the minister explain what he's doing to correct the misleading information that the Leader of the Official Opposition has been saying about the food services at Capital District Health Authority?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, if the Leader of the Official Opposition may like to answer some of that question. It is the season of sharing, so why not? (Interruptions)</p>
<p>It is an issue that is very much being challenged on many fronts, and I know Capital District is looking at food services in a general way, as well as the Tim Hortons outlets. We are at a point in time where we have to look at cost efficiencies right across the health delivery and that is part of what we'll be doing as we prepare the next budget.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Progressive Conservatives try to pretend that this issue is about corporate welfare. This issue is really about the dedicated women and men who provide a core service in our hospitals, a core service to our patients, our patients' families, and hospital workers. These hospitals are places where families gather to support those who have fallen ill - that's who this is issue is really about.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Official Opposition believes that you can get French fries at the cafeteria at the hospital. That's completely wrong, Mr. Speaker, and that's the misleading information that they are providing in their comments about this issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, given the minister's comments in Question Period yesterday, does he agree with the Leader of the Official Opposition that this issue is about corporate welfare?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the workers we're talking about here are an important component of the health care team at Capital Health. Their current pay scale for this group of employees is actually $14.80 to $15.42 an hour. Once an employee in this pay range surrenders their deductions, their benefits, and taxes and EI, they're making about $10 an hour take-home pay. That might be excessive for the Progressive Conservative Party, but I believe that it is a challenge to raise any family on $10 an hour. (Interruptions)</p>

          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is to the honourable Minister of Community Services. In The Annapolis County Spectator yesterday there was a heart-wrenching story about a woman who finds herself living in a dark trailer without a heat source or food - her power has been cut off and she cannot afford to catch up on her bills.</p>
<p>There's another 3 per cent power increase coming in January, so, Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the minister, what is her department doing to help the increasing number of people who are having their income assistance swallowed up by skyrocketing power rates?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#joanne.bernard"><from>HON. JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>I thank the honourable member for the question. It's an issue that is all across this province, including those in my own riding.</p>
<p>Since coming on as the Minister of Community Services, I have endeavoured to take on a very comprehensive review of all the programs, so that the money that is available to the department is going for the best investment in helping people live not only in their daily lives in the short-term, but effectively if they want to remove themselves from the income assistance system to be able to do that, so supports are there for them to do that.</p>
<p>I understand it is very challenging. I have lived those challenges for nine years, as a single mother on income assistance. I know what it's like to go to a food bank; I know what it's like to have difficulties in paying utility bills. We are absolutely evaluating those programs so that we can help people like this constituent.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in 2011 Feed Nova Scotia reported that there was a shocking 59 per cent increase in the number of families needing assistance from a food bank in the Annapolis Valley/Yarmouth region since 2008. According to data compiled by the Annapolis Valley Health, about 47 per cent of the people in Valley communities are earning less than $20,000 per year.</p>
<p>My question again to the minister is, what does the minister have to say to the shocking number of families and the people who are being forced to go to food banks?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#joanne.bernard"><from>MS. BERNARD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm well aware of the rates that food banks are going up. That's certainly a volunteer sector organization that you don't want to see succeed, in terms of people going to food banks.</p>
<p>Unique situations happen in rural areas. People in rural areas are taxed with different problems, in terms of what their daily and their monthly budget might be. A lot of it has to do with transportation, their ability to get to social services, and their ability to find a job.</p>
<p>As I said previously, we are in the very beginning of looking at all of the investments within the income assistance and really trying to transform that system over the next couple of years, to meet the needs on a more here-and-now basis for people living in poverty.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#eddie.orrell"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what is most alarming is that 4,100 people in the Annapolis Valley lost their job in the last year, that's like every person in Berwick and Middleton losing a job. This government has released a plan to create jobs and although it sounds like it, it doesn't give anything to give families for relief on their power bills.</p>
<p>My question again to the minister is, will the minister sit down with the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism to come up with a plan to get people back to work and get them to get their own relief from power bills?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#joanne.bernard"><from>MS. BERNARD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we talk about this every time we meet in Cabinet. It is an issue. We all know that our departments are inter-related and how it depends on what's going on in one department into another.</p>
<p>In terms of energy bills, we are dedicated and committed to removing the energy efficiency tax off power bills so that power bills will go down in the interim. I know that my colleague, the Minister of Energy, is working very diligently to ensure that Nova Scotia ratepayers have the best opportunity for stabilization of rates in the coming years, with Muskrat Falls.</p>
<p>We all know that the work we do is inter-related; we talk to each other every day about that. They know the pressures I have within my department in trying to meet the needs of the most vulnerable Nova Scotians. We're all on the same page for that, I would say that everybody in this Chamber is on the same page for that so that's what will happen in the coming months.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse"><from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Seniors. The Liberals promised a 1 per cent cut, which results in $44 million per year to almost every single government department, including the Department of Seniors. In Nova Scotia we have about 1,000 Nova Scotians turning 65 years of age each month. In fact, the number of seniors in Nova Scotia is expected to double by 2026.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, does the minister think it makes sense to be cutting funding from the seniors' budget when more and more seniors actually need government help?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I can assure the member opposite that when our Continuing Care Strategy comes out and how much it will further embrace seniors and looking after them, she will see that the $28 million being cut across departments won't have any effect on seniors.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse">
            <from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from>
            <p>Thank you to the minister for that. I'm very glad to know that there will be no budget cuts that affect seniors in Nova Scotia. While going door to door, however, seniors I talked to were actually pleased about the fact that there was a commitment to financially assist seniors with hearing aids that couldn't afford those hearing aids, and it's a big problem throughout the province. Can the minister tell low-income seniors in Nova Scotia whether or not they will be able to purchase hearing aids with the help of the program that was promised?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">
            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, what I can tell the member opposite is that the details of what we will be doing around seniors' programs for the future will definitely have to wait until we're into a new budget year. There was no allotment put forward for this year, and all those programs we'll be taking a look at, and some cost analysis of whether it is possible to do.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#denise.peterson.rafuse"><from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Thank you very much, minister. I certainly hope that that answer didn't mean no, because my understanding is that during the election, the candidates for the Liberals had told people throughout the province that they were going to keep with commitments that were coming forth from the government. I would like to also talk about the fact that hearing properly is so important to seniors, for them to be able to participate more fully in society and interact with their loved ones, their families. So it certainly does enhance their quality of life. And also, not being able to hear properly is a health and safety issue.</p>
<p>So I'd like to ask the minister, will the minister ensure that his government stands up for low-income seniors just like they have been doing for Nova Scotian senators?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#leo.glavine">

          <heading>TIR: DOUBLE CHIP SEAL - EFFECTIVENESS</heading>
          <speech by="#tim.houston">
            <from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from>
            <p>My question this afternoon is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Mr. Speaker, under the NDP's road strategy, we saw a significant increase in the amount of roads chip sealed and double chip sealed. Today I want to talk about double chip sealing. If you live in rural Nova Scotia, you now know that double chip sealing means that your road is going to be de-paved; they are going to pulverize your payment and turn it into double chip sealed road, which is essentially a gravel road. The NDP felt that double chip sealing roads was better than patching them. My question for the minister this morning is, does he agree that double chip sealing is an effective tool and will the minister continue to use it aggressively?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>This is something that has been an important topic for us as we look at the capital plan moving forward and how we're going to accomplish looking after the roads for Nova Scotians. Obviously we do our very best with the large-scale capital projects that we have for highways as well as the local roads, and again, we're trying to accomplish as much as we can with, obviously, a limited budget.</p>
<p>With the chip seal, I think, there is a function for it and I think there is a value. There is a combination of things: single chip seal, double chip seal, of course the patching that goes on within the department. To answer the question very honestly and frankly, I rely on the experts who are in my department. I ask the questions about what's the most economical and what increases, or at least maintains, the health of the road. I rely on them. I know that they are doing a good job for our department and for the people of Nova Scotia. I will take their suggestions, and I will follow the plan that they put forth.</p>
<p>As of right now, we'll use a combination of tools to make sure that we do as many roads as possible in the upcoming season. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. I do agree that there may be applications for double chip sealing in the process, but I'm just curious about how those decisions are made. I mean, essentially, if you bought a house on a paved road in rural Nova Scotia, you might now be living on a gravel road, and that has disappointed a lot of residents in my constituency. I'm thinking in particular of the residents of the Marsh Road in Thorburn. The Marsh Road was scheduled to be paved in 2014, but instead, interestingly, was double chip sealed just before the writ dropped. So I know that there are many variables that come into play in deciding whether a road should be chip sealed or double chip sealed, and presumably it's things like traffic volume and the number of houses on a road.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, can he share information on how the department will make these decisions going forward? Because people who live on these roads really don't want to go backwards and now live on a gravel road.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. You know, the reality is, again, that we're doing our very best to keep roads as healthy and as stable as possible. There are a number of categories for roads, whether or not, in what year they were built originally and what maintenance was performed. The member is absolutely correct, there's a formula. A lot of it has to do with the amount of traffic in those areas, number of homes and whatnot, but I can say to the member that I would certainly be willing to meet with him about this specific road.</p>
<p>I don't know the details of why it would be originally paved and then double chip sealed. I honestly don't have that information. So if the member would like to speak about this, by all means we're available. I'm sure he hears from the residents and we would like to hear their concerns. We don't want damages to vehicles because of a certain process we're using, and we want the best roads possible. So if the department has deemed that this is one that we have to look at, then let's look at it. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. Now, in terms of roads that have already been double chip sealed, I can tell you that a couple of weeks ago we started getting a number of calls into our constituency office about the slippery condition of these roads. This is even really before we started the winter season. So there's a big issue developing in that double chip sealed roads can't be salted. They have to be sanded, and sand is only loaded into the trucks after all the roads have been salted. So you can imagine how this really diminishes the winter service level of the people who live on double chip sealed roads. It impacts their lives.</p>
<p>So my question for the minister is, now that there are less paved roads and more double chip sealed roads - so less to be salted and more to be sanded - will the minister instruct his department to look at the allocation of trucks to salt versus trucks to sand and possibly even equip rural Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Department offices, such as the MacLellan's Brook depot - surely we have to show some love to the MacLellan's Brook depot - with access to additional trucks, so that they're able to get sand to those necessary roads quicker instead of those people waiting until the end of the line?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it may be a conflict of interest for me to look at that road, so I don't know if I could do that. (Laughter)</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I think what the member is bringing forth is a very important question. We're sort of in the early stages with respect to the amount of double chip sealing we do in the province. So certainly if there are safety issues and there's a balance, or a question between salt and sand, then look, that's something that the department has to consider. I mean obviously we're talking about vehicles, we're talking about commuters, so the paramount issue for us is keeping Nova Scotians safe while they travel the roads.</p>
<p>So if there's an issue, I will certainly endeavour to talk to my department immediately about this, with some of these safety issues with respect to the double chip seal. If we're making roads that are unsafe, then we've got to obviously take measures. We can't be price-sensitive to the safety of Nova Scotians, so we'll definitely look at that and I can let the member know.</p></speech>

          <heading>ERDT - SOUND STAGE: DEPT. - INVESTIGATION</heading>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that the film and television industry of Nova Scotia is a very important part of our creative economy and needs our continuing support to remain healthy and vibrant. We once had a fine sound studio in Halifax, the Electropolis, where interior scenes for numerous films and TV series were shot - including in fact one, Lexx, which was a very popular TV series which this member had an opportunity to perform in. Many film companies from outside the province were also attracted to shooting here in Nova Scotia so they could have the benefit of using a sound stage, as well as our beautiful environment; also, film crews could work in Halifax without a long trek outside the city.</p>
<p>When this facility was sold, Mr. Speaker, nothing replaced it, and without it Nova Scotia will lose some major opportunities for big-budget films with their high-paying jobs for locals, and lucrative economic spinoffs. My question for the minister is, can he please tell me where his department is in the process of looking into a new sound stage for this important industry, and whether he is willing to invest in a new sound stage to help build the creative economy of Nova Scotia?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#michel.p.samson"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>I thank the member for the question; I know she has a personal interest in this. The fact is that Nova Scotians can be very proud that we have a vibrant film industry, and with the support of our Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, through the generous tax credits that are made available for the film industry, we will continue to work very closely with them in addressing the needs, whether it be a sound studio or some of the other challenges that they face.</p>
<p>The fact is that there are a number of productions currently being done here in Nova Scotia, and we have truly made ourselves into a province where filmmakers and TV documentaries want to come and do business here in Nova Scotia.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the answer from the minister. In Law Amendments Committee on December 10<sup>th</sup> when union presenters came to discuss changes to the Trade Union Act, I asked Gary Vermeer - the President of IATSE, the union representing Nova Scotia's film crews - other than leaving this bill unamended, what do you think the film and TV industry needs most in Nova Scotia in order to grow and thrive? Mr. Vermeer's answer, a sound stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, would the minister agree to meeting with me and representatives from the film and TV sector sometime in January to discuss this important issue?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#michel.p.samson">
            <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we take it as very important to meet with all of our stakeholders. Allow me to say that I'd be more than happy to meet with the member and any other stakeholders in helping to grow the film industry and to grow the economy of Nova Scotia.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, through you to the minister, thank you, and I look forward to our tea and chat.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this time my question is for the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. Artists of all mediums, and the creative industries as a whole, contribute millions to Nova Scotia's economy and, I would say, an immeasurable amount of value to the health and happiness of all people no matter what their socio-economic situation. Under our last government, while we worked hard to get back to balance, arts, culture and heritage were deemed as already cut to the bone after the previous Progressive Conservative Government had also gutted the sector's arm's-length Arts Council.</p>
<p>We recognized the importance of arts and culture in this province in the past by re-establishing the Arts Council and committing to keeping the funding the same and, in fact, doubling the amount of money to the new Arts Council, so will this minister commit to the members of this House, and to the hard-working artists across Nova Scotia, many of whom struggle to live above the poverty line, to protect arts and culture by not cutting any funding to artists' programs?</p></speech>

            <p>Thank you for that question, and I am grateful for the question from the honourable member.

We are looking at the cultural end of the arts community, and I will assure the member across the floor that we are looking and really considering anything that has to do with arts and the culture.</p>

          <speech by="#brendan.o.maguire">
            <from>MR. BRENDAN MAGUIRE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. As long as I can remember, Club Road in Harrietsfield in Halifax Atlantic has been a dumping ground for public waste. In previous discussions with the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal, there has been a commitment to begin a cleanup. My question to the minister is, can the minister please provide an update on this cleanup?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#geoff.maclellan"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>I thank the member for the question. This is an issue that the member has brought forth to me personally, and as he has mentioned, it has been an issue for the department for a number of years. First and foremost, we are committed to a cleanup right away. The Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal staff that are in the area are going to use their opportunities when there is a little bit of a break in the winter services that we provide for Nova Scotians to clean up this Club Road, so that's happening right away and we'll be on that immediately.</p>
<p>The bigger problem though, Mr. Speaker, for this road and for the residents and the people who are in that area, is the fact that it's widespread and large-scale illegal dumping. So you're talking about things like furniture and appliances, and it's pretty hard to believe that in 2013 we're still enduring littering and illegal dumping of that nature. That's a problem for us. We're looking at ways for surveillance, to see how we can monitor this area. We've got to find violators and make sure that we spread the message, that in Nova Scotia and in our society, it is no longer acceptable to dump things illegally. So we are going to clean up and we are going to get that done.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I have a question on the Affordable Living Tax Credit for the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. Cost of living increases in the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security for a senior couple can push them over the $30,000 threshold and result in a clawback of this benefit. Will the minister index the threshold to eliminate the clawback to maintain the spirit for which this tax credit was created?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that question as Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. To the honourable member's point about the Affordable Living Tax Credit, that will be looked at in the comprehensive tax review that we're undertaking. I think the members of the House are aware that we'll be looking at not only taxes, but fees and regulations as well. It's a large project, and it will be undertaken beginning in January. We're going to be getting that underway. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I thank the minister for the response. It is positive. This issue was brought to me by a couple in my constituency, and I have no doubt that members from all across the province have constituents who are affected by this. It was created and built into a past budget model. Good fiscal management should make it part of the upcoming Spring budget at the amount it was originally intended for. Will the minister give us some indication as to how serious she is about this specific matter and having it resolved?</p>

          <speech by="#diana.whalen">
            <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, it is a concern to us; 50 per cent of Nova Scotians fit into the lowest tax bracket, actual taxable income in the lowest tax bracket, so we're aware of the fiscal pressures and the difficulty of people trying very hard to work hard and have a decent life here in Nova Scotia. Certainly measures to alleviate poverty are important to us, and they actually cross jurisdictions, they cross different departments. We'll be working collectively to try to build the best possible plan for the coming year.</p>

            <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the NDP introduced this tax credit when they introduced their HST tax increase, and I'm hoping - and I think many Nova Scotians are hoping - that we're going to see a change with this government in that they will look at the high taxes that we are paying in this province and address that for people. It's making life less affordable. One final question for the minister, can the minister give us some hope that this government will be different from the previous government come the Spring budget?</p>

Nova Scotia has some of the most beautiful beaches and provincial parks in the country. These natural surroundings provide excellent opportunities for camping, hiking, beachcombing, photography, and simply enjoying nature. However, I am concerned to see many of our beaches in our province eroding.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, if the minister hasn't already, will he commit to finding the time to review the legislative mandate of the Provincial Parks Act, which includes the provision for a variety of outdoor recreation areas?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. ZACH CHURCHILL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the member for the question. The erosion of our beaches is a continual concern for staff in our department. Our department works continuously to identify risk areas and to work with those affected communities to ensure that they have been well informed of what the risks are, especially if there is anything that can relate to flooding. Our department will continue to do that. If there are any specific lands that are in question, I'd be happy to hear what they are from the member.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#patrick.dunn"><from>MR. DUNN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Natural Resources Strategy for Nova Scotia, for the period 2011-2020, entitled <i>The Path We Share</i>, lists one of the goals as protection of natural and cultural heritage. One of the most beautiful beaches in the province is located 15 minutes outside New Glasgow along the Northumberland Strait. Melmerby Beach continues to erode, and due to a lack of maintenance, sand continues to blow over the dunes. We are in danger of losing this beach.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. My question to the minister is, will the minister commit to providing the necessary funding, within the Spring budget, to help alleviate the erosion that is occurring at provincial beaches?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#patrick.dunn"><from>MR.

Thousands of loyal visitors are worried about the future of this provincial park beach.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, maybe I needed to provide a little bit more clarity there. One of the areas that seniors now feel a great need to speak often about is their health and wellness issues. So when I'm talking about moving the Department of Seniors, it is having the department actually within the Department of Health and Wellness so that we can have greater lines of communication, greater opportunities for them to be able to raise their urgent needs as well as long-term planning for continuing care. So in actuality, the Group of IX, the department will have a greater voice and greater opportunity to present their needs to the minister.</p>

          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move Bill No. 1 for third reading.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, let me just leave it at this - I know that the members of the Opposition have indicated they have something to say on this bill, so let me just say I'm very pleased by the report out of McInnes Cooper recently, actually just last week, that noted that this will be a transformational bill in the electricity market in Nova Scotia and have significant benefits, in the report that they released just the other day.</p>
<p>I'm also pleased by the editorial in the New Glasgow News the other day which also noted that this is an extremely important first step for Nova Scotia and, in fact, takes some long overdue and much-needed steps.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the members of the Opposition will get involved in the review of the electricity marketplace coming in the near future. I will also finally say that I am pleased that the department is also preparing an analysis of the three bills that the Opposition brought forward this session, and we will be providing it for them because I think they should be aware of some of the unintended consequences that were in their bills that may - in fact, two of them would result in significant rate increases almost immediately.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm looking forward to providing that to them so that hopefully we can incorporate some of those ideas - because there were some good ideas in those bills - into the review that we are taking forward, and actually some of the other items that were in their bills are things that we had already put in the review before they tabled them, and so we're excited about having their input. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#christopher.a.dentremont"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'll speak for just a few moments, and I want to thank the minister for those very short remarks. I know that was really hard for him.</p>
<p>So my quick comments are just simply this - I mean this is the government's break-the-monopoly bill. They went through a whole election talking about breaking the monopoly and, quite honestly, I think what it does is it complicates the system far more than they intended. It is a very complicated matter and one I think that maybe they should have taken a little more thought and a little more work as it rolled around. But we do have the bill before us and we do have an issue looming that it doesn't fix, which is the 3 per cent increase that we are going to be getting in January regardless of anything that government has done. So we'll be monitoring that one over the next bit.</p>
<p>The issue of renewable producers - if they are actually capable or available to provide energy to the retail market will be an interesting one to see. The second piece of that one is whether or not Nova Scotia Power, in their capability of transmitting that energy to our households, will do it at a premium or not - what kind of transfer fees will be included in that one.</p>
<p>And, finally, the issue of when there is no renewable energy to be purchased, as a homeowner or as a business owner, at what rate are you going to be purchasing it from Nova Scotia Power directly? Are they going to be giving it to you at the blended rate or are they going to be giving it to you at something higher than that because you are not buying power from them regularly?</p>
<p>So those are a number of pitfalls that we do see within this bill and one that we hope the government will find ways to get around, as time goes on. Mr. Speaker, again, this was one we don't necessarily agree with, as it rolls around, and of course we will be voting against this bill. Thank you very much for the opportunity.</p></speech>

KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>I was honoured to speak about this bill a couple of weeks ago and I just want to say we all live in a beautiful province and it is really our responsibility to maintain that. This bill will definitely ensure that Nova Scotia is being responsible to its citizens, which we definitely always should be. With fracking comes waste water. If Nova Scotia isn't ready for fracking then we aren't ready to process waste water. I want to say that our caucus has taken a very clear position on hydraulic fracturing from the very beginning. We will not support fracking in this province unless there is scientific proof that it will not endanger our groundwater. Our caucus supports the moratorium on fracking and will maintain that support until we are shown scientific evidence.</p>
<p>We look forward to reviewing the Wheeler Report when it comes out in the Spring and as long as the moratorium remains in place, we believe that we should not allow the importation of fracking waste by-products from other provinces. I just want to let you know that we have reaffirmed our stand on Bill No. 5. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#chuck.porter"><from>MR. CHUCK PORTER</from><p>I, too, just want to take a moment - having lived, and still do live, in an area where we have seen waste water disposed of and we all know in this province we do not have the mechanism to have this waste water safely disposed of in any way, shape or form. This was something that was done in the past, a couple of years ago. For those of you who don't know, it was put into the Avon River. Of course that stirred up a lot of people and still tests were done and you can be doing tests for years because you really don't know what this all takes in.</p>
<p>It is important that this bill goes through and I know that my caucus and I, as has already been said, are happy to support it because there is a long, long, long way to go as far as we're concerned. We'd love to see things move forward. If there is technology, someday, that allows it to be done safely then perhaps it can be considered but we also have to be aware that anything that affects our groundwater in this province or in this country - anywhere for that matter - jeopardizes where we live and we just can't have that, Mr. Speaker. I'm very happy to add my comments to this and to support this bill. I look forward and am glad to see it going through quite speedily today. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I, too, am pleased to see this bill come forward, although as I did mention in the Law Amendments Committee the other day, it doesn't address the issue of transporting this hazardous waste material from place to place within Nova Scotia. It only addresses it coming in from outside of the province. So the same problems can occur if it's being transported by trucks or whatever, or even by trains, within the province. I think we need to pay attention to that and I would hope that the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Energy are both paying careful attention to this as well.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Speaker, there's an energy company that has been granted permits to drill two test wells for natural gas in Pictou County, along the Foord coal seam near Stellarton. Drill sites need to pump large quantities of water from coal seams. This water is known as formation water. Formation water has been found to contain high levels of chlorides, arsenic, barium, and even radioactive materials or NORMs.</p>
<p>There is a Lafarge cement plant near my constituency, in Brookfield, which is looking for approval from the Department of Environment for a pilot project to use fracking waste water that is currently stored in Debert for the making of cement in their kiln. They are obviously going to have to get that waste water from Debert to Brookfield so, in fact, this is still part of the problem. I would think that, in reaching a decision on the proposal from Lafarge on using this fracking waste water, that the ministers will all consult and perhaps hold a public forum in Brookfield about this issue. Those are my comments on this bill, but I approve of the bill otherwise.</p></speech>

This was a campaign commitment made by the Premier and our government to ensure better transparency for Nova Scotians in being able to see from the comfort of their own home exactly how their tax dollars are being invested by our government in efforts to create jobs and grow the economy.</p>
<p>Clearly this is something that will provide better transparency and allow Nova Scotians to ask questions on this. Not only will the deals be put on the Web site for Nova Scotians to access but as well, any amendments that are brought forward to myself, as minister, will also be provided on this Web site and hopefully give Nova Scotians better assurances that their money is being invested in a proper and transparent fashion.</p>

          <speech by="#tim.houston"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to offer a few brief comments on this bill. This is a bill that doesn't address the real problem of corporate bailouts. Nova Scotians that I talk to are disappointed that the government has skirted around the issue, and I disagree with the minister, because it doesn't meet the campaign promises of the government.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians want to see better spending decisions made on the front end with their money, and providing Nova Scotians with a Web site that they can visit and learn about bad deals after they are already done doesn't really speak to the issue. Nova Scotians deserve better decisions with their money, and Nova Scotians deserve new ideas in government. It's certainly not a novel idea to take information and put it on a Web site. Greater transparency into a failed system still leaves you with a failed system.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is just another example where this government said that they would fix a problem, but once elected they have not. We have seen it with energy rates, and now we're seeing it with corporate bailouts. Nevertheless, I am still optimistic that at some point this government will find the courage to tackle head on some of the problems that Nova Scotia faces. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#michel.p.samson"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Pictou East for his comments. When the member said it is not a novel idea to put this type of information on a Web site, I would just remind him that we're the only Canadian jurisdiction that will be doing this. Back home we would call that a novel idea, but again, we're in Cape Breton and you're not, so I guess we have different ways that we look at things. I'm sure my colleagues in your caucus from Cape Breton would see it that way as well.</p>
<p>Again, we've announced a review of the economic tools that we use. I think the fact that we have the Ivany commission coming forward is something that we're all looking forward to, to find new ways. We remain open to hearing the suggestions coming from the Opposition, and as I mentioned earlier, there are a number of companies within the Opposition members' ridings which are knocking at our door. When we're in the position of having to decide whether to provide support or not, it will be interesting to see whether the members of the Opposition will continue to say we should not assist some of the businesses in their own backyards, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>With that, I would hope, as the member said, that he remains a bit optimistic.

I mean, I'm looking at the Minister of the Public Service Commission to give me questions during this one, so maybe I can ask him a question now, fire them at him.</p>
<p>I'll speak quickly to this bill. The Maritime Link is probably one of the biggest question marks, I think, we've had in this session. I know the minister and the Liberal Opposition of the time spoke against the Maritime Link, spoke many times against it. Sometimes they were a little bit for the construction, but were really uncertain of what it meant to energy costs and what it was going to mean to ratepayers in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I think that that still resonates with Nova Scotians. They don't know what the Maritime Link is going to do for them. Is it going to mean increased power costs over the long term? What is that power going to cost when we get it to our homes, when the project is complete?</p>
<p>I know during some questions that we did ask the minister some time ago - or maybe even during second reading of this - the minister quoted some prices of what power would be from Muskrat Falls as of that day, but we don't know what the total cost of the project is going to be in the end. We're already hearing about cost overruns. We're already hearing about extra issues. Some of these things won't be known until after the project is complete and probably a year down the road. So what does that mean to the project? We all know that as time goes on, every project gets a little more expensive.</p>
<p>This is really to match up with the federal loan guarantee to help them out, but it still comes to the point that when the URB was asked whether it was going to be going forward with the Maritime Link or not, there were eight questions that were put forward by the government. There wasn't a denial of the project or a hey, by the way, we still don't think this project should go forward. It was, well, can you meet these eight items?</p>
<p>The minister says that the eight items were accepted by the URB, but they're sort of contained within the document. So I guess we're going to have to take the minister's word for it, that they are actually all there, that this is a good project for Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We've always said that we think the project itself is a good project. We just feel that the deal is still not right for Nova Scotians. With that, I guess we're going to have to see how it turns out in the end. So with those quick comments I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to the Maritime Link Act.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#david.allan.wilson"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I have a few brief words on this bill. I think Nova Scotians need to recognize that the past government, the current government and then the future government are going to have to pay attention to how we receive and generate power here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to spend three days at the URB hearings, the last hearings. I learned a lot. I think Nova Scotians, if they have the opportunity in the future - especially with something that's so important to all Nova Scotians, and that's energy costs - that they take the opportunity to maybe go down and listen to some of the proceedings. It's important to do, it's important as an elected official, it's important as Nova Scotians to understand where we need to go into the future to try to get a handle on energy costs. We know that for far too long in this province, we've had a dependency on fossil fuels. That source of energy has seen an increase over the last decade that is a result of the power rates we have today.</p>
<p>With this project, the Maritime Link, being approved and hopefully seeing that project land here in Nova Scotia, it will put Nova Scotia in a position that will be part of an energy circuit or loop now, where for far too long this province has been at the end of an extension cord when it comes to how we purchase energy for our residents. I look forward to this project going forward. I believe, when it was first proposed, it was a good project. I believe it is a good project now and our caucus will support the endeavours of this project coming through Nova Scotia, to finally place us in an energy loop and not at the end of an extension cord.</p></speech>

<p>The honourable Minister of Energy.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I have just a few comments to wrap up debate on this. The member for Argyle-Barrington raised the issue that the Liberal caucus was against the project in Opposition. Of course, he knows that is false, and we tabled pages of Hansard by myself and the Leader showing us repeatedly speaking in favour of the project in Opposition. As well, what we raised were the impacts to Nova Scotians in terms of risks. I remember very clearly the issues we brought up. We said what happens if there's an issue with the water management rights? What happens if there's an issue in the Northern Pass or with the northern clays? What happens if the project is delayed?</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, for the first time, as a result of the conditions that we put before the board, which were ultimately rolled into the final agreement, even if those things still happen, and I can stand here and say that I don't know that those things won't happen, but what I do know is that Nova Scotia ratepayers and Nova Scotia taxpayers now bear zero risk as a result of any one of those issues happening.</p>
<p>For example, a question that the previous Premier was unable to answer was, what happens if Newfoundland and Labrador loses the court challenge by Quebec on the water management issue? Well, now we know the answer. Nova Scotians are indemnified by Nalcor and Emera against any risks and it is up to those parties to solve that problem. The risk disappears. Before we did not have a guarantee that surplus energy would be available. We now not only have that guarantee but we know that price will never exceed market prices, which for the first time in Nova Scotia history, for the first time in the years of this deal, we now know that the price paid for that pool of energy will never exceed the market prices, which means that Nova Scotia will not have the highest energy prices in Canada as a result of that.</p>
<p>So, the honourable member is correct. Can we say what that price will be in 20 years? No, but he also can't tell me what the price of coal will be in 20 years. (Interruptions) He can't tell me what that fuel cost will be despite the fact that the federal government has said that those plans need to be rolled out or rolled off line by that (Interruptions).</p></speech>

          <speech by="#andrew.younger"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. He can't tell me what the cost of that fuel will be. I can tell you, though, what the difference in that spread will be and the spread shows that the price will be cheaper than the average generation cost to Nova Scotia, which means despite the fact that - the member opposite says we will still be burning coal for many years to come, that's absolutely true. That's absolutely true, but the fact is the other day, on December 3<sup>rd</sup>, the generation cost of coal was still more expensive than the cost would have been under the Maritime Link surplus power, which means that brings the average price of power down.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, those are the guarantees that we now have. We have guarantees of the maximum price that we will pay for imported or other surplus energy - guarantees. We have a guarantee that the competitive market has created. Those are all things that we did not have before. The former Clerk of the Executive Council for Newfoundland and Labrador wrote a letter to the editor in The Telegram on Tuesday, noting that Nova Scotia - as a result of the work that this government has done over the past few weeks - has a significantly better deal and a stronger deal in place, a deal that protects ratepayers. He only wished that Newfoundland and Labrador could have just as good a deal as Nova Scotia now has, as a result of the changes in the Energy Access Agreement and the decision of the board.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Premier I move third reading of this bill. The amendments to the Executive Council Act and Public Service Act are necessary to establish the new Treasury and Policy Board, and update language in the Act to reflect this change and recent changes to department names and mandates. The majority of these amendments formalize changes we have already announced. The others simply update and align provisions in the two acts. But these are an important step to allow us to move forward and get to the work that Nova Scotians want us to do, so I am pleased that they are moving forward in a timely manner. Thank you.</p>

          <speech by="#jamie.baillie"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to say very briefly that this bill will do nothing to create a single job in the Province of Nova Scotia, when unemployment is one of our biggest problems. In fact, we continue to be concerned that this bill, along with its predecessor NDP bill, puts jobs at risk.</p>
<p>Important employers large and small, whether they are Michelin, Sobeys, or the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents our small businesses - they have all been unanimous in saying that first contract arbitration, at a time when our economy is so weak, is a strike against our province in any form. It is a black mark against our province for those who may wish to invest here, start a business here, or employ Nova Scotians here.</p>
<p>The Liberals joined us in Opposition in opposing it, when the bill was brought in by the NDP. They then indicated they would be prepared to compromise with the NDP on first contract arbitration. Today we see the Liberals doing exactly that, compromising the NDP's bill here in the House.</p>
<p>I will say that at a time when our economy is so weak, when families are struggling, when young people are moving away, every action we take in the House should be to create more jobs not to create fewer jobs, not to put jobs at risk that are already here, not to tell important employers, whether they are the largest in the province or small and growing ones of the future like Egg Studios, that the government is prepared to continue with that risk albeit in a reduced form.</p>
<p>I know that the government is going to say that the presenters who came to this House said that they were okay with the amendments. Let us all just be clear for the record - the record at the Law Amendments Committee shows that the presenters who came representing employers, large and small, said clearly in each case that their preference remains to repeal first contract arbitration altogether, which is exactly the position of the Progressive Conservative caucus. It was before the election, it was during the election, and it remains our position today. This is not a time to have a strike against the province when people look to invest here and employ Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I am disappointed that rather than do the right thing for our economy and repeal the bill altogether, the government has decided to just take a watered-down version of the NDP bill. For that reason, just like we opposed first contract arbitration at this time in the first place, we continue to oppose it today and will be voting accordingly. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I stand in my place today on third reading of this particular bill. I was in the Law Amendments Committee meeting and I heard the people come and give their presentations. In fact, when asked, the gentleman who was representing all of the different businesses, who had concerns when this bill was first brought to the House, said not one of those businesses has actually been affected, not one of those businesses has lost business, not one of them has left the province.</p>
<p>Then he went on to say he was concerned that businesses would not be attracted to come to Nova Scotia, when, in fact, what has shown to be the truth is that in the last four years Nova Scotia is now the number-one province or state in North America to have attracted international business from outside the province to Nova Scotia. I would say that, in fact, the bill, as it was, was doing its job in creating a workplace environment that was good for everybody - for workers, for owners, and also for the unions. (Interruption)</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#lenore.zann"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Also, I just want to say that in the two short months that the Liberal Party has been in government, it has been very difficult to be clear about where they stand when it comes to both business and labour. In fact, just in the Law Amendments Committee the other day, when these businesses came forward to say that they were not happy about the holiday in February and that this was not good for small businesses or medium-size businesses and that they were not consulted - that sends one sign to some of the people in Nova Scotia, yet this particular bill sends another signal to the workers of Nova Scotia that, in fact, business is more important to this government than labour.</p>
<p>As somebody who stands here in my place as the great-great-great-granddaughter of the first union representative in New South Wales, Australia, who started the first federation of coal mine workers, it hurts me to see this kind of behaviour coming from this government. Working people are the backbone of this province, and I think we all need to remember that. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I will take my place.</p></speech>

<p>The honourable Minister of Labour and Advanced Education.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#kelly.regan"><from>HON. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to just make a few remarks in closing. This government listened and acted quickly to restore balance and responsibility to first contract arbitration in Nova Scotia. We're keeping our commitment. It's in everyone's best interest when employers, employees, and unions can resolve their differences through collective bargaining and without labour disruptions.</p>
<p>The legislation passed in 2011 left Nova Scotia with one of the most extreme forms of first contract arbitration in the country. We said we would fix this problem, and that's what we're doing. Unlike the other two Parties, we are not slaves to a rigid ideology; we don't think unions are universally the answer to everything, nor do we think that the unions are universally the Devil, which is what the other two Parties seem to bounce between.</p>
<p>The amendments I introduced last week will remove the time limits on conciliation and eliminate automatic access to first contract arbitration. These changes restore balance to the process and bring Nova Scotia's legislation more in line with what is used by the federal government and numerous other provinces.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the members of the Labour Management Review Committee for their important input. I would note that that particular committee includes representatives from labour and from management from companies that have unions as well. They achieved unanimity on this bill, which I think speaks to the fact that it is balanced and fair. Their feedback, along with what we heard from business owners, the employers' round table, and a prominent labour lawyer has resulted in a better bill for all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, these changes ensure first contract arbitration is a tool of last resort. I now move that we close debate on Bill No. 19.</p></speech>

          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable member for Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank, and you have 39 minutes remaining in your time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#bill.horne"><from>MR. BILL HORNE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'll try to get it a little under the 39; I'm not promising much more.</p>
<p>I look forward to the continuation of my Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne as the MLA for Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank, and when we closed debate two days ago I was just getting into the issues that I had found in my election and what I've heard from some of the community people I talked to - so I would just like to continue with that. Some of you have probably heard some of these. One is the traffic issue - and I'll speak to that very quickly - safety issues of Highway No. 118 and Highway No. 102 in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The issue is safety concerns for potential accidents. My personal involvement in travelling the 100-Series roads in the last few mornings, in the last couple of weeks is the safety issue, the tie-ups in traffic beyond the turnoffs could result in major accidents and concerns for the community. We need to have that recognized as an issue and properly dealt with by TIR.</p>
<p>Also in Beaver Bank, it's not the issue of safety, it is the issue of the number of vehicles on the Beaver Bank Road. There is not an alternative route for those people in that community to use, so they have to contend with traffic tie-ups on a continuous basis, every single day. So TIR has to consider some alternative ways of new roads being built - there was one that was proposed in the 1980s to go from Mount Uniacke to Beaver Bank to Wellington and up to the airport, and that highway needs to be resurrected, so to speak, and brought back in place by TIR.</p>
<p>Another issue in my riding, particularly in Fall River, is the lack of central water due to none being available at the moment. We need to have a look at water issues. It's really an HRM concern, but I have to show, I want to show, and we do need to have central water in place in the Fall River area. We have on the books a couple of projects, a restaurant that would like to go in, but can't because of lack of water. Also, two seniors' homes for adult living are proposed by community members and companies, but they can't get them done because we don't have the water. We have talked to HRM and we've talked to the Halifax Water Commission, an agency for HRM, and they have said they're willing to build them if we have the money. So I will be proposing sometime in the near future possibilities of receiving funding from, I hope, the Government of Nova Scotia to assist residents, schools, recreation centres, and these proposed projects in order to get water that is affordable by the community.</p>
<p>I would also like to talk a little bit about mental health and bullying, specifically bullying resulting in teenage suicides, the need of more attention by our government, and the need for awareness programs to help teenagers being bullied to know who they can turn to, to help parents to recognize this issue, and to be able to receive help and assistance through government experts and school assistance. In my riding alone, parents of a young teenager who committed suicide several years ago have started on an annual basis a one-day conference about mental health and bullying issues. This has been very successful, with a big turnout the last two years. I've attended both and participated in the discussions with a dozen experts on bullying and mental health. Candid discussion concerning this issue has taken place and will continue on a yearly basis. Hearing from MLAs' response to their speeches, mental health and bullying issues are a high priority for government at this time.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just give you a little flavour of some of our communities and some of the things that happened in our community over the years. I'll start with the first area, Waverley. It was founded in 1847. Gold was found in 1866 through to the 20<sup>th</sup> Century and the 1930s. So there were actually three gold rush times. Family names that are important to our community in this area, in Waverley: Allen, Blois, McDonald, Wyse, Smith, Hilchie, Crosby, and Hudson.</p>
<p>One of the major community recreation facilities is Cheema Aquatic Club. It has been deemed the past two years as the national aquatic canoe clubs champions. Cheema has been going on for many years, and it has been very productive of high calibre and Olympic team members.</p>
<p>The second icon in the community is the Shubenacadie Canal system, which goes through the Waverley area and continues on up through the lake system of Lake William, Lake Thomas, Lake Fletcher - which I live on - and Grand Lake, and then down to the Shubenacadie River to the New Minas and Maitland area.</p>
<p>It's very important for us to get this canal system operational. It will be a tremendous tourism program. We hope that we can get support from the provincial government, again, to help the canal system, to open up the locks - there are six locks - at least a portion of it so that we could attract tourism. Tourism is needed in our particular area, and a demonstration project of a timed ship of the day to go through the canal system, at least one or two locks, would be a very good tourism project to attract the cruise ship people that come to Halifax in the summers. I would like people to keep that in mind, and the MLAs, keep that in mind as a project.</p>
<p>Some of the area of Lakeview has been very cognizant of the search and rescue for Halifax Regional Municipality Search and Rescue Association. They have been very prominent and passionate about responding to lost people in the woods. In many cases, they have recovered live people, finding them in the woods and bringing them back. Lakeview is the home of the HRM Search and Rescue.</p>
<p>Windsor Junction was the junction of rail transportation from Windsor, the Valley, bringing in goods and people to Halifax, and also the junction of where the rail from Truro came into Halifax for over 150 years. It was very prominent in that area and hopefully someday we'll be having transportation to metro Halifax from the Fall River area by train. It's something that could be quite successful in helping to reduce the amount of transportation.</p>
<p>Now from Windsor Junction the roads go to Beaver Bank and Kinsac in northern Beaver Bank. Beaver Bank was founded in 1776 by Loyalists from the U.S. Such family names as Barrett, Lively, Grove, Gilby, Margison, West, Campbell, Merrigan, and Lewis - all prominent names in the community of Beaver Bank-Kinsac.</p>
<p>Now I would like to come back a little bit and go from Windsor Junction towards Fall River. Fall River is a community of small business owners, and I'd like to discuss that community, Fall River, and the area business association, FRABA. An association of over 110 members - mostly home businesses - meets regularly every month, creating jobs, doing entrepreneurial skills in the community, and moving small business issues, and promoting local issues like having an annual golf tournament open house to meet the members. This association is chaired by Barb MacLellan, a local lawyer and a great friend to the Fall River area.</p>
<p>Some of the important issues in Beaver Bank are the radar base that's been there for many years, from 1954 to 1962. It also was an RCAF station. It was the home of No. 22 Aircraft and Control Warning Squadron, and is part of NORAD and is an important early warning radar base.</p>
<p>For all of those who enjoy golf, golf can be found in Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank. There are three courses. One is New Ashburn in Windsor Junction, Oakfield Golf and Country Club, and Lost Creek Golf Course in Beaver Bank. Also, we have a number of beautiful parks used extensively by many residents of Nova Scotia, not only in our own community. The Charles McDonald Park, which I happen to be chair of, is quite a recreational park for Cheema for training, for the schools, they use it for their field trials and races. The second and third are two provincial parks, Laurie Park and Oakfield Park on Grand Lake, which is one of the largest lakes within the HRM area. It is, I think, about the third-largest in Nova Scotia. It's about 10 miles long and a mile wide.</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to come to a conclusion, which I seem to have lost. What I really want to say is that it has been a wonderful election. The turnout was good for us. I'd just like to say, at this time, everyone have a happy vacation, have a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year. We'll see everybody in the new year, in the Spring session. Hopefully things will go as well as they have gone in this session. To everybody, thank you very much. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable member for Inverness.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#allan.gerard.macmaster"><from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from><p>Madam Speaker, I rise in response to the Speech from the Throne but my mind today is on the recent designation of, "Royal", for Colaisde Na G&#xE0;idhlig/the Gaelic College. Many people in the Gaelic community are disappointed with this and that it was done without consultation. Now I certainly wish no ill will towards Queen Elizabeth II or the Royal Family. I do know, as well, that especially during times like Remembrance Day, many people in my area sing God Save the Queen. They remember from times in the past when our country fought with other countries in the Commonwealth where we joined together and I respect that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the reason I'm rising to speak is, for me, and I think for a lot of other people, about loyalty to one's people and it's about understanding history and the importance of knowing from where you came. It is also about a small group of people asking to put a title on a school that is causing ill will and conflict.</p>
<p>My question to those people is, why not let people enjoy their heritage and their culture, free of oppressive memories of the past? (Applause) Thank you, members, for the applause. Honestly, Madam Speaker, I cannot sing God Save the Queen. Some people may say well why is that? I will draw attention to the second verse of that song where it talks about:</p>
<p class="hsd_center">May by thy mighty aid</p>
<p class="hsd_center">Victory bring</p>
<p class="hsd_center">May he sedition hush</p>
<p class="hsd_center">And like a torrent rush</p>
<p class="hsd_center">Rebellious Scots to crush</p>
<p class="hsd_center">God Save the King.</p>
<p>For me to sing that song would be an act of treason against my own people and I can't do that.</p>
<p>If I go back in my family tree, I had three members of my family - they were Beatons - my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather and two of his brothers fought at the Battle of Culloden, in 1746.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'm not here to talk at length about war but we can see that language and culture, both in the past and in the present, certainly mean something to some people. One of my colleagues suggested that I deliver this speech in Gaelic and I would love to do that. As much as we smile about that, I think about Gussie Campbell, a man I visited, in the appropriately named community of Gussieville, in Hillsdale, in Judique. Gussie was an old man, really, when I met him. When I was going to university one of the projects I did in Celtic Studies was to visit with a member in the community who could still speak Gaelic, so I visited with Gussie. I'll tell you one of the reasons why I can't deliver this speech in Gaelic today is because there was a concerted effort to stamp out Gaelic. Gussie remembers as a young boy being in school where he was made to feel ashamed of his language and where he was also, in fact - I don't know how serious it was - he described it as being beaten if you were to speak Gaelic.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, that is one of the reasons why I can't deliver a speech in Gaelic today. Now I certainly went to university and I spent some time learning Gaelic and I can speak a little bit of it. It's ironic, I had a message today of all days, when I'm going to give this speech, from a person I used to work with in my office, Rachel Daigle, she's married to a Beaton now. Rachel sent me a little text today and said, Allan, it would be nice if you'd come up to the manor to meet with some of the older people because they are talking about how they would love to be able to converse in Gaelic. Sadly, a lot of those people don't have people to converse with in their native tongue. This is why it is such an emotional issue for me and this is why I want to speak about this here today.</p>
<p>Just a little bit of history so people have an understanding of where this started, we go all the way back to the 1600s with the Statutes of Iona that required Highland Scottish clan chiefs to send their heirs to other parts of the country to be educated in a different language and essentially to be changed, ethnically cleansed. I'm going to read a quote from a piece of legislation that was drawn up by King James VI in First Privy Council; this was in 1616, after the Statutes of Iona, where the influential gentlemen in highland society were brought, they were tricked, were taken prisoner and were only released upon their promise to sign an agreement. It was to promise to follow the Statutes of Iona and I'm going to read something, I'll quote this and I'll be happy to table it. This is from 1616:</p>
<blockquote>"Forasmuch as the King's Majesty, having a special care and regard that the true religion be advanced and established in all parts of this Kingdom, and that all His Majesty's subjects, especially the youth, be exercised and trained up in civility, godliness, knowledge, and learning, that the vulgar English tongue be universally planted, and the Irish language &#x2026;" and I will say for the benefit of the members of the House, Irish language at that time meant Gaelic - " &#x2026; which is one of the chief and principal causes of the continuance of the barbarity and incivility amongst the inhabitants of the Isles and Highlands, may be abolished and removed."</blockquote>
<p>Today when we see a college being named Royal, that just brings back memories of what Royal meant in the past to my people. What happened after they signed the agreement, any man who had an estate, who owned 60 head of cattle or more, was required to send his son, and all his sons, to be educated in the English language. What this did was essentially separated the leadership from the common people and thus began the breaking of the society.</p>
<p>My immigration story comes out of that because if we fast-forward to 1746 and the Battle of Culloden, the fallout in Highland society after that led to the immigration of my people. I know if you've ever travelled to Inverness County, there is a stone house which was built in the 1820s by two MacMasters who came over in 1802. That house still stands; they built it with their hands. What is interesting about it is it is actually not parallel to the road, it's off at an angle because it was built before the road was built. So they walked up the banks of those hills and they created a life for themselves.</p>
<p>I have some other points here, but I know we're getting handy the Lieutenant Governor's arrival. I do want to make one quick point, and this may be of interest to members, we often wonder why we see Highlanders in uniform, say up at the Citadel, because, of course, they were fighting the British not long before that. In a lot of cases they were forced into service and the only alternative was, basically, to starve because things were made so bad for people living on such small pieces of land that there really was no way to have a living and that's why many of them came here.</p>
<p>If we look in North Carolina, in the Cape Fear area, many of the Highlanders there sided with the British - why? Because they saw what happened to them in their homeland and they didn't want it to happen again. They knew that the British were often successful in their war exploits, so they joined the British forces and, of course, they lost in the wars of independence. This is also how history can be confused, and I know for young people it's probably confusing. It was confusing for me when I learned it and I, incidentally, didn't learn it through the education system in this province; I had to learn it outside the education system.</p>
<p>I want to finish up by saying that I want to tell you a couple of quick stories. I was in Atlanta, Georgia, a few years back, and I was at the centre devoted to Martin Luther King. I was struck by a woman there who was obviously overtaken by what she was seeing. We were in a room that showed the cart that pulled his coffin on the day of his funeral. That cart was hauled by two mules, to symbolize his humility. When we think about what he went through and how he was able to live through all of that hate without fighting back, I think that is something very honourable and it's something that I admire.</p>
<p>My point in telling this story is when I looked at the woman who was weeping, I was thinking about how important this moment was for her, and who knows where she was from, she was probably from somewhere in the U.S. and she may have been thinking of relatives of her own who faced hate and lived with it. Thankfully, Madam Speaker, we are moving ahead from days like that.</p>
<p>I know in the world we are also thinking about Nelson Mandela this week. I visited South Africa as well. There are still certainly remnants there of the past but we see that country turning the corner.</p>
<p>My point in my speech today, Madam Speaker, is why don't we let people enjoy their heritage and culture, free of the oppression of the past? I do give this speech in hopes that it helps to provide the government and all members of this Legislature with a clear understanding of this issue. It is not to be sensitive about it but it is to be respectful of it. I think that any one of us, no matter what our cultural background is, can point to some type of persecution in the past.</p>
<p>My goal in this Legislature is to speak to ensure that our young people know about their past and that they have an ability to learn more about it and to live it, so they don't forget about things that have happened. Madam Speaker, I do think that the board of the Gaelic College should revisit their decision. That is certainly for them to do, and it is up to them, but I do think they should revisit the decision and consult with people in the Gaelic community, to see if this is actually something that is desired. With that, I take my place.</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Sydney River-Mira- Louisbourg.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#alfie.macleod"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Madam Speaker, I really wanted to rise and have a moment to say a few words, as we are in the dying moments of this session of the House. First, I want to congratulate His Honour, Lieutenant Governor J.J. Grant, for bringing forward the Speech from the Throne. I also want to acknowledge and say to you congratulations for being chosen as the Deputy Speaker in this wonderful institution, and as well as to our new Speaker and certainly to all the members of this House who have been here for the first time.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to be elected on numerous occasions but it never ceases to amaze me, when I come into this building and look around at the history and the heritage of this building, what it means to the Province of Nova Scotia and the people of Nova Scotia. To be able to be part of that, regardless of what our backgrounds are, regardless of what our beliefs are, we are here to work with the people of the Province of Nova Scotia, for the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. This House is for them.</p>
<p>We may be here representing different Parties but at the end of the day, Madam Speaker, our job is to make sure that the people in the Province of Nova Scotia have a voice that is heard. I firmly believe that everybody who is here - the majority at least - want to get to the same place. I've often said and I'll say it again, sometimes we want to get to Yarmouth, some of us are going down Highway No. 103, some of us are going down Highway No. 102, but at the end of the day, the journey takes us to the same place. That is how I see Party politics in the Province of Nova Scotia, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>I, like most of you here, have seen the boundaries of my constituency changed in the last election. A portion of the area that I had the great pleasure of being a representative for, for a number of years, is now part of the riding of the member for Cape Breton-Richmond. I'll tell you, they are good people and he has a big job to make sure that they are served well. But on the other side of that coin, Madam Speaker, I know he'll work hard to serve that part of the constituency. I was fortunate to pick up a new part of my constituency, an area that I was not familiar with. I had an opportunity, like most people here, to go and meet and talk to and really get to know them, and was fortunate enough to get re-elected again.</p>
<p>Somebody would say this - and I'm sure the newer members and some of the old members have heard this a number of times - why in the world would you ever get in politics? What's wrong with you? Well, Madam Speaker, I've got to tell you, the first time that I got involved in politics, my answer was that I had three reasons. My three reasons that day were my daughter Sandra, my daughter Jessica, and my son Daniel. That's changed now. That's changed. I've got four new reasons - my four grandchildren. It's about them that we actually get involved. It's about what this province can be for those people.</p>
<p>The constituency I live in, I've lived in for the best part of my life. It's on a wonderful island - the number one island in North America. I must add that in: the number one island in North America, number three in the world - and I've finally figured out why it's number three. I'm sure the member from Glace Bay will understand this when I say it. The reason we're number three in the world is one of the judges hasn't made it to Cape Breton yet, but when he does we'll be number one in the world as well. (Applause)</p>
<p>The area that I represent has a number of very interesting places. Louisbourg is a national historic site, the beginning of where a lot of what we know as Canada started. Places like Port Morien, where the first coal mine in North America was, where the first Boy Scout troop in North America was. Places like Main-&#xE0;-Dieu, the world's lobster capital - right there in Main-&#xE0;-Dieu. A little place called Little Lorraine, which next year will be celebrating 300 years in existence. My village that I come from, a little place called Gabarus Lake. Right now we have 42 people that live in my community. Right next door to us is the Village of Gabarus, where there was a major problem with a seawall, and the provincial, municipal, and federal governments came together and helped find a resolve for that problem. In two years, they'll be celebrating 300 years of being a community.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I wanted to get up here was, like most of you, to thank the people who gave me the opportunity to be a part of this fantastic Assembly. Like all of you, there are many people I need to thank. We had over 130 people involved in our campaign, but my campaign manager, he and I became friends a great number of years ago, in 1992, and he's been with me in every political endeavour that I've ever done. He, like so many other people, got involved in a system - the system that we have and we take for granted so many times.</p>
<p>You know, we talk about the poor voter turnout that we see in the Province of Nova Scotia and other areas. Mr. Speaker, I'll never forget that one time I read this book, and it said, do you know that bad politicians are elected by good people who don't vote? Because if people don't take part in the system, then indeed, they never know what exactly they're going to get as a representative.</p>
<p>There are so many things that I would really like to say, but I think the thing that I want to leave the other members of this House with, as we move into the Christmas season - when I first got elected in 1995, in October, two months later my wife was diagnosed with MS. It was a tough day, but you know, Mr. Speaker, we live in a great province and in this province there are many opportunities for someone who has a disease like MS, and there are many other diseases that have affected other families, but we try and we work towards helping the people who have those diseases. My biggest supporter, the person who really makes me do what I do, gives me the ability to do what I do, is my wife Shirley. You can never say that enough about your family because all of what we do, no matter what it is, no matter how we feel, no matter what political Party we belong to, if we forget about family, about why we're really here, then indeed we have failed.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, as we move forward in this season where we celebrate the birth of Christ and we celebrate the things that we take for granted as Nova Scotians and Canadians, I want everyone who is a member of this House, who works in this House, who shares with us our concerns about where we're going, to indeed remember we have to be true to our families. We have to be true to what that means and, at the end of the day, that will make us better members of this House of Assembly, that will make us better legislators, and in the end we will indeed do what is best for the Province of Nova Scotia, working together. (Standing Ovation)</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable Minister of Community Services.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#joanne.bernard"><from>HON. JOANNE BERNARD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm so thrilled to be able to do my Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne - and it has only taken a couple of bottles of alcohol to the House Leader, and some money and a few other things, because it was important to me to do, so I really appreciate this opportunity.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to reply to the Speech from the Throne. That privilege is entirely bestowed upon me by the people of Dartmouth North, whom I proudly represent in this House of Assembly. This diverse community with its many strengths has been the cornerstone of my community work over the past decade, and I am honoured to be their representative in government for the next four years. I have knocked on over 8,000 doors in Dartmouth North and learned about issues unique to the riding, the enduring strength that people face every day when they face those difficult situations, and the pride of community from people who have been raised there, raised their children there, and then contributed to neighbourhoods, and lived in their homes for decades.</p>
<p>I have witnessed the wonderful community and youth engagement work of the Take Action Society, the Dartmouth North Association, Farrell Hall Benevolent Society, the community paper, the Echo, and many other groups and individuals who believe in the place where they live. My riding encompasses the northern shore of Lake Banook, Crichton Park, the older Dartmouth neighbourhoods along Victoria Road, Highfield Park, and all of Burnside Industrial Park.</p>
<p>Every neighbourhood has its challenges, Mr. Speaker, and every neighbourhood has its strengths. Community safety, affordable housing, economic and community development are the priority issues for many people of the riding - they are my priority both as an MLA and as a minister. It is truly an honour to be their MLA and to look forward to the work ahead. My quest for all things political began at the age of eight when I wrote then Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau protesting the seal hunt. He answered my letter, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>My academic path saw me earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science from Mount Saint Vincent University, and then on to Acadia University to earn my Masters. All of this was done as a single mother on income assistance, a pivotal program of the department of which I am now the minister - Community Services.</p>
<p>The program supports an investment. That department chanced on me for nine years, ending 15 years ago, and has contributed to me standing here today delivering these remarks. I know that I wanted to make sure that my caseworker during that time knew that, so on the first day of my job as minister, I called and thanked her. It brought us both to tears.</p>
<p>My work in community development and the non-profit sector is something I'm very proud of. My development of the Marguerite Centre, where women can recover from addictions, remains today a testament to what can be accomplished when a caring group of individuals come together to fill a gap in services to people in need. I led that development for three years and celebrated successes with the women who walked through its doors. For the last nine years my work with Alice Housing and, most notably, as the architect of Healing the Bruises, have fed both my heart and soul. I walk away from this amazing organization with the satisfaction of a job well done and look forward to witnessing its direction with my successor.</p>
<p>My political career began over two years ago when I was nominated as the Liberal candidate in Dartmouth North. It was a responsibility I took very seriously as I worked with the many volunteers in the Party who were committed to my election as their MLA. I extend my sincerest thanks to campaign manager Jim Goddard, official agent Michelle Kelly and the rest of the executive and campaign team including: John Nicholson, Mary Kelly, Doris MacDonald, Vera Errington and many, many others. They all include many old and new friends and family, all of whom gave their time, their money, their expertise on behalf of that and the riding association.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I would like to thank the two people in my life who supported me, protected me and encouraged me to follow my dreams. Deciding to seek elected office is a family affair, with different considerations for each person and their families. My decision came with the added value of knowing I would be running as a candidate who is openly gay. I thank Annette, who you all met here today, my wonderful spouse, who stood beside me on days that were hard, in difficult times which were not hers, and with grace, which truly touched my heart. To my son Taylor, who has always been my biggest and proudest accomplishment in my life, he probably paid the price the most for my ambition to get through school - no money to do fun things, no money for the fun toys; going to the food bank wasn't fun. We were a team and we still are.</p>
<p>The work I have done in the community has always been based on my belief that every person has something to contribute and every person deserves to have a good day. It is personally satisfying to me that I lead a department of professionals who deliver on those beliefs every day, to the best of their ability. Their work is difficult. Their work is rewarding. The work is vital to thousands of Nova Scotians and to them I say thank you. At a time when I needed someone to believe in me, the department was there. You can believe in me to represent, to the best of my ability, your work.</p>
<p>To the Premier, thank you for this privilege and your trust in my abilities and heart. I will not let you down. As I approach the next four years, I do so with the values, beliefs and philosophies instilled in me by my parents, whom I lost too soon. I take my role very seriously, as their only child, to honour their legacy. It guides me in everything that I do. Thank you very much. (Applause)</p></speech>

<p>As you know this is our first session of the Legislature since the election, and I want to commend everybody for the tone in the Legislature, the level of debate, and the work that we've accomplished here in the last few weeks. It has certainly, I think, been an improved tone and we appreciate the co-operation from all sides of the House. Thank you very much. (Applause)</p>
<p>This is also our opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to thank the staff who make it possible for the Legislature to operate so efficiently and to accommodate the needs of the legislation moving through the House, so thank you very much. (Applause)</p>
<p>I would like in particular to mention the staff at Hansard who, I know, work long hours to record everything that has gone on here in the Legislature; the Legislative Library staff, who, again, respond so quickly to our requests; Legislative TV; and certainly, the Clerks who join us here in the House, as well as the Pages who support our work, so a round of applause for all of them would be very much in order. Thank you. (Applause)</p>
<p>Again, we are so lucky to be doing our work in this historic building. For the operation of Province House, we thank Mike Laffin and Peter Theriault, who make sure decorum is maintained throughout Province House. So thank you to Mike.</p>
<p>I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Legislative Counsel, who are often working. We may not see them all the time, but they are working to prepare the bills and bring them forward. Also the Commissionaires, who maintain the security and peace of the House - thank you to the Commissionaires, as well. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as we rise today I want to wish everyone a very happy holiday, a Merry Christmas, safe holidays, and safe travels throughout. We look forward to joining here again to continue the work of the people of Nova Scotia in the new year. But in the meantime, Merry Christmas to everyone.</p>
<p>With that, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House of Assembly, I move that this General Assembly be adjourned to meet again at the call of the Speaker. Thank you.</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Just before I make the motion, I do want to interject a comment. I don't know if it's proper or not, but I too want to extend a very warm thank you to each and every one of the members here, new and experienced alike. It has truly been a pleasure to preside during this First Session of the 62<sup>nd</sup> General Assembly of the Nova Scotia Legislature.</p>
<p>For your co-operation, I thank you all, and I very much look forward to coming back in the Springtime - and of course, getting back to our constituencies to do the good work on behalf of all of our friends, families, and neighbours. I want to extend a very warm holiday greeting to everybody. I wish you safe travels back to your home ridings.</p>
