        <p>Order, please. We will proceed with the daily routine.</p>

      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Order, please.</p>
<p>The subject matter for late debate has been chosen, and the topic reads:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Premier, while in Opposition, called user fee hikes "across the board tax increases," but turned around and hiked 1,400 user fees, and as of today, Nova Scotians are now facing an average of a 6 per cent increase from the Minister of Finance on user fees, further squeezing Nova Scotians and making life even less affordable under the NDP.</p>
<p>This was submitted by the honourable member for Yarmouth.</p>
<p>Before I start the daily routine today, I will look at a Speaker's Ruling.</p>
<p><b>SPEAKERS RULING: </b>Comments by Com. Serv. Min., breach of Law and the custom of the House (Pt. of order by Hon. C. d'Entremont [Hansard p. 126, 03/28/13]) Not a valid point of order.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 28<sup>th</sup>, the honourable member for Argyle rose on a point of order respecting remarks made by the honourable Minister of Community Services on the previous day in answering a question during Question Period.</p>
<p>It was the position of the member for Argyle that the minister had revealed personal information about a client of her department, and that this amounted to a breach of the law and the custom of the House. He went on to give a number of examples of cases in various jurisdictions in which ministers had resigned after having disclosed personal information respecting individuals.</p>
<p>My first consideration is the right of all members of the House to freedom of speech. Members are free to say whatever they wish in the House, subject only to a few restrictions, such as not disparaging the Sovereign or the judiciary or using unparliamentary expressions.</p>
<p>My next consideration is whether a failure to follow what the member for Argyle alleges is a custom respecting ministers is something that falls under my jurisdiction as Speaker of this House.</p>
<p>I have considered this matter very carefully, and have examined a ruling by Speaker Donahoe, made on June 18, 1981, in which he dealt with an allegation that the Minister of Transportation had acted in a manner unbecoming a minister and had broken his oath of office. In considering the issue, Speaker Donahoe referred to the previous ruling by Speakers Lamoureaux and Mitchener of the House of Commons respecting allegations against members.</p>
<p>Speaker Donahoe concluded that there was a distinction between a member's conduct and his or her execution of the duties of a minister. I agree with his conclusion. What a minister does, or fails to do, falls under the area of ministerial responsibility. It is a matter falling under the executive branch.</p>
<p>Speaker Donahoe stated, "If a minister breaches his oath of office as a minister, which I believe has not been established in this case, it is my opinion that it is not a function of this House to discipline the minister for such breach." Speaker Donahoe went on to say that the House was free to express its displeasure with the activities of a minister in various ways by substantive motion, including by a substantive motion of censure but that this was not what had happened.</p>
<p>It is my conclusion, if the member did something she should not have done as a minister - I am certainly not saying that I have found she has - that would be a matter falling under the executive branch and that there is not a valid point of order.</p>
<p>We will begin the daily routine.</p></speech>

<p>Whereas it was in this very Legislature that a charter was granted on March 30, 1900, giving members the right to use the designation of "chartered accountant"; and</p>
<p>Whereas 59 Nova Scotians recently passed their uniform evaluation tests to earn their chartered accountant designation; and</p>
<p>Whereas this significant accomplishment prepares these individuals for challenging professional careers and provides the foundation from which they, like many of their fellow chartered accountants, will give back to their communities and make invaluable contributions to our province;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Nova Scotia Legislature recognize and congratulate these graduates on the hard work they have put forth to earn this prestigious designation and join me in wishing each of them every success in their future endeavours.</p>

<p>This matter clearly falls under the scope of ministerial action. It is also within the administrative responsibilities of government when the minister authorized the regular timeline, and it remains under the authority of the Minister of Energy.</p>

Over the last four years, the energy policies of the NDP government have seen Nova Scotia Power raise their bills by more than 30 per cent.</p>

But I will say this, how can the people of this province trust a government that misled the House of Assembly and all Nova Scotians when it failed to disclose revenue overstatements by $27 million?

How can ratepayers trust this government will protect them against Nova Scotia Power when they have failed at every turn?</p>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians got a rude reminder of the NDP cash grab this weekend when the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation overcharged them on Saturday, March 30<sup>th</sup>, two full days before they were allowed to raise prices. They had one price on the shelves and another price at the cash register.</p>
<p>On top of the HST, on top of the user fee increases, on top of all the other NDP cash grabs, this is very frustrating for Nova Scotians, and unfair. So I will ask the Premier, just how many hands can the NDP put into the pockets of Nova Scotians at the same time?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I understand that on the weekend there was a problem with the computers at the liquor stores where they did overcharge on some products. They made the price adjustments that were supposed to come along later a day earlier than they should have. That meant that on some products, people paid less.</p>
<p>That's not a cash grab. A cash grab would be putting the HST on energy prices right across the province for every family. That's what the Tories did and that's what a cash grab looks like.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier has obviously bought the line of his Crown Corporation - that it was a computer glitch. It's funny how those computer glitches, under the NDP, always cost Nova Scotians more. One can only imagine what would have happened if the glitch had cost them less - it would have been fixed on the spot.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, someone over there decided to let it go and charged Nova Scotians more. This is the same Crown Corporation that, under their direction, tried to put out of business those small, independent, u-vints and home brewing companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact is that Nova Scotians were undercharged - overcharged - again by the NDP. My question is, will the Premier apologize to the people who were overcharged and assure them that they can get their money back?</p></speech>

I think that's the responsibility of NSLC just to simply make their things work appropriately.</p>
<p>He's right, some people were overcharged; some people were undercharged. The liquor commission agreed to refund anyone who was inadvertently overcharged. Mr. Speaker. That's not a cash grab. Putting the HST on home energy of every family, that's a cash grab; putting up Pharmacare fees by $4.5 million, like the former Progressive Conservative Government did, that's a cash grab.</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, raising the HST on virtually every item that people buy by 2 per cent, charging the average Nova Scotian over $1,000 in extra HST under their administration - that is the mother of all cash grabs. Raising 1,400 user fees by 6 per cent when people's incomes are not going up - that is the mother of all cash grabs. And allowing a Crown Corporation under the control of this government to overcharge people - and knowingly do it - and do nothing about it, that also is a cash grab.</p>
<p>So I will ask the Premier, will he conduct a full investigation of what went wrong on Saturday and report back so all Nova Scotians can make up their own minds who the real cash grabber is?</p></speech>

As I pointed out, NSLC noticed the error, they refunded the people who requested refunds. They didn't ask anyone who was undercharged to pay an additional fee. But you know something, the real cash grab would be putting the HST on home energy, it would be raising Pharmacare fees by $4.5 million, and it would be raising an ambulance fee from $100 to $600. That is what the former Progressive Conservative Government did and that is the anatomy of a cash grab.</p>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>The rising cost of power has put a squeeze on Nova Scotia families and Nova Scotia businesses. Businesses have cited high power costs as their main concern in the past few years and the expected increase in rates will continue to add more and more pressure on their bottom line. Meanwhile, Nova Scotia families are struggling with 30 per cent increase over the last four years under the NDP Government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia has consistently had some of the highest power rates in the country so why is the Premier adopting the Nova Scotia Power strategy on rates and abandoning Nova Scotians?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know it has been a long time since the Liberals have been in power but let's just cast our minds back. It was the last Liberal Government that actually created Emera; it's the one that brought forward the legislation to establish it in the first place. It was Liberal Governments in the 1960s and 1970s that established the strategy for Nova Scotia that led us into fossil-fuel burning power generation. It is the mistakes of the past made by former Liberal, and frankly former Progressive Conservative Governments, that have led to the energy situation of today.</p>
<p>When we came in on June 9, 2009 we would have loved to have been able to fix all those problems immediately, the problem is you can't. The fact of the matter is it takes a strategy over a lot of years, and a lot of years to fix the mistakes made by Liberals and Progressive Conservatives.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately it is Nova Scotians who are living under the mistakes of the NDP Government over the last four years. They've caused energy prices to increase 30 per cent. Statistics Canada data shows that under the NDP Government, rates have risen by more than 30 per cent, I might add the largest increase in the entire country. This rapid increase is directly tied to the Premier's inability to stabilize rates. It is quite obvious that his policy hasn't worked.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if the Premier can't tell us how much his multi-billion dollar project will increase power rates, how can Nova Scotians trust any part of his ineffective energy plan?</p></speech>

What they have said is not only will it stabilize energy prices with low increases over the first four years, then after that the actual cost of that energy will decline. This is a good deal.

Two years ago the NDP hiked over 1,400 user fees, and on Thursday we learned that the NDP was hiking the same fees again. Two years ago the NDP hike was 2 per cent on most of those fees and this time it is 5.8 per cent on the same fees. This means that since taking office in 2009, the NDP have hiked government user fees by nearly 8 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question to the minister is, why is the minister hiking user fees again, issuing an additional 6 per cent across-the-board tax grab and further squeezing Nova Scotians?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, no one likes it when prices have to increase, but the reality is that fees have not increased for a number of years, and the costs of delivering those services are going up. In addition, this is a year that this province will move back to a balanced budget - something I'm very proud that we have been able to do - and we've been able to do it without putting tolls on the highway and without turning our schools over to the private sector to build and run, like the P3 schools of the former Liberal Government. In fact, when it comes to user fees, the Liberal Party invented user fees in this province.</p>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, after years and years of demanding that the government of the day show proof to the NDP that these fee hikes in the past were based on cost recovery, suddenly the NDP Government is in control and they've hiked fees twice now, with no shred of evidence that these are actually cost-recovery - no evidence whatsoever.</p>
<p>This means that today running a small business is more expensive, food-handling courses are more expensive (Interruptions) No evidence on any of these, but we know that small business is going to be more expensive to run, and that it's more expensive to get your teacher certification, to get proof of maintenance enforcement fees, to get apprenticeship training. All of these things have raised the cost of raising our families and living in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question is, will the Finance Minister explain to Nova Scotians why she feels that she can hike user fees by 6 per cent this year, while Nova Scotians' average weekly earnings are almost 12 per cent lower than the national average?</p></speech>

            <from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know that the honourable member is very concerned about the conditions under which small businesses operate in the province. That's why this government has reduced the small business tax rate and will reduce it again this year. That reduction has put $78 million into the pockets of small businesses in Nova Scotia, something that I'm very proud of, and so are members of this government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's interesting that the minister would even touch the small business tax rate reduction for this year, given that she also monkeyed around with the threshold so that it is cost-neutral to the government. You're not losing anything, and business is not gaining anything; it's cost-neutral, so it's wonderful. It's no more than a talking point for the chambers of commerce while you maintain not telling them the other part of the equation - which is really duplicity, if you ask me. It's a bit galling that the minister would raise it today.</p>
<p>Today the question is around user fees and how they have not been justified with any evidence that this generally 5.8 per cent increase is actually reflective of the cost of living increases and the cost of delivering those services. That was a principle that the NDP really felt strongly about in Opposition. My question to the minister is, why has the minister abandoned her past principles and why is she issuing yet another NDP tax grab?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, one of the key commitments of this government is to return to a balanced budget. We will fulfill that commitment on Thursday. Fees, and the revenue that is generated from those fees, contribute to good public services in this province.

Now we know that they have reached into the pockets of Nova Scotians raising 1,400 user fees to gain another $11.6 million to throw into the government pot. There are 121 pages of new fee increases, and among those increases are fees for home support, user fees which are going up to $12.10 an hour while the charge for cancelling a home support visit goes up to $59.30 per occurrence. I ask the Premier, have the incomes of seniors who have to pay for these new fees gone up by 6 per cent to match the increase or is this just another NDP cash grab?</p>

Wouldn't it be better if the government actually considered the ability of Nova Scotians to pay for once instead of relying on that old story about consumer prices which they themselves are driving up?</p>

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, last year we returned almost $70 million through the Affordable Living Tax Credit to people who need it the most. We took the HST off of home energy, bringing down energy rates by 10 per cent. Contrast that with what the Progressive Conservatives did when they were in power - they put up ambulance fees, they put up the Pharmacare co-pay, they put in place additional fees for home support services and they have the nerve to point to something like fees going up with the cost of inflation as somehow a cash grab.</p>
<p>No, when it came to experts in cash grabs, in taking money out of the pockets of ordinary Nova Scotians, and particularly in punishing those who are worst off in our society - no, not this government, but the Progressive Conservative Government that thankfully is no more.</p>
<p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, speaking of ambulance fees, something that the Premier spoke against when he was in Opposition, it should be noted that on Page 27 of the 127 pages of fee increases, that his government has approved, are fees for ambulances. Fees for regular ambulance services are going up to $142.30; the fees for residents of long-term care facilities for the use of ambulances are going up to $52.90; the fees for mobility challenged Nova Scotians, those who need transportation help, are going up to $105.80 - unrelated in any way to the ability of Nova Scotians to pay.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, for those who do have to pay those fees, that is a real hardship. I'll ask the Premier, are long-term care residents and mobility challenged Nova Scotians able to absorb another 5.8 per cent increase under his government or is this just another NDP cash grab?</p></speech>

It is this government that has a program for low-income Nova Scotians so that they don't end up paying ambulance fees.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as I've already indicated, I'm very much looking forward to Thursday when we will table a balanced budget in the Province of Nova Scotia, a very important day for our province. It will be a day when this province will be turning and moving forward, turning a page from the mismanagement and the bad financial planning of the previous Progressive Conservative Government and bringing us back to some financial sanity.</p>

WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, back in 2009 the NDP university prepayment meant that the following year they were able to show expenditures at a much lower level than the scheduled MOU would have required. Now, last year the NDP failed to disclose a $27 million overstatement in the estimates and every year the NDP budget shows employment and operational expenditures inflated, to be much higher than the actuals reported later. If the Finance Minister is going to report any payment to universities in a year prior to this coming fiscal year, it will allow them to perpetuate this fiscal fantasy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question is will the minister tell Nova Scotians if there have been any prepayments to universities in this fiscal year?</p></speech>

<p>I know it is driving the members of the Liberal caucus absolutely crazy that this government is going to be able to table a balanced budget, and there won't be these funds that we saw in the last Liberal budget tabled in this province, when they set up that ridiculous fund for health care that exceeded $200 million, off the books, with a payment schedule that would only this year be finalized in terms of returning money to the Province of Nova Scotia. There will be none of that.</p></speech>

The minister may not wish to discuss what's coming in the upcoming budget, but perhaps he will recall sitting across from myself and sitting next to his colleagues, and the motion moved by the member for Lunenburg - and I will table that - which approved the Auditor General's budget request, with no freeze; in fact, an $83,000 increase. The member sat across from us and raised no objections, and he did not vote against it.</p>

<p>The Management Commission had three options to look at, and the NDP caucus made the motion that would prevent cutbacks in that office. The Chair of the Treasury Board had every opportunity to raise any concerns; he raised none. He didn't even say that might be an issue. He did not give the Management Commission the opportunity to discuss the issue. It would seem that just as the minister did not inform Cabinet about a $27 million budget error he knew about last year as Chair of the Treasury Board, he also decided not to inform the Management Commission members that he would not ultimately support the motion moved by his own caucus colleagues.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this government recognizes that children in our school system need the support of school psychologists and speech pathologists. It was very interesting to note that I did go back and look at our supposed wait-list that was reported last week by the member opposite, to find out that this province actually is far ahead of every other province in Canada, that children on a list for an appointment, it takes about six to eight months to access service in this province.</p>

The school board submitted that information last year at the end of June and the survey showed that there were up to 2,000 students waiting for access to school psychologists and speech language pathologists. There were 650 students alone in elementary schools who are waiting for that access.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, people living with autism have been the first to tell us that communication deficits and the need for support by professionals is how you address their initial needs.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Prior to the recent increases in user fees, the biannual cost to renew a licence plate was over $200. So when a Nova Scotian needs a new sticker for their plate they must pay over a $100 each year to be legal. Can the minister tell us what the actual cost is for the sticker, the postage to mail it, and the key strokes needed to update the information in the provincial database?</p>

            <p>As I indicated earlier, nobody likes when prices go up on anything and I'm no different than anyone else; I'm true to my Scottish heritage in that regard. However I do recognize that the cost of providing services, public services, do go up and user fees in the Province of Nova Scotia had not gone up for a couple of years and for that reason we did increase fees. This is a year that the government will be tabling a balanced budget and departments do not have the capacity to absorb increasing costs of providing many of these services, because they have been working very hard to work within the envelope they've been given annually.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I must stand up for my people. I know them to be only the most hospitable of people, and they are not cheap, but the fee to renew a plate, in my mind, is absurd. It leads me to ask the minister the question, are these fees designed to cover the cost of plate renewal in the most affordable way for Nova Scotians, or are they needed to pay for her expensive NDP Government?</p>

Isn't that the job of government, to understand that? Shouldn't government also be figuring out how to deliver services more affordably? That's what we heard from this government.</p>
<p>I'll tell you, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to table a couple of things here. One was a promise not to raise taxes. That was made by the Premier in the television debate during the 2009 election. We know that wasn't held, because we saw the HST increase. We also know we've got a budget coming up here on Thursday, and we know that the Auditor General has poured cold water on this idea that the government was in a structural deficit. Had they been in a structural deficit, they'd still be in it, but we hear we're going to have a balanced budget.</p>
<p>My point is, this government should be doing something to made life affordable for Nova Scotians. My question for the minister, why do you choose an expensive user fee, which is obviously much higher than the cost to mail a sticker to somebody, to deliver the service when you promised your government would offer people more affordable lifestyles?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I will move that Bill No. 1 - An Act to Amend Chapter 25 of the Acts of 2004, the Electricity Act, Respecting the Sale of Renewable Electricity - be read for a second time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, on Friday I introduced our government's first piece of legislation, the Electricity Reform (2013) Act. Our government brought this bill forward because we are committed to improving Nova Scotia's electricity system for the benefit of ratepayers. We are also committed to an electricity market that is rapidly adaptable to changing world conditions, and with this bill we are delivering on our promise to open and improve the electricity market while creating new local investment opportunities for renewable electricity providers.</p>
<p>This legislation will permit greater competition and choice for electricity ratepayers. Independent evidence presented at the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board noted that this type of competition should put downward pressure on rates. We already know that in 2003, when one municipality in Nova Scotia had expected the then-government to legislate this provision, they moved ahead with plans to take advantage of it. At the time, the council of the day had approved investments that would have resulted in economic investments in Guysborough County and elsewhere in rural Nova Scotia and a savings on today's electricity bills for that municipality and thus those property taxpayers.</p>
<p>I've previously discussed that specific example in this Legislature in greater detail, but it points to the fact that that opportunity was lost in 2003 because this legislation was not passed. Had it been passed at the time, there would be the benefits of lower rates for that municipality, trickling down to taxpayers as well as investments and jobs in rural Nova Scotia, which do not exist for those projects today because without the passage of that legislation, those projects died.</p>
<p>The Premier has also said that opening the marketplace for renewable energy to be sold by retailers is an important next step in the evolution of the electricity marketplace. This approach has been recommended since 2003, and on Friday it was actually noted in Newfoundland that such legislation is such a benefit in Nova Scotia, it should be considered in Newfoundland and Labrador as well.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians have told us that they want greater choice in renewable electricity suppliers. We have heard recently from businesses and suppliers who are very interested in this opportunity. For instance, companies like Scotian WindFields and Minas Energy are already out looking at opportunities for how they might serve Nova Scotians with this new opportunity.</p>
<p>The legislation will allow providers of renewable electricity to compete with Nova Scotia Power and sell directly to customers. The bill will also commit us to engage independent expertise and hear from people across the province.</p>
<p>As the market develops, Nova Scotians will have the opportunity to decide who they buy their electricity from. It's a solution that puts Nova Scotia first and gives choice to Nova Scotians. Once the legislation enabling the change is in place, we will quickly start the required consultations on technical aspects of the renewable-to-retail regulations to be in place by Spring 2014 and these will be posted on-line so that there is ability to comment from Opposition Parties and members of the public.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, those regulations will be based upon the regulations developed for the wholesale market opening in the mid-2000s, but will be adapted and expanded. They will give legal authority to key players to draft detailed tariffs and the rules needed to operate the new and more open marketplace in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>It is important to note and to note very clearly that recovering the cost of operating the system to deliver electricity is not new. Every ratepayer in Nova Scotia currently pays these tariffs embedded in their electricity rates. The results of the work by the key players will be subject to full Utility and Review Board examination and approval. Once the new market is open, independent power producers will simply seek out customers on commercial terms and build projects to serve them. They will need to meet all environmental and other approvals, but that's just normal business.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: in the opening of the market, one fundamental principle prevails. New opportunities will not come at the expense of existing ratepayers and suppliers of power to Nova Scotia Power. This is specifically enshrined in the bill; no ratepayers will pay additional costs as a result of this move because somebody leaves the system.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians will have a choice: either stay with Nova Scotia Power or go with an independent supplier who will provide renewable electricity on commercial terms. These measures will ensure that ratepayers and industry are protected.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us. There are many who would like to see this happen overnight and in a recent stakeholder meeting - which was extremely well attended, I might add - the biggest question was, how fast can you get this going? My job is to ensure that this is done right. There have been 13 years to get this started and get it underway and we are moving quickly. In the past week, I have received numerous calls from producers, potential customers and stakeholders who are thrilled to see this measure finally moving forward.</p>
<p>Opening up the retail market for renewables is only one step in the electricity marketplace and the evolution of that marketplace. That brings me to the second part of the bill. Before we take the next steps beyond this, we want to better understand exactly where we want to end up.</p>
<p>The legislation will require us to consult with experts and everyday Nova Scotians on what our options might be and what the challenges and opportunities to each choice are. The legislation lays out areas of consultation, but is also clear that the issues are not limited to those mentioned in the bill. We want to know where Nova Scotians want to be and what their expectations are, so we chart a course for our long-term electricity future that Nova Scotians own and support. We will engage experts, stakeholders and ratepayers to hear their ideas on what is important.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe this frank and transparent approach demonstrates our government's commitment and willingness to involve and listen and engage Nova Scotians in these discussions. It will be the first consultation in 13 years in this province on electricity market transformation, and it's long overdue.</p>
<p>Among the many things we will address is, we will look at emerging technologies and what the risks and opportunities they present are, and what timeline they will likely emerge on. We will look at market trends that are impacting rates, including fossil fuel trends, supply and demand, changing world and national emission requirements, as well as consumer trends and opportunities for energy efficiency and conservation; and we will also look at the opportunities and experiences gained by others so that we can best plan for and manage best practices in electricity generation and transmission.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, we need to understand what others have done and why and, if there is a benefit for us, to take similar approaches. We will end up with an electricity strategy that supports our province's goal for both meeting our environmental obligations but also in the lowest cost possible, as well as one that helps grow the economy, puts the focus on investment, technology, research, and opportunities that result in real benefits to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>We will get there through consulting with people with first-hand knowledge and experience of what's working and what's not. We've seen a lot of reports over the past few years delayed and delayed, and it becomes a bit of fodder for Question Period over the years in terms of, where is that report? This legislation specifically lays out a requirement for me as Minister of Energy to table that report in 14 months and for the consultation to be completed within 12 months.</p>
<p>Before I sit down, I want to remind members that we are committed to full consultation on process and substance. Both the draft terms of reference for the electricity future review and the draft regulations for the retail opening will be available for comment on the Department of Energy Web site once they are ready. We are open to any ideas as well as bills submitted by the Opposition as well as submissions to the process and input on the terms if there are any specifics of how they would like to see the consultations roll forward or any areas of the province where stakeholders, they think we might be missing.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians will have the opportunity to have their say on what will give us stable and reasonable power rates for many years to come. We will look at technology, opportunities for our universities, our workforce development and for Nova Scotians. The review will examine the benefits that come from efficiency, renewable opportunities, and economic development.</p>
<p>Next year promises to be an opportunity for us to discuss how we can improve the system we use to generate and deliver electricity in Nova Scotia and how we can put ratepayers in the driver's seat. We will follow with Nova Scotia's plan for the electricity future of tomorrow. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

This is not actually the first time that I have almost needed to rise on a point of privilege during my three terms of office as representative for Halifax Atlantic but I do hope it will be the last.</p>
<p>My current term has been marked by a series of odd events which have seriously jeopardized my ability to function as a member by threatening significant personal consequences resulting from my position as an elected member. I was grateful for your assistance, Mr. Speaker, when in clear violation of Sections 37(b)(c) and 39(1), the Department of Finance had withheld my subsistence for some six months, refusing to issue payment from funds allocated to be held by the Speaker for the representation of every constituency in this province and insisting that Finance would only issue this to me by directly depositing my so-called indemnity to my personal bank account, something for which I would, of course, be personally and publicly responsible in the event of any error in the department's accounting or depositing practices. Every member of this House who remembers the interventions of the Auditor General in 2009 will understand the potentially disastrous consequences of this.</p>
<p>I was also grateful for your assistance, Mr. Speaker, when I was improperly named as a defendant in a lawsuit by a constituent upset that I would not undertake to have a civil servant fired for "disrespecting him." This appears to have been almost unprecedented in naming an MLA as a defendant although it was brought during the Spring 2011 sitting of the House by a man who referred repeatedly to advice from a family friend who, of all people alive in this province today, should certainly be well aware of the legal status of members of the Assembly.</p>
<p>This was appropriately corrected by the Clerk of the House, appearing in the Supreme Court of the province to have my name struck from the pleadings and I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the support of your office in the matter of this violation of Section 28 of the Act.</p>
<p>Neither have I requested the assistance of the House, Mr. Speaker, when my correspondence on behalf of constituents has been dismissed with the assertion that I am not writing as a member of the Legislature, despite my clear statements that I am also a member of the affected group, something which I could avoid only by not living in my own constituency. For any member to refuse to speak on behalf of their constituents would be to deprive those constituents of representation and the logical consequence would effectively stifle all members who live in their own ridings.</p>
<p>I do, however, rise on a point of privilege now which affects all members of this House now and in future, having given you the written notice required under Section 29(2). It is because for my own safety, as well as for that of every other person who has agreed to serve as a member of this House or may do so in future, I wish to request your guidance and determination on a question which I believe fundamental to the continued survival of an independent legislative body in this province.</p>
<p>I would like to draw your attention to the House of Assembly Act, which constitutes the Legislature, and to request your determination on the significance of Section 33 forward, specifically the jurisdiction of the House as the court of record as constituted there with "&#x2026; all the rights and privileges of a court of record for the purpose of summarily inquiring into and punishing the acts, matters and things herein declared to be violations of this Act."</p>
<p>I am well aware, as should be all members, that by virtue of Section 38(1) of the House of Assembly Act, the Act does not and absolutely should not bar criminal prosecution for criminal acts. But I am not at all clear on what the jurisdiction of the House is if it does not in fact include those acts and offences which are specifically declared to be violations under the Act.</p>
<p>I'm gravely concerned that my service as a member may expose me to the possibility of inadvertently committing offences under the Act which may never be brought to my attention prior to prosecution outside of this House. I would like a clear statement as to the protocol which will be followed in the event of such possibility arising for myself or for any other member of this House. If Section 33(5) of this Act does not protect us from prosecution arising from our activities in this House or before its committees or before you, Mr. Speaker, no matter how inadvertent, then we need to know this outright.</p>
<p>In the absence of certainty on this matter and the assurance that I will not be subject to obstruction, threat, or intimidation in the course of my legislative duties through fear of present or future prosecution, my ability to perform those duties is severely and even terminally impaired.</p>
<p>More, I would submit that the privilege of this House - and the privileges of the citizens of this province, by extension - are breached when any member is subject to such obstruction, threat, or intimidation in that all are deprived of the certainty that the wishes of the citizenry of this province are being fairly and openly presented.</p>
<p>In reference to the House of Commons, whose basic privileges are extended to this House by Section 26 of our Act, Marleau reminds us that a 1974 Special Committee on Rights and Immunities of Members of Parliament reaffirmed that the purpose of privilege was "&#x2026; to allow Members of the House of Commons to carry out their duties as representatives of the electorate without undue interference."</p>
<p>In all of the cases mentioned above, I have been significantly impeded from continuance of my legislative duties. I am not requesting re-examination of these matters which were appropriately disposed of, but I do request that the House reaffirm, as was done in 1989 by the special committee, that a member has the constitutional rights and immunities applicable to that office, and independence in the performance of the activities and functions of that office, free from interference or intimidation.</p>
<p>With the above explanation, if you, Mr. Speaker, find that I have raised a prima facie question of privilege, I shall move the following motion:</p>
<p>Be it resolved that the following questions be referred to you or such body as you see appropriate for determination:</p>
<blockquote>(1) On the appropriate jurisdiction of this House as a court of record, as constituted under the House of Assembly Act;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(2) On the protocol which is to be followed in the event of any allegation that a member has committed an offence under the House of Assembly Act, whether under Section 37 or at any other matter;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(3) Whether the Speaker or the Leader of a recognized Party has an obligation to notify a member when any officer of the House, including the Auditor General under the Auditor General Act, Section 25, of alleged "inappropriate behaviour"; and</blockquote>
<blockquote>(4) Whether the immunities of members in relation to actions taken during their term of office does or does not expire with their term of office, and at what point those immunities expire.</blockquote>
<p>I would like to finish my term of representation, at least, with a clear understanding of my legal status as a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature, and I would hope that every member of this House also will have a similar assurance, now and in future. It will be very difficult indeed for the citizens of this province to get the representation they need if their representatives are unable to be sure of their status within the walls of this precinct.</p>
<p>With that, I will take my seat, and I thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable Leader of the Official Opposition.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I note that this is Bill No. 1, the government's first bill. It should go through the same tests as any test that a government bill goes through and that is: does it actually make life better for Nova Scotians? Does it actually bring their energy bills down? Does it actually make it easier to balance the family budget at the end of the month - or for a small business to pay its bills and focus on getting new customers and hiring more Nova Scotians instead of trying to find the money to pay what are the highest power bills in all of Canada?</p>
<p>We're here in the month of December, it is about to get cold outside - it's already getting cold outside - and too many Nova Scotians are about to see their power rates soar once again. Sadly, too many aren't sure how they're going to pay those bills - too many families, where their salary hasn't gone up, their hourly wages haven't gone up, their pension has not gone up, but their power bills continue to go up - are not sure how they're going to get through this winter.</p>
<p>This House knows, I'm sure, of many examples in our own constituencies. All Nova Scotia saw the example of Arlene MacIntyre of Sydney, a senior on a fixed income, whose power bill has skyrocketed, who can't afford to pay it, who is forced into that awful situation where she actually closes down rooms in her apartment - like the bedroom - and takes towels and stuffs them under the door so she doesn't waste heat in those rooms. She tries to live in her living room and kitchen for the winter because her power bill has become unaffordable.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that is not right, not in my Nova Scotia, not in yours, not in anyone else's.</p>
<p>The test for Bill No. 1 that is before us today, this government's first bill, should actually be will it help people like Arlene MacIntyre and those thousands of other Nova Scotians who can't afford to pay any more. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the answer for this winter and the answer for all time is no, it doesn't actually work, it doesn't actually make our power bills better.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that I believe the government knew that when they came up with this policy, that it was a slogan designed to win an election but not actually to provide relief to Nova Scotians who need it. That is a great shame, Mr. Speaker, because Nova Scotians wanted their political leaders and candidates to actually address the problem, not come up with fancy TV ads and cute slogans. They want to address the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that our power rates are too high. It is not right that as a Nova Scotian you have to pay the highest rates for power in all of Canada - that's the problem. If the minister brought forward a bill that actually made that better, we would be the first ones to stand here and vote for it. But to perpetuate that TV ad, the fancy slogan, that electioneering after the election knowing that it won't bring our power bills down, we can't participate in that.</p>
<p>On our side, we said the same thing before the election as we are saying now, that the answer is to actually change the power market so that bills are affordable again, not to follow through on an empty slogan, but that's what this bill does, Mr. Speaker. All it does is follow through on an empty slogan because our rates won't go down. The minister has admitted as much; certainly in the short-term he said, don't expect your rates to go down. Well you know what, Mr. Speaker? It's cold now and our bills are going up now and people can't afford it now.</p>
<p>There are policies that the government could have brought forward that would have actually helped but instead they bring forward this, knowing that it won't make a difference in our bills in the short term and we believe it won't make a difference in the midterm or the long term either. We know that, Mr. Speaker, because it has been tried in other places, as near as New Brunswick and as far as California and it has failed.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick energy blueprint reviewed their policy where they brought it in 10 years ago and concluded it was an absolute failure. It resulted in higher power bills, of all things, and the end of renewable investment at the same time. It is a double loser for Nova Scotians who want renewable power and who want affordable rates, yet the government insists on going through with this empty plan, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>They sold it to Nova Scotians as being the same as our phone bills, Mr. Speaker, where 10 years ago the phone market, long distance and local, was deregulated and our bills went down. They told Nova Scotians that it's just like your phone bills, they went down, your power bills will go down, it's the same thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's not the same thing. First of all, you can't say it's not deregulation and then use deregulation as an example of why your bills will go down. That was the great charade that was played for Nova Scotians before the election and we're not going to participate in it because there are too many Nova Scotians who actually want to see something for real change.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Liberals in Opposition screamed and screamed about power rates. Maybe it was because they actually wanted to do something about it or maybe it was all an act in Opposition. Well here's the test because now they can do something about our power bills, now they can bring forward policies that actually make them lower and provide real relief but they don't. They stuck to the same empty promise as before the election and unfortunately, we're going to go through another cold winter and we're going to go through many more cold winters to come with a bill, Bill No. 1, that fails that important test of actually making our rights better.</p>
<p>Now I appreciate that the minister says don't expect any relief from this Liberal Government in the short-term - at least he admitted that - but to dangle out the hope that someday in the future there might be some relief, when we know from other places that that did not happen, is not right.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with regret, truly, that I get up with this first bill and call it what it is, when we want to be able to support things that actually make a difference. You know, there might as well be an asterisk on this bill and a big disclaimer that says, not exactly as illustrated - just like on the TV ads, not exactly as illustrated - because they try to sell this sorry policy to Nova Scotians as breaking the monopoly. Well it turns out it's not exactly as illustrated.</p>
<p>After all, Nova Scotia Power is the monopoly that they are talking about. Even after this it still will own 100 per cent of the electricity transmission assets in the province, 100 per cent of the distribution assets in the province. They will have most of the generation, all of the traditional carbon generation, and they're still allowed to own up to half of the wind projects. They could change that. They complained about it in Opposition that even for all those wind projects, Nova Scotia Power is allowed to own half, but does the bill address that? No. So all the transmission, all the distribution, most of the generation, and up to half of the wind projects, Mr. Speaker, that's not breaking the monopoly; that's entrenching the monopoly, that's what they're doing now.</p>
<p>They said one thing before the election and now they're saying something else after the election - that's what Bill No. 1 shows to Nova Scotians - but that's not even the end of the story. The minister says that he knows of some windmill companies that want to set up; I hope that's true, I hope it is. But then they have to find customers and he thinks they will.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, even after they generate electricity from renewable sources like wind, they're going to have to pay a tariff to Nova Scotia Power, not one but two and maybe three, and maybe four. How much will that electricity cost when it gets to our homes after they've paid a transmission tariff to the power company and then after they've paid a distribution tariff on top of that? Then they pay some kind of backup fee to the power company, or somebody, to provide electricity to that sad customer who has to pay so much when the wind isn't blowing because all renewable projects, with a few exceptions, need backup power and Nova Scotia Power is the likely provider and they will have to be paid for that. They might even make more money than they do now under the minister's plan. Now imagine how Nova Scotians are going to feel when they find that out.</p>
<p>Even that's not the end of the story, Mr. Speaker, because clearly the government has not done the math on their own proposal. It's time for them to actually do the arithmetic. On top of the cost of generation, which of course in a private market would have to include some kind of profit, on top of the transmission tariff, on top of the distribution tariff, on top of the backup fee, the minister's bill says that when customers leave the system that those of us who remain cannot pay more.</p>
<p>Well then who does? Because someone has to pay their share of maintaining the existing energy infrastructure and if you're going to tack that bill onto these renewable customers that the government talks about, now we have five charges - five - that they have to pay. This is the arithmetic, this is not a matter of political opinion. This is math.</p>
<p>Now maybe the government thinks there is someone out there who will pay multiples of their current bill - already the highest in Canada - to try to make this work. I hope that whenever renewal projects come forward they find that person, because they are a saint. They are obviously a very wealthy saint as well, because they're the only ones who are going to be able to afford it.</p>
<p>Time after time in Opposition the Liberals asked the NDP, how much will our power cost under your policies, and were frustrated when the NDP couldn't answer that question. That was before the election. Now, after the election, the minister brings forward a bill, and he makes an eloquent speech in introducing it to this House here in Second Reading, but what did he not say was how much that electricity will cost when it gets to our homes. They have the same problem that the NDP had: they don't know the answer. That's because lots of people may say that sounds good, but until someone actually steps forward and finances a project and finds a company or a household to buy that power, it is all a fairy tale. It might have made a good TV ad, but it does not make good electricity policy, not in a province that already pays the highest power rates in all of Canada.</p>
<p>Then the minister says, we're opening up the market. You can open a market on paper - that seems to satisfy the government, if it at least exists on paper - but unless you have real producers and real customers transacting, there's no market. It would be the same as saying you're opening up the market for blacksmiths, which might be true on paper, but there's no one out there trying to get into the blacksmith business. For those who need horseshoes, they're not prepared to pay more than they already pay. It is as backward a policy as if they were applying it to the blacksmith industry.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are actually things that we could be doing to make our electricity market better. One of them is to actually reduce the guaranteed profit - the return on equity of the power company. We in the Official Opposition, the PCs, have a bill on the order paper right now that does this. We argued that this was a good, positive change before the election, and we're prepared to stick with it after the election. In the case of the Liberal Government, they also said that the return on equity - the profit of the power company, that guarantee - was too high before the election. They said it here in this House, and they said it on the campaign trail. It's in their platform that it has to be reduced. Here we are on Bill No. 1, with no talk of that anymore.</p>
<p>I know they're going to say, well, we'll review it. That's what the NDP used to say, and nothing ever changed. We want real change to the way electricity works, to provide real relief to people. That guaranteed profit at 9 per cent, which sticks in the craw of every Nova Scotian who goes out there and works hard under no guarantee to make a buck for themselves, that's a good place to start. That would have been a good Bill No. 1, but we don't have it. Instead, we have this.</p>
<p>I will say as a Progressive Conservative that I like competition, I want competition. We want competition in energy like we want it everywhere else. It is the best way to force companies to be sharp, efficient, and fair in their pricing. Not competition on paper like this bill, but real competition, and there is a way to do it.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Energy Gateway council painted the way by saying that if we work together as an Atlantic market, and if we actually build an Atlantic energy grid, our power bills could go down by almost $1 billion a year as a region. Where is the phone call to his counterparts in the other provinces, saying let's do this because it's better, it actually makes a difference, we could actually change something?</p>
<p>It's not done, Mr. Speaker, until it is in place. Then we can have real progress on energy. It doesn't even require the creation of new energy companies because there's already New Brunswick Power, there's already Nova Scotia Power, there's already Maritime Electric in P.E.I. By creating a regional energy market, we could buy power literally on the hour from the cheapest source available and make them compete against each other.</p>
<p>This is a policy change that works, Mr. Speaker. It's in our energy plan - it's the one we talked about before the election, and it's the one we believe in after the election. That's what Nova Scotians expect.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I can't help but note that in the news today Michelin has completed an agreement with Heritage Gas to use natural gas to fuel their plants. What a great example of something the government could pursue on behalf of all Nova Scotians, to use more of our own natural gas here at home, which is cheaper and cleaner than the way we make electricity now - but there's nothing on that today.</p>
<p>In my own constituency, in the Town of Oxford, Oxford Frozen Foods last year made a multi-million dollar investment to bring gas into the Town of Oxford to heat their plant, to run their plant, because it's greener and cheaper. It makes them more competitive and it saves jobs. And because it saves jobs it is better for the people of Oxford, and because they are bringing that gas pipeline into town every household in Oxford will have a chance to make the conversion, if they choose. That's real competition, Mr. Speaker - not paper competition, but real competition for the energy market in Oxford.</p>
<p>Why not find ways to get natural gas available to more Nova Scotians both in their businesses and their homes, knowing it's cheaper and knowing it's greener? But no, Mr. Speaker, we are stuck with this bill and this policy which failed in New Brunswick, which failed in Ontario, which failed in British Columbia, which failed in California, and now we're going to get stuck with it here - among the other places where it failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I will just conclude my little tour of the government's energy policy here this evening by pointing to one other provision, that after all those years in Opposition, after all their talk about the energy market, after campaigning that they had all the answers, now we have a bill that says the government is going to engage in a consultation with Nova Scotians on what they want in the energy market.</p>
<p>We've been down that road before. We've been down that road before with the previous government, with the NDP, that after they made a lot of promises in their election that they wanted to get out of after the election, like our HST, they engaged in this broad consultation. We all know how that ended up - we ended up with a broken promise and the highest HST in Canada.</p>
<p>Now the Liberals have borrowed a page from the NDP playbook. That orange and red hue is showing up again on energy, that there is actually no real change to the way that our electricity bills look or the way our energy market is going to work. We're going to get a consultation and then they're going to come back and do whatever they want anyway.</p>
<p>If this is all they want, Mr. Speaker, then Nova Scotians are going to be sitting here four years from now, looking at their power bill - still the highest in all of Canada and the government will have to answer for that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the last thing that Nova Scotians expected, when they elected the Liberal Government, on power was that their first bill would be to do more study and create more reports and do more consultation. You know, while they are reporting and studying and consulting, it's still cold outside and there are still families who can't pay their bills and there are still businesses that are struggling to compete because they pay power bills well in excess of their competitors around the country and around the world.</p>
<p>So to come here tonight and introduce Bill No. 1 and say well, actually we might have said that before the election but now we think we'll consult, study, and do some more reports. That is not good enough for all those Nova Scotians who actually want change - not more of the same when it comes to their power bill and that's why we rise in Opposition and refuse to participate in what really is a smoke and mirrors bill that actually does not make a single Nova Scotian better off than the day before. Thank you.</p></speech>

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know that shortly someone from the government side will get up and speak about their record and the events of the last little while and it might even be the Leader of the government, The Premier, himself. Nova Scotians are going to hear the sound of a government virtually patting itself on the back, from Yarmouth to Sydney and all points in between, but I hope they know what a virtual world the Leader of the government and the government is now living in when they break their arm patting themselves on the back like that because whatever they say has to be weighed against the record of the NDP, particularly when it comes to budget matters: the $27 million hole they didn't tell us about just last year; the idea that they think it is grand that they try to raise revenue on the backs of everyday Nova Scotians by raising the HST to the highest in the country, after promising not to; saying they are going to have a paper balance in a few days - four years late from what they promised Nova Scotians; the craziness of tabling a budget in this House that had zero dollars for health equipment, something that made no sense to any single, common sense Nova Scotian. That is the virtual reality that the NDP has created. I'm sure that Nova Scotians are going to hear more of it in a moment.</p>
<p>It can only be matched by the virtual reality of the Liberal Party, who claimed a balanced budget themselves in this House the last time they were in, but they did not count $600 million of new debt on the backs of Nova Scotians. The Liberal Party, who managing their own Party, ran a deficit last year despite transferring money around between accounts in a way that no one yet understands - that is the virtual reality of both the government and the NDP &#x2026;</p></speech>

        <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, was it just me or was there something ironic about the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party talking and nobody being able to hear him?</p>
<p>I'm pleased to rise and join the debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. First of all I'd like to begin this afternoon by thanking His Honour, Lieutenant Governor J.J. Grant for delivering the Speech from the Throne. I would like to note that this was His Honour's first session in the House of Assembly. I would also like to recognize, if I may, Mr. Speaker, and send our support to all members of the Canadian Armed Forces, wherever they are serving, as well as those who are in the reserves. (Applause) Finally, I would like to acknowledge the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Progressive Conservatives for their replies to the Speech from the Throne.</p>
<p>I wanted to begin for a second by acknowledging the people of the riding that I represent in Cole Harbour. I have had the privilege now for more than 15 years - in fact, into my 16<sup>th</sup> year - to represent the good people of Cole Harbour. We are a community that is rich in tradition. The Cole Harbour Heritage Farm is a refuge among suburban and city life that many families in my riding take advantage of. There is the Cole Harbour Parks and Trails Association and the enormous work that they do to ensure that there are appropriate walking trails and facilities for people so that throughout Cole Harbour there is the opportunity for recreation.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I could go on about some of the people who come from Cole Harbour, of course many hockey players, many contributors to volunteer organizations, not just in Cole Harbour, but right across the province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, you would know that in addition to representing Cole Harbour I come from Queens County, I grew up in a little town called Milton, which is outside Liverpool; it is a picturesque part of our great province. I'm pleased to say that much of my family still lives in and around Liverpool; in fact, my sister lives right there in town, and my brother lives in the house that I grew up in on Milton Road West. And, really, that dichotomy that is represented by my experience is common to many people. We grew up in rural communities, and we now live in suburban or urban communities. And this is part of the change that has taken place in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I know you're aware of this, it may be that we are no longer in our home communities, but we have never forgotten the rural roots that we have; we go back often, we care about those rural communities, we want to ensure that they are able to not just survive but to thrive. And we look forward to the years ahead, and may they be prosperous, not just for the City of Halifax but for the beautiful Island of Cape Breton, for the communities of southwest Nova Scotia, and of course for rural communities wherever they are in our province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this government's vision is clear. The government believes in the people of Nova Scotia. We're making decisions today that will help the province compete for new business and for good jobs. We are competing for the kinds of industry that will create new jobs. We, as a government, are seeking to ensure that we are able to provide better care sooner for families from one end of the province to the other. We want to ensure that we treat our seniors with the dignity and respect that they deserve. We want to improve skills training and education. And we want to build a made-in-Atlantic-Canada clean energy solution for future generations.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to report to the members of this House and to all Nova Scotians that our province is starting to turn a corner. The changes that this government has made are helping make life better for families in Nova Scotia today. And we are creating an environment for success into the future.</p>
<p>I want to talk just a little bit about the Better Care Sooner initiative that this government has undertaken. You know, Mr. Speaker, for generations, Nova Scotians were told that the health care crisis in our province was unfixable, that the problem had grown too big. The former governments, both Progressive Conservatives and Liberals said the same thing, that the problem was simply too big and that, in fact, all the provinces, no matter where they were in this great country of ours, were trying to deal with these challenges without success.</p>
<p>The reality for Nova Scotians is that the other Parties, whether they were Progressive Conservatives or Liberals, had simply given up on the public health care system. But, Mr. Speaker, our government said that the right to health care means access to care, emergency care, when and where you need it. Our government refused to accept that there was no answer. And with the help of many, our government created the Collaborative Emergency Centres, or CECs as they have become known. Today, families get the care that they need when and where they need it. Families without a family doctor have access to same-day or next-day medical appointments. By coming together and working on a solution, Nova Scotians made this happen, Madam Speaker. Yet the Leader of the Opposition continues to criticize the CECs, even though other provinces have adopted and embraced the model in their own communities.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'm sure you remember that just last summer I had the opportunity to chair the Council of the Federation, and I brought all the premiers from across the country to this province and many of them took the opportunity to learn about the innovative practices that we were putting into play in the Collaborative Emergency Centres. One of those premiers, the Premier of Saskatchewan, in front of the national press gallery came out and said, you know, we've come here and we've looked at the Collaborative Emergency Centres and we're going to take this home to Saskatchewan because this is a great idea. Actually, I think what he said is that we're going to steal this and we're going to take it home to Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>I remember standing there at that press conference and thinking to myself, here was the Premier of Saskatchewan, a man who was coming from the province where the original principles of public Medicare were first set out, where Tommy Douglas first put in place the fundamental tenets of public health care that much of the country now sees as part of the social fabric of our nation - here was the Premier of Saskatchewan coming to another NDP province to learn about improvement and innovation in health care that will propel those principles first annunciated in Saskatchewan into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want you to know that we were very, very proud, and we are very, very proud of this innovative practice, this advance in Medicare. I would just point out that I believe last week, or the week before last, that the Liberal Government of Prince Edward Island announced that it is adopting the Collaborative Emergency Centres and also will be joining our provinces 811 network.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition said in his reply to this very speech that the "CEC model is just another way of saying that your emergency room is closed." Madam Speaker, the province has opened a Collaborative Emergency Centre in the Opposition Leader's own constituency - and I want to point out to the Leader of the Opposition, and to the member from Kings West, that not only has that stopped the closures - between September 1<sup>st</sup> and October 31, 2012, that emergency centre was closed 60 hours; for the same period this year, how many hours it was closed? Zero.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that this is not an important improvement for the families and the seniors of Annapolis. Madam Speaker, I understand it, the Liberals had their chance to fix health care and their focus, the plan that they brought forward - and I'm sure the member for Clare remembers it very well, he was a part of that government - they brought forward this plan that was heavy with layoffs, a thousand nurses, closing 1,500 hospital beds and pouring more public dollars into a system that was broken.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Liberals decided that what they wanted to do was maintain the status quo and what they did was leave an even greater debt for our children to deal with. Nova Scotians cannot afford a return to the old way of doing things. The status quo is what got this province into the problem that we have, it is what go the province into the rut that we're in. A return to that old way will only put the province back in that same old rut. This province is finally starting to turn a corner, and the next few years will be critical to ensure that Nova Scotians benefit from the opportunities that are coming.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to speak a little bit about the Maritime Link. The Maritime Link is a made-in-Atlantic Canada solution that will provide clean energy at the lowest and fairest price. It will bring hundreds of good jobs and it will be an economic driver in the years to come, yet the Leader of the Opposition can't seem to make up his mind where he stands on this important project or, for that matter, even what his Party's energy policy should be.</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words on Bill No. 1. On Friday I characterized this bill as a bill of, you know, cross our fingers and hope it works, and that's just the issue. Today I heard more of the same from the minister when he talked about broadening issues that are not even contemplated in this bill about other aspects of consultation and so on. The fact of the matter is that previous to the election he and his Party, when they talked about what they were going to do, the buzz was break the monopoly. When we said no, it's deregulation, they flat out said, oh no, it's not deregulation and now they're saying it's deregulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in Bill No. 1 you cannot have it both ways. I mean it's good to have a catchphrase but the reality is deregulation has failed and not just by inches but by miles, not just in the Canadian market but in markets in places like - of all places - California, an interesting state inasmuch as they have such a great amount of wealth and ability to absorb such things. They do manufacturing and agriculture to a much greater extent than the people of this small province but in many ways it mirrors it because it's resource industries and so on and, you know, they are on the brink with the way Enron treated things. Many of us will remember the brownouts and so on.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is not a bill that helps us in any way to find a meaningful resolve to what's happening to Nova Scotian families as it relates to their electricity bill. In Opposition the now governing Liberals had four years and a campaign to really tell us what it was all about, what they were going to do, and if Bill No. 1 is the best they can do, then I would put forward to you that we're very much in trouble because it isn't. I think in terms of if there were local producers out there - and let's get really out there for a second and say that if this bill was to get out there and work its place into the market system, and so we're talking about local entrepreneurs who are involved with helping to produce this clean energy. So they start making money. What happens when Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec comes knocking on the door and says, I want to buy you out? What happens, as the previous speaker said, the idea that we cannot produce at this time and they go back to Nova Scotia Power? How can anyone guarantee those things?</p>
<p>I see the idea of these small local companies. It reminds me of back in the mid-1970s when Canada got involved with opening the market for cable television, and to their credit, what they wanted to do at the time, cable stations would be owned by small local groups from various backgrounds but it would be representative of the community. Now, Mr. Speaker, we see what has happened since then. That market has been basically gobbled up by three or maybe four major players within Canada and if they find that there's a way to make a buck, they're going to gobble up these local people. Any idea that this is to help local groups is, I think, a fallacy at best.</p>
<p>We need an energy plan, but what the minister is saying today is pass Bill No. 1 and if you pass that we are going to go out and we are going to do some more studies; we are going to go out and we're going to talk to Nova Scotians. They didn't talk to Nova Scotians before they brought Bill No. 1 in, they just foisted it on Nova Scotians and said, there you go; this is what you want. It has to be just the thinking of the government because they are saying now, if you pass this bill we are actually going to go out and start talking to people because we haven't talked to them before, so that's what we're going to have to do.</p>
<p>First of all we're going to break the monopoly but we're going to deregulate, but when that catastrophe and that snowball comes bounding down the hill, we're going to start studying, people; we're going talk. We are going to stick to the timelines, but, Mr. Speaker, the timelines will mean nothing to anybody in this province when the issues of this broken bill happen because it will be deregulated. These people will find out they probably have bought power or have contracted with a group for power that may no longer be able to serve their needs. It's deregulated and so what? So by deregulation, if they want to come back then and be a new customer or renew their relationship with Nova Scotia Power, what is left for them? What does Nova Scotia Power do with them?</p>
<p>The government today - or actually, I guess, on Friday is a better way to phrase it - they really don't understand the renewable market. With every breath they could muster and every word they could muster they were certainly against Muskrat Falls and on Friday the URB said no, we are casting aside your eight suggestions and we're moving forward. It is issues like that that say, wow. If the government thinks that the URB took all eight of their suggestions, boy, I am in trouble and all Nova Scotians are in trouble if they took it.</p>
<p>Now I know the Minister of Energy will have the time to close debate on this and if he wants to give his version of how that Grimm's Fairy Tale ends, that's fine. The reality is that's what the board said.</p>
<p>Let's say if their want had come true and Lower Churchill wasn't to happen, where would these upgrades in transmission lines come from? Really, you can't have one without the other. We know that what this province is in desperate need of is an upgrade of their transmission lines. We are in a position - for years, we were an energy taker and so we have really poor transmission lines.</p>
<p>I remember talking to some colleagues at one time at an energy conference in Maine and they were saying that was one of the things through government reinvestment - and at that time President Obama had said to the people in the various parts of the United States, what can we do as a government to invest in infrastructure? Just about every state at that point said look, we need to upgrade our transmission lines because they deteriorated so much over the years, partly because of failed approaches in areas like California, failed areas like Maryland, where people saw their bills go up about 60 per cent because of deregulation.</p>
<p>These weren't small markets like ours, these were markets that were in the middle of the loop; they weren't at the end of the cord, as they say. So we have an issue here as it relates to infrastructure. They were against Churchill Falls that would provide some degree of that transmission infrastructure, so it's kind of perplexing when you put the two together and one doesn't get that they're - pardon the pun - linked.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, you know the idea of putting this bill forward and then saying, well, we don't know when or if we're going to see lower rates for this, because bringing in this bill today you would think that the consultation would have allowed them to say yes. I suppose I'm not as Pollyanna-ish as the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to think that rates can just be pushed down to almost nothing overnight. Well, the reality is the whole power electrical generation system is a big ship to turn around and we appreciate that. I think it's only right that whoever is given charge of that, that it be done in a meaningful time.</p>
<p>The issue here is that there's absolutely no timeline, it's not even like 10 years that we'll have this turned around, not even 20 years. There's just oh, we'll just hope that this is going to work. If this works, that's great. If it doesn't, it's a shrug, a hearty hi-ho Silver, and off you go.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what does Bill No. 1 do, except give you the slogan back: we broke the monopoly? But who does it help? I live a kilometre and a half from the largest generating station in the province, Lingan generating. It's not always the best neighbour, in some ways. We have issues, especially in parts of my constituency that are more downwind from them in the Dominion area, that when they have flare-offs and so on, they have issues with dust and so on.</p>
<p>Here is a plant - now mind you, it was built by Liberals; Liberals ran Nova Scotia Power when they built it. They expropriated land, which is one of the finest recreational swimming areas in the area, but they expropriated it and built it. It burned for years, until the mines were closed. It burned Cape Breton coal. (Interruption) Who closed the mines? We will come to that in another part of this speech, Mr. Speaker. (Laughter)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we've been a power generator before; that is the position that I'm trying to make here. It's nothing new for Nova Scotians to be a power generator and a power exporter. I'm sure that the member who was just prompting me, I can remember the time when there was much upheaval about the oil market, and who stabilized the energy prices for Nova Scotia at that time were the hard-working women and men who mined coal in Cape Breton - mainly men were the active miners, but there were obviously women in the system. That's where it came from, so we're no stranger to generating.</p>
<p>If you look right down the pipe, whether it's Nova Scotia Power or whoever, right next to this large coal plant is a series of about - I think it's up to as much as a dozen wind turbines now, Mr. Speaker, but it's the ability and the overall efficiencies of wind turbines.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think there's a person in this Chamber who is against clean energy - that should go without saying - but what we don't have is how we are going to get these folks who generate energy, and then get it to market in a proper way? The only answer the government has for us today in going forward is, let us do deregulation - a form of which has failed in Ontario, failed in New Brunswick, failed in Alberta, failed in Maryland, failed in California, failed everywhere it's gone. For some reason, keep hoping that it will change. That's just not the case - you just can't keep repeating the problems of the past and hope they're going to change.</p>
<p>In the minister's opening remarks he talked about those things; he talked about being able to take best practices. Wouldn't it have been more prudent to get the best practices on the front end than to start this and find out that the best practices are contrary to your bill? Wouldn't that have made more sense? Rather than to come running up to this Legislature with a bill that fulfills nothing, it just says we've broken the monopoly.</p>
<p>We would be supportive of breaking the monopoly if there were a way you could show it worked. In the body of this bill, there's nothing in here that says it works. It doesn't give anyone lower rates, and it doesn't really give a decent framework of what the real meaning of local is - who are local providers? Do we define local as Atlantic Canada; do we define local as within a county or a district? I'm at a loss with that.</p>
<p>It's a time that we should be seriously looking at this. The government is very high on hyperbole and very low on how to get things done. We have extremely high prices here and &#x2026;</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>Madam Speaker</from><p>In 2008 the Leader of the Opposition called on all political Parties to find an Atlantic Canadian solution and to build an energy corridor right here in Nova Scotia, in partnership with New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador. Up until last year, he fully supported the government's investment in the Maritime Link. Here's what he actually said in this House, :</p>
<blockquote>"We can no longer look at it as solely an issue for Nova Scotians to deal with. We need to begin to engage Atlantic Canadians and Atlantic Governments on the issue of energy security to make sure not only that our energy is secure, but that we have stable energy pricing so that businesses know what the economic environment is that they're working in.</blockquote>
<p>He went on to say, and this is what I find particularly ironic, Madam Speaker, "We will stand beside any Premier or any Party who decides to do that." Now today he is turning his back on our homegrown solution to bring stable energy rates to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>During Question Period, Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and some of the members of the Liberal Party were asking about the cost, the price, and I just wanted to table for your information and for the information of the Liberal caucus, the editorial that appeared in the Halifax ChronicleHerald, where they talk about the price of this energy. It says that: "If imports were raised to this level, (i.e., 30 per cent of usage) they say the blended price for the fixed block and market energy would be eight cents per kilowatt hour."</p>
<p>Imagine what an advantage this would be for Atlantic Canadians. When asked directly about the energy cost for Nova Scotians, the company, in their filing, pointed out that this would be less than a per cent a year for the first five years and then the actual price would start to decline, an enormous advantage for ratepayers, for businesses, for ordinary citizens in our province.</p>
<p>Instead of this, instead of doing what he said he would do, Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues are busily on the phone to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, trying to make a deal. Can you imagine, they are suggesting that it is best to rely on Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec - one of the largest monopolies in the world - to supply Nova Scotia energy needs. It's hard to believe. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I can hear the Opposition members speaking and what they know is simply this - they would give away the integrity of the system to another provincial government. That's what they would like to do. (Interruptions) No, it wasn't 8 per cent. When you voted to put the HST back on home electricity, it went up by 10 per cent; 8 per cent is the initial block of energy that we will receive.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, since my time as Leader there has been one area in particular that I have worked very hard to improve and that is providing better supports for our seniors. Our Party led the charge in Opposition for better, more affordable care for seniors and we continue that fight today. Today seniors represent a generation of people who have worked their entire lives to help build our province. They turned the wheels of the economy, they put down roots here, they raised their families here and, yes, they are the ones who paid the taxes that built the social welfare net that we have today. Yet, under previous governments, both Progressive Conservative and Liberal, seniors were forced to use their savings to pay for long-term care. This created unfair financial hardship for them and their families.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I knew that was wrong, my Party knew it was wrong, and of course Nova Scotians knew it was wrong, and that is why in Opposition we campaigned alongside thousands of Nova Scotians from one end of the province to the other to fix this unfair situation. Today, because of the work of this government, more long-term care beds are being added, more home care services are being significantly expanded, so that our seniors can live their lives with dignity. This government put nurse practitioners and paramedics in long-term care facilities so that seniors can get the care that they need without having to leave their homes.</p>
<p>In the last four years, Madam Speaker, 17,000 low-income Nova Scotians have benefited from not having to pay provincial income tax. That means an average of $450 was put back into the hands of each one of the seniors who needed it most, and all the seniors benefited because we removed the HST off of home energy. It was a simple step that made a real difference for families even though it is one that the Leader of the Opposition called bad, bad public policy. Apparently lower energy rates are bad public policy.</p>

<p>We do have issues about where we're going to go with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and how federal regulations will impact us. Again, that's why we're supportive of green energy; that's why we've been supportive from the get-go in the Lower Churchill - it makes absolute sense. If Bill No. 1 were to really take on and say we're going to build on what transmission lines we're going to get out of Lower Churchill, we would be happy with that. But how can we support a bill that doesn't do anything except break the monopoly and deregulate?</p>
<p>My friend, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, says he's fond of deregulation. It's very seldom that I agree with that member and this won't be one I'll agree with him on either, because in this market it's too small to go and just throw that out and say without a plan, we're just going to deregulate, let's just do a roll of the dice and see what happens. The one thing I will agree with that member on is if the roll of the dice doesn't go out the way the government wants it to go - and there's a better than even shot that it won't - that ratepayer that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party talked about, she'll probably be down to living in one room.</p>
<p>It will be too onerous, if he or she at the end of the day has to go out and shop, wait for the weekly flyers to be dropped off and find out who has the best energy deal this week and where can I get it. Is that what Nova Scotians expect from their government? All of a sudden are we going to start buying our power from Walmart? Mr. Speaker, that's all the more reason why we cannot support this bill. The bill absolutely says nothing, it just says look let us do this, let us deregulate, that's all we want to do.</p>
<p>Now I've heard the minister talk about a few groups that have contacted him, that are excited about it. In my time home on the weekend I haven't heard a consumer that was excited about it, and in fairness it's a fairly complex issue so it's hard to grasp on first blush and so people would want more time for this but that's the reality. In governments, Bill No. 1 is a sort of showcase bill, if you will, Mr. Speaker, to show that this is what we're about. Well if this is the showcase bill of what they're about then they're not about much because the bill is not about much.</p>
<p>I still am intrigued by the minister's "we're going to do these other things" that are not even contemplated in Bill No. 1, they're not contemplated, I think he had the weekend to reflect and realized, whoa is this one a stinker or what. So he has to realize, oh we've got to put some meat on this bone and so there are now all these other consultative processes that he has talked about, all these kind of deadlines that he's going to meet.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's perplexing, I think, to a lot of people why the government rushed this bill to this House and put it in the front window of the store and everyone will be happy with it. For me, this is not a bill that I have a philosophical difference with. It's not like, you know, at least from my perspective, no one's got the argument left to right on it, it's not that kind of political or centrist. It just seems that, my argument with this bill is to come back another day and give me a bill with all that consultative process in it that reflects what Nova Scotians want, which should be in there, what Nova Scotians are willing to pay, what type of energy they want.</p>
<p>Going to back to earlier when we talked about when we burned Nova Scotia - predominantly Cape Breton coal - for our markets. That fit in a time and place, Mr. Speaker. I'm the son of a coal miner and I understood that put food on our table but it's a different world. Many people really don't like the thought of selling or burning fossil fuels, then there is the other side of it is the market for fossil fuels. One year you could be riding high in April and shot down in May, as they say in the song, so that's an issue of some of the problems with fossil fuels, that's life.</p>
<p>We were really hoping that we would have a really good bill here from the new government that we could get behind and support and would allow Nova Scotians to see an energy future, to say, we need a mix of product in our energy system but all it is, is the old mantra of breaking the monopoly and deregulation. There is just nowhere that they can say, yes, at this point we will have lower rates for Nova Scotians. There's just nowhere, so why the rush? Why not do that consultation and make sure that Nova Scotians are getting the best possible rates? Why are we debating an empty bill here today? Is it just for show? There is no substance for ratepayers. Is it just to tweak the nose of Nova Scotia Power? These are questions that will be answered by other people, but the government does what the government does. We realize, as I've often heard, they do have a majority and they will do their darnedest to pass this bill.</p>
<p>Our Party will not be supporting this bill, if you haven't already guessed that, but more importantly I urge Nova Scotians to take time, when this bill clears the hurdle of second reading to get to the Law Amendments Committee, and make sure your voice is heard to protect your stake as a ratepayer, because the government is not. You better get there, because I'm going to tell you, when this bill passes and deregulation comes to Nova Scotia, like it has in New Brunswick, like it has in Ontario, like it has in Alberta, you will be paying higher rates, and it will be thanks to that government. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>
        <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>I'm very pleased in the upcoming budget our most vulnerable seniors will, again, be looked after. More of the province's poorest seniors will be exempt from paying provincial income tax. Starting on January 1, 2014, the number of seniors who will no longer pay provincial income tax will increase to 25,000. (Applause)</p>
<p>Another 4,000 seniors will have a portion of their income tax returned to them - those are 29,000 seniors who will be able to make choices based on what's best for them, not out of fear of not being able to make ends meet.</p>
<p>In addition, Madam Speaker, this year we will increase the maximum property tax rebate that is available to seniors by $200 to $800. This will help 4,000 seniors stay in their own homes and in their own communities longer. Our government and our Party are proud of our support for seniors. For too long, these people have been making choices based on fear rather than on their own need. They were being forced to turn to their families to help take care of them in their retirement. It was the previous Progressive Conservative and Liberal Governments who forced our seniors to undergo a humiliating assessment of their personal finances in order to pay for their own health care.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Nova Scotia is turning the corner. Families, seniors, and young people cannot afford to return to the old way of doing things. Both of the Opposition Parties are out of ideas. Their way of doing things harmed seniors, drove young people out of the province, forced chronic ER closures in rural communities, and put the province on a path to a $1.4 billion deficit.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this week the Minister of Finance will stand in her place and she will introduce a balanced budget. This government said that it had a plan to bring the province back to balance. The past four years have required sacrifice and commitment from Nova Scotians. The credit for getting back to balance belongs to those Nova Scotians. Our province is one of only four in Canada that will table a balanced budget this year, and we will do that while protecting, preserving, and promoting the services families and seniors depend on. This government is working hard today to ensure a better and more sustainable future for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The last Liberal Government was defeated on a promise to improve health care by borrowing $600 million and then claiming that the budget was balanced. The Progressive Conservatives, whose Leader has been trying to claim some higher ground, spent, on average, $277 million a year in unauthorized year-end spending. That is spending that was unauthorized. It was spending that the House never had the opportunity to review. That year-end spending by the previous government added a billion dollars to the debt of this province. I always say that if you want to get out of a hole, you have to stop digging - and that is exactly what our government did.</p>
<p>In 2009, Nova Scotians elected an NDP Government because the status quo wasn't working. They wanted change. They wanted something better for the province. The NDP is delivering that change, and we are working toward preparing for the opportunities that are spread out ahead of us. Nova Scotians want to continue moving our province forward to a better future, for them and for their families, but if it were up to the members opposite, that progress would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians have a choice of the NDP and of the old Parties and the old ways. Nova Scotians could choose New Democrats, who will seize every realistic opportunity. We seize those opportunities for a simple reason: because jobs mean food on the table. It means that a worker is taking home a paycheque to support his family. It means that loved ones can come home from Alberta. It means a better chance for kids and grandkids to grow up here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Or Nova Scotians could turn back to a Party that would simply ignore when opportunity comes knocking. They could choose New Democrats, who would enable them to control their own destiny, building community-based industries while leading Canada and the world in creating a green economy, or Nova Scotians could turn back to a Party that would allow control of our environment to go to the highest bidder, ignoring the global challenge of climate change.</p>
<p>They could choose New Democrats who believe in local food, local energy, and made-in-Canada solutions, who believe that those are a stronger way to build our province and a stronger way to build our country. Nova Scotians could turn back to a Party who would give control of Nova Scotia's energy to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, one of the biggest monopolies in the world. They could choose New Democrats, who are ready to invest in affordable housing, a healthy start in life for every child and a little more dignity for the seniors who worked hard their whole lives to build this province.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians could turn back to a Party that pays lip service to poverty reduction and a better life, or Madam Speaker, they can continue to support New Democrats, who know that the real enemies are poverty, joblessness and despair, who know that we must work with business and labour and everyone else who's ready to move Nova Scotia forward so that there is a better future right here. They could turn back to a Party who sees working people and labour unions as public enemy number one.</p>
<p>I said it before and I'll say it again, Nova Scotia is starting to turn the corner. There is renewed hope and optimism in communities right across the province and it's thanks to the NDP. Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I move adjournment. (Applause)</p></speech>

        <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, an interesting discussion has been going on here tonight. I wonder if when the NDP agree with the PCs, are we sort of in agreement - regardless of our philosophical differences, that we're agreeing? Maybe I should reconsider my position on this one. I'm not too sure what is going on here. (Interruptions) It's strange.</p>
<p>Again, the test that we should put on all pieces of legislation that come before this House of Assembly is whether it is right for Nova Scotians or not. Nova Scotians need to know that their government is standing up for them when it comes to the ever-increasing cost of their power bills. Only a few months ago - a month and a half ago - all of us were knocking on doors and listening to Nova Scotians. I can tell you - not each and every one, but a good majority of those people were talking about their power rates and how they can no longer afford to pay their power bills. They're finding they are getting far too out of their reach. What we see today, again, is something that's not going to make that better. This is a little bit of window dressing when it comes to power rates in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>People shouldn't have to choose between keeping their power on and feeding their families, and that does happen far too much in this province. For some of the new members of this House, maybe you have had it happen already, but there will be lots of constituents coming to your offices with $1,000, $2,000 bills, wondering how the heck they're going to be able to pay for it. Regardless of that, we really don't have answers for them. It's very difficult once your bill gets that far - that they're going to be able to pay them off. They should never have gotten there in the first place. We shouldn't have the highest power rates in the country, and we should be able to help them pay those bills as they come to them.</p>
<p>My esteemed colleague who sits next to me talked about slogans. Really, this is what this bill does: it tries to bring back a slogan. The Liberal Government - the Liberal Opposition of the time - talked about breaking the monopoly, talked about deregulation, which is ironic because the same minister brought a bill in today talking about the NDP slogans of JobsHere and Ships Start Here and all of that stuff, that maybe they should be changing the way governments advertise. Well, that's exactly what this bill is doing, allowing this government to be able to say look, we broke the monopoly.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, we all know that really isn't true because really what happens here is that 95 per cent of the generation, 95 per cent of the transmission, and 95 per cent of the distribution of electricity in the province is still in the hands of Nova Scotia Power. Really nothing has changed there.</p>
<p>If we look at the regulation and we look at the generation of green energy in this province, Nova Scotia probably owns half of those too. So how did that break the monopoly?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the power company will be required to give permission to retail producers to use their lines. I think if you look outside and you look around our communities, no one else really owns the power lines except the power company, except for places like Berwick and little energy producers that have that, the generation themselves. What charge will that infrastructure be required to get the electrons from a power generation to it? What's it going to actually cost?</p>
<p>Let's say the rate is 13 cents, so if the rate is 13 cents, plus, plus, plus - plus, plus, plus is what is going to happen, if they can provide you with an energy rate of 13 cents. We know that green producers are producing for far more than that. I have yet to see a green project that is producing for under that in Nova Scotia at this point.</p>
<p>So there are a few other questions that we need to have answered and maybe the minister will answer them during his wrap-up of this. How will those extra, additional costs impact the ratepayers? He's saying it won't. Well, I need a little more assurance of that.</p>
<p>What will power bills look like? Not only are we going to be paying more for those bills, in our estimation, you're going to have to buy the extra power from someone else. So when those producers are not producing, at what rate are you going to have to buy from Nova Scotia Power? Is it going to be at their regular rate or is there going to be an extra rate because you're only an occasional customer of Nova Scotia Power?</p>
<p>For far too long Nova Scotians have been asking government to stand up for them, to bring their power rates down again. That's what we all heard during this last election. Once again we have a government that cannot guarantee it.</p>
<p>We need to be realistic. This plan did not work in New Brunswick. We heard a whole bunch of other places where it didn't work. It was not economical, did not attract enough interest in it. Power rates have become too serious an issue to be met with just a thin and unpredictable plan. Nova Scotians, of course, deserve much better than that.</p>
<p>Winter is coming, Mr. Speaker. It has been here for a couple of little visits and I'm sure it will come to stay pretty soon. It will present hardships. Another 3 per cent increase is coming in January, folks. I kind of forgot there was a 3 per cent increase promised to Nova Scotia Power during the last increase request. This bill is cold comfort for those Nova Scotians already struggling, and this government should be thinking of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to Bill No. 1, which is, in my estimation, a disappointment for Nova Scotians.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Madam Speaker, I move second reading of Bill No. 3, Support for Parents of Critically Ill or Abducted Children Act.</p>
<p>This legislation will let families focus on what is important during these difficult times. There are children and families not knowing whether they are going to keep or lose their jobs. No family should have to worry about what they are going to do or how they are going to pay their bills, or whether their job is secure and when they are ready to return to work, they will return to work.</p>
<p>I speak as a father and as a grandfather. I can only imagine the heartache facing families who need to take time off work because their child is critically ill or is the victim of a serious crime. It is a terrible situation that I wish no family had to experience, but unfortunately it happens.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians who need time away from work because their child is critically ill or a victim of a serious crime will no longer have to worry about losing their job. This legislation provides protection for families that I hope they will never need, but protection that will mean the world to them if indeed the crisis strikes. Without such a change there is no guarantee that the worker would have a job to return to at the end of such leave.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that this leave was championed by a brave, determined, New Waterford woman, Valerie Loveys, who had the unfortunate situation of living this very experience. Her daughter, Stephanie, died of cancer in 2008. Ms. Loveys has been fighting for this change ever since, so that parents could be with their children and not have to work at such a critical time in their lives. My heart and indeed my respect go out to Ms. Loveys for the ordeal she went through, and my congratulations for ensuring that Canadian parents and families have this time they need when they grieve.</p>
<p>In 2004, the provincial government introduced a compassionate care leave of eight weeks for family members who take time away from work to look after their loved ones, often in the last weeks of their lives. That leave may be too short when a parent or a guardian has to cope with a child's longer-term serious illness or injury. This June the federal Employment Insurance Program is being changed to allow parents and guardians to receive up to 35 weeks of EI benefits if they need to take time off to provide care for a child's critical illness or injury.</p>
<p>This legislation, which falls under the Labour Standards Code, will ensure that parents are allowed 37 weeks of time worked, with protection to return to their jobs at the end of such leave. The 37 weeks includes a new 35 weeks of EI coverage plus the standard two-week waiting period. It will also allow a parent or guardian to have a longer leave if the child dies or disappears due to a criminal act.</p>
<p>Although these cases are rare in Nova Scotia, parents have already had to deal with very painful situations involving the loss of a child. Under the proposed amendments, parents and guardians will be allowed the following: up to 37 weeks off work to care for a critically ill child, up to 104 weeks off work if a child has died as a result of a crime, and up to 52 weeks off work if a child has disappeared as the result of a crime.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia is the first province in Atlantic Canada to extend this protection for families. Again, this legislation provides protection I hope that no family ever has to use. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#980981f9-4823-4d4b-8134-a47d4ecf5405"><from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a privilege to speak on Bill No. 1. Everyone knows there is a reason why Nova Scotians find themselves dealing with high electricity prices. It is because over many years this province has relied on coal and the price of coal has gone up 75 per cent. Why was that reliance? Because there was no planning in terms of our energy and the direction we needed to go.</p>
<p>When the NDP formed government, we knew there needed to be some type of strategy to move forward and we had to be looking at renewable, clean energy. That is why we pursued the opportunity with Muskrat Falls.</p>
<p>There are other reasons besides the coal prices going up by 75 per cent that have created these high electricity prices. Of course, we all know that one of them is the fact that Nova Scotia Power is a private company and was privatized by the former Progressive Conservatives when they were in government. We also know that the Liberals gave Emera the power to be the parent company to Nova Scotia Power, and that has created all the issues around the shareholders and that has created the issues that many in the public perceive as unfair salaries and unfair shareholders' rebates, what they're getting. But that was not created on its own - the Liberals had a hand in that.</p>
<p>When the concept of Nova Scotia being a partner with Muskrat Falls and when it was announced just a couple of years ago, the former Leader of the Official Opposition, now Premier, could not wait to get to Newfoundland and Labrador to stand for photo ops about Muskrat Falls. But, wait, he was in Opposition, so therefore that meant we cannot support this. So the Liberal game began and that was the game that they still play - the game of perception, the game of slogans without any solutions. So they did not see the benefit at that time to support the Maritime Link. They knew the nature of the electricity files, a very complicated one to explain to the general public, so it was easier to take the route of political perception - we will break the monopoly. Boy, that does sound good. Why wouldn't you vote for us, we'll break the monopoly? The perception game over and over again - and they're still playing it.</p>
<p>It plays on people's emotions, you know, the very people we were talking about and we were knocking on doors and everyone here, no matter what Party they represent, I'm sure heard from people, families and seniors, who are finding it so, so difficult to pay for those electricity bills, those electricity bills that are so high because there was no planning years ago leading up to today. There was no planning to look at renewable energy and make a difference, but the Liberals who are now in government say that they had the solution and that solution is that they'll break the monopoly. That solution is let's take credit for Muskrat Falls. Isn't that a flip-flop? I cannot count the number of times I sat over on the other side and heard members of their Party, in Opposition, getting up and standing and saying that Muskrat Falls is not the deal - it's not a good deal.</p>
<p>Well, the Utility and Review Board was where the process took place and it was in the proper place, in the proper hands, and the public, and the Opposition and government, everyone had the opportunity to express their concerns and give their suggestions. That's what the Utility and Review Board took into consideration. It wasn't the Liberal Party who made those changes, as they now claim in the media that they tweaked it. They didn't tweak anything because there was nothing to tweak because of the fact that that information was already provided through the proper consultation process that we have in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>You know, it was only less than, what, not even two months ago that we were knocking on doors and I know that people were thinking that it was the Liberals that had the solution. They were going to come in and they were going to be the saviours of the electricity issues and the high price. They were in high gear telling Nova Scotians that they were going to be the saviours; they were going to break the monopoly. They were going to have Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec as part of it - I don't even hear them talking about Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec at all. It's silent. Before, it was almost every day in this House we were talking about, oh, Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec. One of the questions that we kept asking was how are we going to get Qu&#xE9;bec-Hydro here? Do you think New Brunswick is going to let Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec go through? And once they reached Nova Scotia, whose grid were they going to use? Nova Scotia Power, I believe.</p>
<p>It's the same as this bill. It's all about perception; it's a slogan; there's no meat to it. It's not realistic - you know, they are saying in the bill that they will force Nova Scotia Power to be part of this and allow people to be able to, or companies to, come in and be a part of that grid.</p>
<p>Well, they are a private company - did we forget that? That is no different than going to Michelin and bringing in a bill to tell Michelin that they have to let Goodyear come into their plant and use their equipment to make Goodyear tires. Do you think that Michelin is going to stand for that? I don't think so.</p>
<p>The fact is, this is what we have to be looking at, as the other speakers in Opposition have brought forth to Nova Scotians. Nova Scotians will see this. They're waiting to see their electricity bills go down. What I heard about at the door was electricity. When I ran in 2009, what did I hear at the doors? About electricity. It's a complex issue that takes time. That's what we said, and it's funny that now that's what the Liberals are saying: give us time. Well, I can tell you that many people are not going to give you much time, because they've been told that year over year over year, that we're trying to explain that these things are complex.</p>
<p>I think time is running out. I know you haven't been here very long, but believe me, in the minds of Nova Scotians, time is running out when that electricity bill comes in January or February and then it comes again in March or the late Spring. I don't think your slogan of breaking the monopoly is going to work all the time and in the future.</p>
<p>One thing in closing - the person who actually said it the very best is now the Premier of Nova Scotia. The now-Premier stood in this House and said - to media also - that your past actions are a reflection of your future actions. We know that deregulation has failed in the past in many places throughout the world. That should be an indication of the path that we're on with this electricity bill, and that is failure. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>There has been much talk about how this is going to break the monopoly. We're going to break the monopoly. The question that was asked to me many times on the weekend, we're going to break the monopoly by giving an alternative that actually costs more money than the one we have now. That's really not what people consider to be breaking a monopoly. They think that doesn't give them any choice. The question on people's minds is, what are we going to do about the price of power? The winter is coming, and the costs are going up.</p>
<p>Just in the last three days in our office, we've had a couple of calls from people who are losing their power because they can't afford the bills they already have before we get into the major heating season. The question is, how do we do something now that will really affect the consumers in the Province of Nova Scotia? To say we're going to break a monopoly, that we're going to let private producers go out and produce power, is good - free enterprise is great. But, indeed, that takes time. That is going to take time, and the consumers, the ratepayers, the people who turn on the lights, turn up their heat - they need answers now, not down the road.</p>
<p>There's no talk about how this is going to affect the cost. We need to know more about that. The ratepayers - the Nova Scotians that put all 51 of us here - are asking the question, how am I going to get through the winter? How are we going to survive? There's nothing wrong with the idea of breaking a monopoly, if it were real. In terms of the real world, it's about the cost. We spend money right now on very expensive foreign coal. We heard that time and time again from the former government.</p>
<p>There is a solution. The minister's own department will tell you that coal will be part of the solution for Nova Scotia's electrical production for the next 20 years. Nova Scotia Power will tell you that. We have coal here in this province, better quality coal than we're importing. Maybe this government could look at that, talk to the people who have the ability to produce coal here, create jobs for Nova Scotians, stabilize the price and the quality of the coal, a better quality of coal that gives more BTUs that will create better and more energy at a cheaper price, and less transportation on that very coal. At the same time his department says we're going to be using it.</p>
<p>We all want to see other sources and we need to have other sources of power production, and breaking the monopoly might be one of the ways to go, but it's an immediate problem that needs to be addressed right now, Mr. Speaker, and I don't think this bill, Bill No. 1, is doing that for the people.</p>
<p>These new companies are going to form because they want to make money and that's fair, that's what it's about, but Nova Scotia Power wants to make money too. They're not just going to just say you can put power over my distribution system, you can send power over my lines and I'm not going to want you to pay me for that. That just doesn't happen; that's not how business works. There is a cost and that cost has to be met by somebody and at the end of the day all these costs that we're talking about, Mr. Speaker, they are paid for by the consumer, the people who put us in this House.</p>
<p>So if we're truly worried about the people of the Province of Nova Scotia, if we're truly worried about the ratepayers, we should be looking at the things that we have control over right now, the things that we can do to effect change immediately, not studies that are going to take months to take place, not the construction of wind towers that are going to take months to take place, but look at the system that is there now and how we can correct that system so the people in the Province of Nova Scotia get a better power rate. This bill does not answer the immediate question. We need to have action now, thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise on Bill No. 3, Support for Parents of Critically Ill or Abducted Children Act. I listened to the comments made by the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education, the Government House Leader and the Deputy Premier and it brought to mind an issue as well that I think it would be useful to remind the government of. When the minister spoke about any families having to face a tragedy involving a child, the result of a criminal act, I think it's important that we remind the government as well that it's important that the Minister of Justice and Attorney General ensure that Victim Services are there to provide the necessary support to these families.</p>
<p>In the past my colleague from Halifax Clayton Park and, I believe, my colleague from Bedford-Birch Cove have raised concerns regarding families who had reached the maximum available to them under Victim Services and had difficulties in accessing additional funding for counselling and other supports. We know of families that have been impacted by this and so one would certainly hope that the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education will have the opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister of Justice. If we're going to see Bill No. 3 go through this House, that as well there be recognition that there is an important role not only to ensure that people have employment opportunities still available to them, that they do not lose their employment, but at the same time that the families receive all the possible support made available to them in Victim Services.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, for those who are wondering what Victim Services is, it is a service provided by the Department of Justice. Pretty much any time you appear in court, whether it be for a speeding ticket or any other type of offence, for the most part the judge will order, if found guilty, what is called a victim impact surcharge. The fee from that goes into Victim Services, which is meant to assist victims of crime and families of victims of crime to access counselling and other related services that might be necessary.</p>
<p>Again, unfortunately in so many cases, governments have had to place limits on that, which has caused some issues for families, especially those of violent crime and those are issues that have been brought to our attention which, as I mentioned before, my colleagues have worked very hard to keep that on the government's radar and to ensure that those voices are being heard here in the Legislature.</p>
<p>One of the other issues that I wanted to raise and maybe the Government House Leader can advise us, is that I do remember a few years ago, prior to the last election, where the now Premier, when he was Leader of the Opposition, introduced a bill regarding army reservists. It was similar legislation that said if any reservists went into actual theatre of combat, I think that is how it is referred to, that when they return, their jobs would be protected.</p>
<p>I remember that not long ago the issue was raised that that was never proclaimed so maybe the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education, the Deputy Premier, can look into that to see what the status of that legislation is because that received all-Party support. I remember that not long ago when someone raised a question of where it was at, it had not been proclaimed. Hopefully that has changed from the last time that was raised and maybe the Government House Leader will be able to check into that to see what the status of that legislation is. I do know it was years after its passage and it hadn't been proclaimed yet. I'm certainly hopeful that Bill No. 3 is not going to take that long to implement, especially under a majority government which is bringing it forward.</p>
<p>With that, those are the comments I wish to make. Certainly we will be supportive of Bill No. 3 moving forward. Merci.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to rise on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I don't think I need too many notes prepared for this because there are a number of themes that run consistently through this Legislature. I think that when we sat through the almost hour of the Speech from the Throne we got to hear the government's favourite themes - we got to hear their buzz words and their slogans and their jingles that have been running this government for the last four years.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians are familiar with them because of the expensive advertising that is run on a regular basis, Better Care Sooner and so on and so on - there's a slogan for education and health and finance, and you name it.</p>
<p>You know some good things happen in this province and they don't always have a jingle, but those jingles and slogans, I don't believe, Madam Speaker, have very much substance to them. That is really why I was anxious to rise today and speak to the Throne Speech that we heard the other day because it repeatedly spoke of everything being a first - it was the first for this and the first for that and the first time we ever had a Legislature, practically, the first time that sensible people ever got together here and discussed anything. You'd think that they had invented the Legislature, really. It was beyond reason - one of the things it said was they've got the first immigration strategy ever.</p>
<p>Well, Madam Speaker, maybe they're calling it a strategy but I was here when we had the first Minister of Immigration ever, when we had our first nominee agreement signed with the federal government and created an Office of Immigration. There was definitely consultation done - and I'm not talking about Liberal consultation here, we were not in government. We had a Progressive Conservative Government at the time that did come out with a paper on immigration that did set targets for immigration, they did consult with immigrants and with universities and with people who could support immigrants. So it's a little bit galling to think that suddenly this government, the one across the way here, says that they're the first ever to do a strategy on immigration.</p>
<p>Really there's a lot of stretching of the truth throughout this entire Throne Speech. As I say, I didn't sit down to count how many times it was said but I'm sure there were at least a dozen times that the government boasted that they were the first to do this and the first to do that. Really it starts to almost take away from any of the accomplishments the government has had when there's so much embellishment, so much boastfulness.</p>
<p>To begin with, Madam Speaker, that Throne Speech, I believe it was - somebody said, is it the fourth or the fifth?</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Pictou East.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#5dac0dde-7ef3-4f75-a137-834785ff1ae4"><from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's an honour to rise from my seat and stand here as the member representing the people of Pictou East. I'm extremely grateful for the support I was shown in the election, and I am fully aware of the trust that the people of Pictou East have placed in me. Trust must be earned and never taken for granted, and I will work hard to honour their trust.</p>
<p>I am also fully aware of the trust my colleagues have placed in me by naming me the Finance and Treasury Board Critic. I thank them, too, for trusting me, and I look forward to getting to know the Minister of Finance and enjoying a productive working relationship with her. I respect the minister's accomplishments and admire her demeanor. I will be fair but vigilant, and I am sure that we will get along just fine.</p>
<p>The province is in need of good governance, good management, and I am hopeful that we will soon start to see just that as the celebrations and parties wane and the government gets down to business. I can tell you that I am standing here for just one reason: I am worried about the path our province is on. It is not a path that will create jobs where our children and their friends will be able to live and work in Nova Scotia. We must change direction. The government has promised to do just that, and I believe them. They will have every opportunity to do so. Now they just need to start doing it.</p>
<p>Members, I applaud you for putting your names forward and congratulate you on your election success. Rather than sitting back and criticizing, you are here. I thank you for doing that, the people of your constituencies thank you for that, and hopefully the people of the province will ultimately thank you.</p>
<p>Being an MLA is about working with people, understanding what is important to them, and working hard to get the results that they want and need. Each of us understands what a privilege it is to be elected and stand here in this prestigious Chamber. As many of you may know, I am a chartered accountant, and I come from the business side of things. As such I find comfort in numbers, and as I start my first speech here I want to calm myself by sharing a couple of numbers with you.</p>
<p>On October 8<sup>th</sup> I became the 40<sup>th</sup> person elected to represent the people of Pictou East - the 40<sup>th</sup> in a long line of, for the most part, impressive individuals. On that same day I also became just the third chartered accountant elected to this House. That is a number that has really given me pause for thought. Only three chartered accountants have been elected to represent their constituencies since Confederation - and all three were Tories, I will have you know. You know one of the other two. He is seated in front of me. Since Confederation, just three chartered accountants. I hope the government understands how fortunate it is to have two of the only three chartered accountants ever elected to the Legislature sitting directly across the aisle from them at this moment in time.</p>
<p>I am 43 years old. I like formulas. The 40<sup>th</sup> MLA, the third chartered accountant. Forty plus three equals 43. That's not a coincidence. I look forward to having many opportunities to discuss numbers in this Chamber.</p>
<p>The members of the Assembly share a common bond. Campaigning is not easy. We all did it, and it's impossible to explain what campaigning is like to somebody who has never campaigned. We all did it, and we share that bond.</p>
<p>As the members here will know, you never know the type of reaction you will receive when you knock on a door. I received every type of reaction from "I would never vote for the Tories, and if I did, it wouldn't be for you" to "I only vote for the Tories and you're the best candidate I've ever seen", and everything in between. I am sure that every member here today - and indeed, everyone who has had their name on a ballot - has similar experiences. But I will say this:</p>
<blockquote>The people of Pictou East are particularly polite,</blockquote>
<blockquote>Even in instances where their politics may not be right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On these doorsteps I forged some incredible allies,</blockquote>
<blockquote>And I will conduct myself to make them proud as I look them in the eyes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The issues and concerns of my constituents are real and here.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is now my job to make sure the government knows them and holds them dear.</blockquote>
<p>Nobody is here by accident, and I am no different. Like everyone in this room, I was powered by a great team - a team that started at home. My wife of 18 years, Carol; my 14-year-old daughter, Paget; and my 12-year-old son, Zachary, were my core team. They have been so supportive. They are always top of my mind, and will be top of my mind as we make decisions here. Carol supported me through my business career, and she readily supported me when I ran an idea by her for a new career. I remember discussing this idea with her, an idea to enter politics. Her immediate response was - well, let's skip her immediate response and go to her ultimate response, which was supportive.</p>
<p>You can't campaign without support at home. I had it, and I have it now, and I thank them for that. I must also say how much I respect and admire my children. They have made and are making incredible sacrifices. Carol and I work hard to balance the demands of a busy family and a busy constituency office, and I thank my children for their patience and understanding.</p>
<p>I want to share a little story that I think speaks to the character of my children. I remember on election night, in the midst of all the euphoria, my daughter quietly confided in me that she felt bad for telling me on such a happy night, but she felt sad for my opponents and she felt bad for Darrell Dexter. She felt bad for feeling bad. I hugged her and I told her that I understood exactly how she felt, and that is why we are who we are, because we have compassion. (Applause)</p>
<p>As politicians we will need resolve, but we will also need compassion. Madam Speaker, I would like to offer this: if you ever need to know which Pictou East church dinners have the best selection of desserts, my son will be happy to enlighten you. He has it all scoped out, as we have visited many such dinners on our way home from hockey or soccer, as the case may be.</p>
<p>When I talk about support, I must mention my in-laws, Art and Verna Steeves. My in-laws are also our neighbours, and they are always there to help get the children to and from events or feed our chickens or care for our dog. We rely on Art and Vern heavily, and I appreciate all that they do for us.</p>
<p>At this time I would also like to thank my brother and his family. Todd and Krista and Fynn and Kane and baby Bree were there for us on nomination night and again on election night, as were my sister Leanne and my parents, Lloyd and Sharon. I thank them.</p>
<p>For me, just securing the nomination was a challenge. It was a three-way contested nomination, and you may know that Houston is not what you would call a traditional Pictou County name. Early on in the campaigning process, a gentleman who would later become one of my biggest supporters said to me: Tim, I admire what you're doing and you're a good candidate, but I need you to do one thing for me. I need you to change your name to Tim MacHouston because if you are not a Mac in Pictou East, you have to have some beside you - and I was lucky to have the support of a number of Macs, the MacLeans, the MacGregors and the MacDonalds, to name a few.</p>
<p>They may not be happy to be acknowledged because they are private people but, Madam Speaker, without Stirling and Fraser, Hugh and Andy, and Dave and Murray, and their families, I would not be here. After securing the nomination in November 2012, I set about assembling a campaign team. In life you have to surround yourself with good people. I was able to and I am proud to say today that much of my core team that powered me are all undefeated in elections - yes, undefeated. Norm and Pat Lord, Sandy MacGregor, Chris Lamey, Rick Feehan, Seymour Dewtie, Morris Campbell, Leslie Ebert, Orville Mason, Tom and Jo-Ann Luddington, Mike and Gloria Yorke - these people, and countless others who stepped up to drive, to phone, to plant signs, and everything else necessary were doing so for the first time in their lives. They had never campaigned or actively been involved in a campaign before. They were first-timers and today they are all undefeated at 1- 0, as am I.</p>
<p>As the member for Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg likes to remind me - it is nice to have the energy and na&#xEF;vet&#xE9; of youth, but a little experience goes a long way too. I was also fortunate to have that necessary political experience around me as well, people like Albert and Florence Marshall, Cathy Boswell, Joan and Clary MacDonald, Cyril and Emily, Sharon MacDonald, Joanne MacHardy, Henrietta Hood, Doug MacNeil, Doug Porter, Blair, Daryl, and Dwayne, the Palmers, the Munroes, and Diane Campbell.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, every time each of these people said something nice about me, they were lending their good name to me and allowing me to piggyback on their reputation, and that is truly amazing to me. What they did for me is truly amazing.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, these are only a few of the people of Pictou East who need to be recognized for their dedication and commitment. If I were to name every deserving member of my team, it would take so much time that the other members in this Chamber would start checking their phones, initiating sidebar conversations, maybe even walking around, and we don't want that.</p>
<p>In recognizing the people who have helped me along the way, I will state the obvious. Campaigns take work; campaigns require good people, and I am glad to have the opportunity to acknowledge the commitment, dedication, personal sacrifice and hard work of these very special people and also their counterparts in the other political Parties who were so essential in making the political process work. These volunteers have earned and deserve a special vote of thanks from all of us for keeping democracy alive in our communities. We would be lesser communities without them. (Applause)</p>
<p>To have an opportunity to speak in this Chamber is quite an honour. The historical significance is something to treasure. If I ever forget the seriousness of the job to be done, I need look no further than the gallery or the intricate architecture that surrounds us, or even to the impressive uniform of the Sergeant-at-Arms, or the Chief and Assistant Clerks, or perhaps, Madam Speaker, even your robe, and the hat that Mr. Speaker donned on the very first day we assembled here - that was a splendid hat and I hope that we see it often for it is a reminder of tradition and respect.</p>
<p>I will work hard to uphold this respect; I will eagerly support the government when I believe it is making good decisions, but I will oppose them when I feel that they are in danger of harming my constituents and fellow Nova Scotians, and it is in those times that I will try extra hard to conduct myself with dignity.</p>
<p>The Speech from the Throne alluded to the complacency of the general public toward the political process. This group assembled here is now the one tasked with changing that. The people of our communities have sent us here to make decisions; the challenge is to make good decisions and I look forward to working with my colleagues in my caucus, with my colleagues on the government side, and also my friends to the left - literally. We have an opportunity to do some good so let's do it.</p>
<p>Now not to be outdone by some of the preceding speeches and those to follow, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my constituency, Pictou East. I should tell you that I am not a native of Pictou East, I actually did most of my growing up here in the city, in Fairview, and Carol grew up in Timberlea. After we got married we spent 12 years living outside of Canada and when we finally decided to return to Canada, we literally could have moved anywhere but we chose Pictou County and we chose Pictou East. The reason, we had simply fallen in love with the area during vacations and time spent there so when I speak affectionately about my constituency, it is sincere.</p>
<p>A former member for Pictou East offered a great description of the constituency and with your indulgence, I will borrow it here:</p>
<blockquote>Pictou East is bounded on the north by the Northumberland Strait with miles of sandy beaches, inlets and quaint villages such as Chance Harbour - where I live - Merigomish, Lismore, and to the south by rolling hills, scenic valleys and forests. The Trans-Canada Highway runs right through the constituency from west to east. This is an area that is as economically diverse as it is geographically dispersed. Our major urban centre is the Town of Westville, with its proud history of coal mining. Together with a loose collection of villages that dot the landscape, each with their own identity, Pictou East has historic charm. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Resource-based industries are important to my constituency. The forestry, the farming and the fishery employ many of my friends and neighbours. </blockquote>
<p>I must thank former member Jim DeWolfe for that description and I hope he doesn't mind that I used it here.</p>
<p>To stress the geographic size of the riding I should tell you that the people of Pictou East are protected by the services of no less than 11 district fire departments: Pictou Landing, Little Harbour, Merigomish, Barney's River, Linacy, Thorburn, Blue Mountain, East River St. Marys, Eureka, East River Valley and Westville - 11 fire departments. I'm sure that may surprise many members.</p>
<p>Those of us who represent rural ridings know that fire halls are often the centre of the community. They host many events and believe me, each of these fire departments can barbeque an excellent pork chop or chicken dinner. Government must support volunteer fire departments where it can. They keep us safe.</p>
<p>The people of the communities of Pictou East know that being an MLA isn't just about shaking hands and slapping backs. It's about representing people, it's about getting issues fixed. That is what they have asked me to do and that is what I will do. To that end, Madam Speaker, the people of Nova Scotia were obviously not happy on October 8<sup>th</sup>; they wanted change. Clearly the people were not optimistic yet the government of the day was insisting that they should be optimistic. The budget is balanced, they said, and times are good. But, as we can see, people didn't believe it, and why should they? When times are good and budgets are balanced, people do feel good, but I wasn't seeing it and I wasn't hearing it in my conversations at the rinks or the boardroom.</p>
<p>Young people were and are leaving our communities, our province, and moving west for opportunities they can't find here. This is the sad reality of the situation. So people voted for change and I'm not sure that the people are any more optimistic today than they were before October 8<sup>th</sup> but we need to give this government every chance to show them that they can be optimistic and, Madam Speaker, I'm prepared to do just that. This government is telling us it will be different and I sincerely hope that it is.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I'm looking forward to the financial update that is due mid-December. I promised my constituents that I would make sure the government is making good, long-term financial decisions. I will be watching closely because an area of experience where our governments have traditionally been woefully lacking is business common sense. I want to help bring some practical business sense and sound financial practice back to our provincial government and I want the government to know that I am here to help. We are all here to help. We need to bring accountability and calculated decision making back to government. I want the government to know that I am here to help. We're all here to help.</p>
<p>With all this talk of a new decorum, I'm encouraged that maybe this government will accept some of the feedback that we will provide. After all, we heard many references to open-mindedness in the Speech from the Throne. It talked about the government engaging with Nova Scotians, about seeking input from the people of the province, about making sure that Nova Scotians are not excluded from the decision-making process. These are all good things.</p>
<p>We even heard the member for Halifax Atlantic say that a good idea is a good idea, no matter where it comes from, and I agree. I want the government to know that whenever it needs some good ideas, it shouldn't be afraid to ask because over here on this side we have quite a few good ideas.</p>
<p>I was also pleased to hear the member for Dartmouth South say that his government will listen, then act. I do sincerely believe that this is his intention. But I remind the member that simply saying it is so doesn't make it so. The people of Nova Scotia do want you to listen. On the door steps I heard over and over that people are tired of politicians assuming they know it all and then proceeding to make the same mistakes over and over. The people of Nova Scotia are looking for a government that will change course based on feedback where necessary. They, like me, want you to admit when you are wrong. Please don't be afraid to admit that you are wrong. We'll always be willing to give you that opportunity and I'll even give you the opportunity right now to make your first such admission should you choose. Hearing nothing, I will proceed.</p>
<p>I want to believe that it is the intention of this government to listen to the people and I have to admit that early returns are positive. Quite often people who are in need reach out to everyone possible; sometimes we see people contacting every single MLA in the province and sometimes beyond. I have at least two cases where my constituents reached out to a minister and myself, simultaneously. I have to tip my hat and give credit because both of these ministers have responded to these constituents and I thank these ministers for that. But it is early and mine is a small sample size, but thank you for listening to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I do want to touch on a couple of areas of particular concern to the people of Pictou East and no doubt all of Nova Scotia - education. I am pleased to hear about the government committing to making investments in education to ensure that every child has access to a modern curriculum. Every child in Nova Scotia should have the same access to education no matter where they live. Sadly, this is not currently the case. As I am sure the Minister of Education is aware, the junior high students of Highland Consolidated Middle School do not have access to the same types of labs and activities that exist in other schools. The students of Highland Consolidated are currently sharing a building with the elementary students of Dr. W.A. MacLeod Elementary School because the Highland Consolidated building has been closed. I am sure the minister will agree with me that this is a situation that needs to be addressed. The students of Highland are being shortchanged.</p>
<p>I am also thinking about the students of Frank H. MacDonald Elementary School and East Pictou Middle School. Both of my children attend East Pictou and our community is looking for leadership from the Department of Education as it seeks to have Frank H. expanded into a P to 8. Again, I believe the minister is aware of this and I look forward to giving her any necessary assistance on this matter. I am hopeful that some of the government's reinvestment in our schools will make sure that all students have comfortable, conducive facilities. The students of my constituency deserve it. Nova Scotia deserves it.</p>
<p>This government has a chance to provide leadership and empower teachers with the right tools, so let's put our spend on education dollars to the best possible use. Remember those famous words, that if you think education is expensive, try ignorance. We need these kids to not just graduate and get a job but to create jobs. I hope this government is open-minded as it conducts its curriculum review, and maybe it will even consider ways to ground students and young people to their communities, possibly by incorporating volunteerism into the curriculum in some way.</p>
<p>We need jobs. We need new companies, but we also need our existing companies to grow. As a province, we need to find a way to create opportunities for companies to be successful here. The government has stated that it will meet the needs of entrepreneurs through appropriate forms of assistance, but what business needs is customers, not loans or assistance. Government should be a customer of Nova Scotia businesses where it can, and this has not happened enough.</p>
<p>Talking to business owners and being in business, I have heard many stories of how difficult it has been to do business with the government. This government will have a chance to change that. I appreciate that as MLAs we come from different backgrounds, so I would invite the members to talk to some of the business owners in their constituencies and get perspective on their experiences selling to government. They may find business owners that missed out on government tenders for miniscule amounts or silly reasons, and we can't have this. Nova Scotia companies that win contracts hire people in their shops, they hire local truckers - the spinoff is real. I challenge the ministers to keep this in mind as they see tenders awarded within their departments.</p>
<p>This government wants to direct more economic attention to small- and medium-sized businesses, and I offer this as an area where they should be willing to look closely. We need to support our manufacturing industry. We, as elected officials, need to create an environment where business has a chance to be successful. I can't stress enough to this government what a customer means to a business. It means more than a loan, and it means more than assistance. Customers drive business.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'm worried that we still have Cabinet-controlled slush funds. It hasn't worked in the past. Every government has tried it. The NDP took it to new levels, but everyone has tried it. It's an old idea. What we need is new ideas, and the reality is that jobs are not created 300 or 400 at a time. Jobs are created one at a time, two at a time. This government has an opportunity to help business. Please take it.</p>
<p>I was disappointed to only see one line about agriculture and fisheries in the Speech from the Throne. I'm sure my colleague, the member for Kings North, will have much more to say about this, but for today I would like to remind the government of the importance of these two industries to our province. They are particularly important to Pictou East, but they are equally important to all of us.</p>
<p>The fishery is a diverse industry, and right from the wharves in my constituency, boats leave and return with lobster, tuna, and herring, to name just a few. When we think about the lobster fishery - and I am thinking about some of my good friends who make their living from the lobster fishery - Kenny, Edwin, Sammy, JD, and the Brown family, to name just a few - I think about what the lobster fishery means to my community. The lobster fishery is significant to the province.</p>
<p>Just last week we had two resolutions read in this House regarding the lobster fishery, yet this is a fishery that saw strike action last year. Most people in Pictou East know a lobster fisherman. They enjoy a lobster. Lots of people in Pictou East have been out on a lobster boat either as a spectator or as a worker. We have an appreciation for the value of the product, and we understand what is involved in lobster fishing. I can tell you that having worked many a settin' and haulin' day myself, I certainly realize how hard fishermen work and they deserve a fair price. I sincerely hope that this government accepts the importance of the fisheries and intends to pay it more than just one line of lip service. Let's work with the fishermen to ensure that they get a fair price.</p>
<p>Let's talk about roads. I was pleased to hear that the member for Lunenburg had visited Pictou East; at least I assume she was talking about Pictou East when she mentioned her concerns about roads, roads and roads. Roads are an important part of rural life; people should be able to get around. I had an elderly lady tell me that she finds it expensive to get back and forth to town, just on account of the price of gas. Then she says, if I hit a pothole and blow a tire or damage my car, I just don't have the money to fix it.</p>
<p>This is how roads can impact people's lives. I have seen it and every member who represents a rural riding has seen it. I must say that I have been impressed by what I have seen out of the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal under this new minister and I look forward to seeing more good things because there is much work to be done.</p>
<p>Many people in Pictou East make their livelihoods from our natural resources and in particular, our forest lands. My good friend Seymore Dewtie has made his living hauling pulpwood for 30 years but Seymore now regularly leaves his family and his grandchildren to head out West and work. Nowadays it's incredibly difficult to make a living from the woods. We need to make sure that we are properly using our resources and I hope that each member, each minister, new and old, has a Seymore Dewtie that they know and respect and that they can think about as they make decisions in their portfolio. The decisions you make as a government affect people, so let your own Seymore Dewtie be on your mind as you make those decisions.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, let's talk about the hospital. The Aberdeen Hospital serves a large catchment area, certainly all of Pictou County and also beyond, particularly where orthopaedics are concerned. It is an important asset of our community. I thank this government for acknowledging that it must carefully review any changes in the district health authority structure before it moves forward. I ask that the government not shortchange the people of Pictou County and the people of Pictou East as it implements changes.</p>
<p>The prior government approved budget for modernization of our emergency room and pharmacy but it stretched out the time to get the renovations done by a number of years, which delays the completion of the project out as far as 2016. Stretching out construction means increasing costs in the long run. This is important work and the modernization will help stabilize the number of physicians in our area. This government has a chance to show leadership - the sooner the work can be done, the better. Happily, this is a project that fits nicely with this government's plan to get doctors to rural areas and keep them there.</p>
<p>I also want to note the importance of our seniors to our communities. Our seniors were let down by the last government. We need to treat them with dignity and make sure that they receive the best support. We owe that to them.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'd like to take a minute to raise some environmental concerns. If I devote one minute to the environment it will be more than was devoted to the environment in the entirety of the Speech from the Throne. The only mention of the environment in that speech was that the government intends to remove the <i>MV Miner</i> from the Cape Breton coastline. Sadly, there was no mention about Boat Harbour or the Nova Scotia Power fly ash situation. These are two big issues affecting the people of Pictou East and I would be happy to work with the government as the new minister gets up to speed on these files.</p>
<p>Now I realize that each minister most likely has a file in their portfolio that maybe they wish wasn't there. They have likely each inherited things that maybe they wish they did not but the reality is that now each is the member responsible for those files and in the case of the environment, the boat harbour situation is not going away and neither am I so let's work together to deal with it head-on.</p>
<p>Now, Madam Speaker, perhaps it would have been more fun to stand here today and talk solely about the lovely golf courses of my constituency or the beautiful landscape, but as you can see, I am worried; there is a lot of work to be done. I am, and I know my entire caucus is ready to work with this government to get it done because the challenges that this province faces didn't wait for the election. Good representation starts with understanding the issues that matter to our communities and then working with our communities to find solutions. We all know that issues did not go away simply because there was an election. It's now time for the government to govern and the people expect big things from this new government, and I promise to hold the new government to account.</p>
<p>In closing, Madam Speaker, I want you to know that our Pictou East constituency office is up and running and my wonderful constituency assistant Sue Uhren will be happy to greet you with a smile if you ever find yourself passing through Pictou County because we are ready and willing to help, and I want to believe this government is too. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <heading>ENERGY - MAR. LINK: REVIEW - TIMELINE</heading>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and have the leave of the House to discuss what I think is an extremely important matter, and a pressing matter, that has been raised repeatedly in recent weeks by independent people outside of this Legislature, who are calling on the government to amend the regulations around the Maritime Link Act, to allow the Utility and Review Board additional time to review the volume of information that has come before it.</p>
<p>Now, let's review why we're at the point we are. A number of weeks ago, some of the interveners wrote the Utility and Review Board and requested that the board extend the timeline for that process. On March 15, 2013, the board wrote a letter back and talked about a number of the issues that they had raised, but one of them pointed out, "The <i>Regulations </i>under the <i>Maritime Link Act</i> impose a strict timeline for the review and decision on this matter and accordingly, the Board is not in a position to give any substantial extension for the filing." And I'll table that letter. As a follow-up to that, the Utility and Review Board's Executive Director, Mr. Paul Allen, again noted that the timeline is governed by legislation and said, "The board can't go outside the regulations, 'said Allen, noting the only way this process will go on longer than 180 days is via an order in council.'" and I'll table that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, these requests have come from the Consumer Advocate, the Small Business Advocate, the Canadian Wind Association, the Sierra Club, Grand Riverkeeper Labrador, both the Third Party and the Official Opposition, all signing on as interveners of this and stating that, listen, there's a lot of information that's there that should be - for example, let me read a section from the letter of the Consumer Advocate, who is a non-partisan representative of consumer ratepayers in this province.</p>
<p>In his letter to the Premier, he says, "How the Board deals with this application is a matter of importance to not only Nova Scotia ratepayers, but to the Province as a whole. The decision of the Board will affect the supply and cost of energy for Nova Scotia for years to come. All Nova Scotians are entitled to be assured the Board has adequate time to access and consider all relevant evidence and determine what is the &#x2026;" lowest-cost, long-term advantage. "We support any request that would provide the Board with further time to carry out its analysis and to arrive at a decision which will be the benefit for the Province."</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, this isn't about politics trying to delay a process. This is about the interveners that the minister himself said that he consulted with, saying, you know what? There's far more documentation and information in this process than anybody believed would happen, and it is only fair to Nova Scotians that all of that is able to go through.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago was the first deadline for interveners - or for the response as interveners. As late as yesterday, Nova Scotia Power - or Maritime Link Incorporated, which is the proponent - were filing corrections to that information. That's almost a month later that they're filing corrections to that initial data. Of course we're pleased that they're filing the corrections. That's very good, but it means that the interveners reviewing that information have lost almost a month in the process just from that very fact.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the other day I asked the minister if he would simply consider changing the Order in Council, which is a very simple process - to say, do you know what, we're going to let the board decide. This minister stands up repeatedly in this House and tells us how the board will make the best decision. Well, the board is telling us they would like that - they would be willing to make that best decision on how long is necessary, but he won't let them. He needs to answer to Nova Scotians about why he won't give them that power.</p>
<p>He stood the other day and said that the Opposition supported the Maritime Link Act, which would allow the review. Well, Madam Speaker, let me read from Hansard of that time, because he's absolutely right that we supported the Act. Let me read exactly what I said:</p>
<blockquote>"I think we'll certainly support the bill, as imperfect as it is, and when I say imperfect, the one thing that I think is missing in this is the fact that we are left with a hastily-crafted bill that designs everything in regulation and says, well - it's basically a bill that says this allows the Cabinet to create regulations to do this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I think it would have been better for the public, at this stage in the game, to have seen in the legislation a complete list of the issues that the board will cover in the review of the Maritime Link. There are many issues and we have to leave it to our belief that Cabinet will ensure that those regulations are appropriate and ensure an appropriate review, and I think we have mixed feelings on that. So we're going to have to wait and see what those regulations come out."</blockquote>
<p>I'll table that. So yes, we voted for it because we believed the minister when he said, and when the Premier said, that they would allow the board to conduct a full and complete analysis of this. In fact, they have not.</p>
<p>I pointed out the fact that one of the risks in that legislation was what this government would do with regulations, but because it was in the dying days of a session, there was no real other option. We were either going to have no review at all or we were going to have a review that is crafted by the regulation - a review that for weeks the Premier and the Energy Minister had insisted didn't need legislation to happen, but which we raised and said, no, you do.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there is no way that anybody in this province can know whether this is the best alternative for Nova Scotians, whether the deal structure makes sense, without having a complete analysis of the information. The experts in the field - the experts who do this all the way through - have said with near unanimity that there is not enough time to review the information, so it makes no sense. The only reason that you would continue with this time frame is if you felt that there was something that was going to make you look bad coming out.</p>
<p>The question is, does the government feel that giving more time will mean that the consumer advocate and the small business advocate and the Utility and Review Board will find out things that the government is hoping get missed?</p>
<p>We've all heard the civil lawsuits where the defendant in the lawsuit will bury the plaintiff in paper, so that they hope that in the disclosure - and that's exactly what's happening before the board now. I'm even willing to give the minister the credit to say that he may very well have felt, with the best advice, that six months would be long enough when he passed those regulations. He very well could have, but he has to be strong enough and he has to defend Nova Scotians in his position to understand that the people we rely on to ensure that this is being treated fairly - the small business advocate, the consumer advocate - are saying, you know what? We have now seen how much information there is going to be in this hearing and there is not enough time.</p>
<p>The minister is the only person in this province who has the ability to change that. If he doesn't change it, there is no reason for a single Nova Scotian to believe that this is the best choice for Nova Scotia. The fact is that there is an issue with being at the end of the energy line. The minister is right about that. In fact, this caucus was talking about that before he was. The concerns we have raised are about the deal. They are concerns that are no different than members who are before the boards such as the Canadian Wind Association, natural gas producers and, again, the Small Business Advocate and Consumer Advocate are raising - in fact, that board and the board's own council have raised some of those questions.</p>
<p>This is a deal where we are being asked to pay 100 per cent of the cost of a piece of infrastructure that we will not own at the end of the day. This is a deal where in Newfoundland and Labrador they are talking about the fact that they're thrilled to finally not be tied to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec and, in fact, now they are getting the best end of the deal.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? That's great for Newfoundland and Labrador, but that doesn't mean that it's automatically the best deal for Nova Scotia. And if this minister believes that this deal truly is the best for Nova Scotians, that the way it's structured is absolutely the best, he should have no fear about saying to the board, have the time you need, I know that when you review this information that Nova Scotians will find out that this is the best deal, that this is the lowest cost alternative, that this is the most secure supply. But the way that this is currently structured, it is almost a guarantee that some of the issues before the board will simply not be covered.</p>
<p>They have recently, just last week, the board had to move the hearing to Saint Mary's, and they had to move the hearing to Saint Mary's because their board offices won't have enough room for all the interveners. Well that's great, but normally what will happen in some of the general rate hearings is if we get to the end of the four or five days that are scheduled, that all the questions haven't been asked, well okay we'll look at our calendar and we'll schedule another four or five days next month to continue this. This timetable does not even give the board that option. What that means - I don't know whether the minister thinks that the board should go into 24-hour sessions if that happens, like we've seen in the Legislature in some years, or whether he just thinks they should just say I guess those matter aren't going to be discussed.</p>
<p>The board already expanded the issues list, when they started this, by two or three items. They are going to look into the water rights management issue to some extent, they are going to look into the issue of what about the security of supply issue, what happens if Nova Scotia is faced with a brownout because the line goes down in northwestern Newfoundland and Labrador where Manitoba Hydro has said that's possible, and an outage could last 30 to 60 days, extended periods. They are going to look into that, which makes sense, but the minister, when they added those, did not extend the timeline.</p>
<p>The board does not have the time to go out and hire independent consultants, so instead they are going to rely on consultants that were hired by the proponents of this project, the proponents being the Premier, the minister, and Emera. They don't have the ability to go out because they don't have the time. The Consumer Advocate, again, same problem - they can't go out and hire a consultant to completely review this information. Why? Because any consultant they would choose to hire simply doesn't have the time to go through all the information.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, time and time again in this House, this minister and the Premier have stood and said that they rely on the Utility and Review Board. They've stood and they've said that they rely on the Small Business Advocate and on the Consumer Advocate to make decisions and to help make decisions that are in the best interest of Nova Scotians. I wonder why it is that the minister thinks that now that those people are coming to him and coming to the Premier and saying they need more time, that he's now saying no and throwing them under the bus. Why is he doing that?</p>
<p>He needs to stand in this House and explain why because last week he said we consulted with the Consumer Advocate and we consulted with the board and they thought six months would be enough. And I believe him; I'm sure they said that at the time. But he also knows that since then - and I just tabled the letter - they have written and said you know what? It turns out it's not enough time, there is no way for us to get through that information. The Small Business Advocate has submitted a similar letter to the Premier; the Canadian Wind Association has submitted another letter; and I tabled another letter signed by most of the other interveners in the hearing.</p>
<p>You know, Madam Speaker, the reality is there is nothing wrong and nothing at risk by giving more time to ensure that the right decision is made for Nova Scotians (Applause) And you know what? Maybe, just maybe, the minister will be right, and if more time is given they'll go, you know, this is the best option. But most Nova Scotians don't know, and increasingly more Nova Scotians are falling into that column of, I'm not sure that this is the best deal because I don't feel good about it, I don't feel good that the government isn't willing to be open and transparent about this. I don't trust the government because it feels like they're hiding something by sticking to this 180 days.</p>
<p>The fact is, on March 19<sup>th</sup> the minister said, if they feel they need additional time for interveners to review the material, that will be their decision. But he knew it wasn't their decision. The fact was, they don't have that ability but that's what he said to the media in that article. He said that the board could make that decision to do it but he knows it's only Cabinet's.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I call on the minister to stand up and say he will give them more time to prove this is in the best interests of Nova Scotia, that this is the right way to go. And if he doesn't do that, tell us what he's hiding. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Thank you, definitely Madam Speaker, it's an honour to stand in this Chamber. I was very fortunate to have the support of the community, to have my return to the Legislature - which I'm very appreciative of - for my fourth term. Just for the new members of the Legislature, going almost into my 11<sup>th</sup> year, it goes by really quickly so be careful because you never know how much time goes by. Also I think there is a new club, where I can have some of my former colleagues here join, that I've had the opportunity to sit in every position of the Legislature.</p>
<p>I first want to begin by appreciating and thanking you and saying that I respect the results of the last election and I'm going to work extremely hard to represent my community of Sackville-Cobequid here in this historic Chamber. It is an honour and privilege, I think, for all members here to have this opportunity. There are not too many Nova Scotians who have been given this opportunity to represent their communities here on the floor of the Legislature, the oldest Legislature in the country. It truly is something that each and every member here should appreciate and recognize.</p>
<p>I want to say thank you to many of the people who have supported me over the years, especially in my community, in order for me to continue to be the MLA here in the Legislature. Of course, I know all members here have had many people support them. There is always a team around you during any election and it's no different in my case even after four elections, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>I have to thank my family: my parents, my brothers-in-law, my brother, my sisters-in-law, my brothers-in-law, but more importantly my wife and my two kids - my wife Penny, my daughter Taylor, and my son Jacob who are 15 and 12. I know the Premier has said this on a number of occasions around being the Class of 2003, the year I entered this Chamber, and how during that year people were starting school and now of course they are in high school. When he said that it really brought me to think about my own personal situation where my first caucus meeting after winning the election in 2003 was the first day of Primary for my daughter and now she's in Grade 10 in high school. It's amazing to see how much time has gone by, and it's amazing to see how they change and the influence you have on your kids, being in this position as a politician. You hope, and I hope this for my kids, that they have a respect for the political process, that they have a respect for ensuring that people respect and hopefully vote during an election.</p>
<p>I also had a great number of individuals on this campaign, Madam Speaker. As I said, this was my fourth election, and each election was different, each team was different, but I have to say that during this campaign I was fortunate to have a number of young people join my campaign team. I had university students, I had high school students, I had junior high school students, I even had elementary kids helping out on this campaign, which is amazing. That's really what you want to see, and I know all members of the House had similar experiences. It's so good to see that. We need to work extremely hard as parliamentarians to make sure that our residents recognize the importance of being engaged, down to the simple thing of getting out to vote. We know it has been a challenge. It has been a challenge since my first election in 2003. We went through a number of different initiatives to try to encourage Nova Scotians to be active, to get involved, to vote.</p>
<p>I know in the Throne Speech there was another mention of that, and I'll do whatever I can to support the government in ensuring that Nova Scotians recognize the importance of ensuring that they have a say, ensuring that they get involved, and that they vote in the election.</p>
<p>I had a number of young people who worked on my campaign who were foot canvassers - they used the telephone, they did drops on the doorsteps, and I would like to just thank a few of them by name. Andre Anderson, Ian Best, Katrina Cobean, Matthew Forbes, Madeline Mitchell, Caitlyn Woolaver, Alex Holmes, Nick Malbeuf, and Kaylyn Mundle were just a few of the young people who got active. One of our best phone canvassers was a young gentleman named Matthew who came into the campaign, who wanted to do whatever he could. So we tried him on the phone, and we were a little leery because he's Grade 9, he's 15. We didn't know if he could use the phone - or I knew he could use the phone. I'd better watch what I say. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Well, you never know these days. They don't use the phone a lot - they text a lot. But I have to say this young gentleman, who attends Cavalier Drive, was one of the best we had on the phones. He was mature, he was respectful, and it was a treat to get to know him and see him engaged. I just hope that that continues on down the road.</p>
<p>The other thing that was different about this campaign too, not only that we had young people, is that we had families. We had the Harnishs, the Campbells, the Woodworths, the Wilsons, the Deckers, and the Livelys. These were people who came out, who went around driving signs in the lawns. They went and dropped doorknockers off. Some of them came in and made phone calls. They would input data in our computers. Some of them made food. It was amazing to see such a diverse group of people, and I have to say, it was different than in campaigns in the past. I think, like many, most of those who are engaged in politics or engaged in our political Parties tend to be there for a long time. The mavericks of the Party, we had a really high - you know, they were older, senior, more mature people, but this campaign was different. We've had such a mix. My youngest volunteer was eight, I think, and the more mature people were in their 80s. Every day I appreciated getting to interact with those individuals.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my campaign manager, Wayne Copeland, and also Tammy Harnish, who worked every single day to support me. Also Colleen Smith, Terry Decker - and another person who supported me throughout the campaign was my colleague Mat Whynott, the former MLA for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville. We shared an office. So in the morning and in the evening we got together to debrief and figure out how the campaign was going and what did we need to do. Without that support I don't think any of us would be here today. I truly want to thank those who took the time to get involved, most importantly those who donated the food, first and foremost, to the campaign but those who did manage to donate and give financial support for the election. I think each of us know that it does take money to run an election and it's not the easiest thing to do, to go and ask people to fund your campaign or donate money to try to get you elected in the Legislature. None of us here could do it without that support.</p>
<p>I'd like to turn to my riding. I've done this on a number of occasions and it's a great opportunity during the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne to explain where we're from and give a picture of the community we represent. I know that with this new session, with the 51 MLAs - I know we're down one riding - it's going to take me some time to, first, learn the names of all the new people but, more importantly, the riding names that even my own member for Truro-Bible Hill-Salmon River, and there's another - Millbrook - and I don't know what order they are in, I still have to wrap my head around that. I'm hoping that over the next couple of weeks with the session that I'll get to meet the new members, try to learn a little bit more and listen to their speeches on the communities they represent.</p>
<p>Sackville is a suburb of Halifax. It was founded, I think, in 1749 and it was kind of an outpost on the way down to the Valley. If you left here, there was a stagecoach stop, the Fultz House was an inn where you could stop and get supplies. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a real need for housing in Halifax and the surrounding areas. A lot of work went into co-operative housing to allow people at that time, who couldn't afford, I think, or maybe it was more difficult to purchase a home or have one built. That's what happened out in Sackville, a lot of provincial land was there and it was bought up so that people could go in on these co-ops to purchase their houses and the supplies for their homes. That's how my family went there, both my parents were in the military and this was a great opportunity for them to build a new home and raise a family. I've been very fortunate to have spent almost my whole life in Sackville. It's a great community where you can get great deals on cars but there's more than just car dealerships in Sackville.</p>
<p>We have many different community-based organizations, many sports teams out in our community and there's always something to do for somebody. If you want to go to one of the many dinners put on by our service groups or the churches that are throughout the community, they put on fundraisers for meals. If you want to catch a sporting event we have, of course, the Sackville Blazers, a hockey team that has been there for many, many years. We have two high schools that have an array of sports going on every single night of the week pretty much. We have of course basketball, hockey organizations, lacrosse, volleyball, football and soccer and many more. I know I'll get an e-mail and that's the challenge, when you forget somebody someone will always e-mail you and say you forgot about them.</p>
<p>We have many groups and organizations out there so that you can find something to do on any given night. We also have the artistic or the cultural side. We have some great organizations and theatre groups, like Eventurous Theatre, who put on plays and dinner theatres throughout the year. We have organizations that give so much back to the community, like the Lions Club and Kinsmen Club who work extremely hard to provide services that often aren't provided through services that government provides. I've always said that in Opposition and in government, that the government cannot provide every service to every person in the province. We realize that, that's the reality of the province we live in.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for some of these service groups - and I know they're throughout communities across Nova Scotia - people really would be disadvantaged. I know the groups in our community work extremely hard to make sure that people who might need additional support get it. We have the Salvation Army and other church organizations. I can't name all the churches, there are many in Sackville that also provide support for the community, not only as a faith-based organization but support for people.</p>
<p>We have the Royal Canadian Legion in Sackville, which provides amazing support for our veterans throughout not only Lower Sackville, but the surrounding areas. (Interruption)</p>
<p>I've done a full hour a few times - that's the challenge and I hope that the new members recognize what a challenge it is to try to get on your feet and talk for an hour. When you do it your colleagues who have been there longer than you will take you out for a beverage and make sure you don't - and they'll pick up the coverage for that, right? I was going to say your name, but I've been here long enough not to say your name. But it is a challenge and it's a great opportunity - this is the time when you can speak about your community and really engage in what's going on in the community you represent.</p>
<p>We have a number of organizations in Sackville that really have taken it to another level on ensuring that our environment is protected. We have the Sackville Rivers Association, which has done amazing work not only in Lower Sackville but throughout the province in trying to restore some of the damage that has been done to our ecosystem through development. Sackville, for example, is one of those tales that for many, many years in the 1970s and even really going into the 1980s, and of course the airport being not too far from the community, there are two lakes in Sackville, one is First Lake and Second Lake and then there's Third Lake going up further - I don't know who named them all, but I think they could have been more enthusiastic, but they're great lakes.</p>
<p>First Lake was often a focal point for those pilots coming into the airport because it was just brown because of all the runoff from the development over the years in Sackville. Many organizations have worked to try to improve the quality of the ecosystem around - as I said, the Sackville Rivers Association, and Friends of First Lake have worked extremely hard to protect First Lake and make sure they build trails so that people can come back and see some of the work that they've done.</p>
<p>Also, Second Lake Park Association has worked for many, many years - I know some of the members here have heard of that organization over the years - I have always tried to bring it up in the Legislature to ensure that we support and government supports their initiatives. I was very proud to be part of a government that recently - I believe it was in May - announced one of the first in over 20 years, I believe, provincial parks in Sackville and it's called Sackville Lakes Provincial Park and it oversees part of First Lake, but a lot of area around Second Lake, over 650 acres is protected now, is designated as a provincial park, something that will be there for generations to come - and it has been a long journey to get to that point.</p>
<p>I have been in the Legislature over 10 years and I brought it up every year, and even in government there were some challenges, so I was glad early last year to be able to be there with the Premier and the Minister of Natural Resources to designate a new provincial park, Sackville Lakes Provincial Park, in the heart of Sackville. It is because of the work of those from Second Lake Park Association, Friends of First Lake, Sackville Rivers, and many, many people who knew the importance of having such an area protected in a really developed area.</p>
<p>One of the things I paid attention to was the Throne Speech and listening to what the new government was going to tell Nova Scotians was the vision of their government - really that's what a Throne Speech is, it tells Nova Scotians what they're going to do and it should tell them how they're going to do it, when they're going to do it, and show the path forward. Listening to the Throne Speech - and I've listened to many of them over the years - I felt it was very light on details, a lot of things in there that sound great, but what Nova Scotians want is to see how the new government is going to do some of the things they said they were going to do, especially in the last campaign. Like all members here, when you go door-to-door there are concerns that come forward and we, as political Parties, try to give them some information and try to tell them how we're going to move forward on those issues that are important to them - and that's how they base, I believe, their decision on election day to vote for either Party or a candidate.</p>
<p>One of the first opportunities for government, even if it's a government that was re-elected or a first-time government, is in the Throne Speech to tell Nova Scotians exactly where and how they're going to proceed with the commitments that they made in the election. When I looked through, and heard and sat trying to hear what the government was going to do, as I said initially, it was light on the details. That concerns me.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I take my role extremely serious as an elected official, but of course as Opposition members we have a role - Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have a role to play in the makeup of this Legislature, and that's to keep the government accountable for those commitments they made in their campaign and how they move forward. Over the coming weeks and the coming years, that's exactly what I will be doing as Health and Wellness Critic and as Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations Critic, and our caucus will hold the government accountable.</p>
<p>A couple of the areas that I was a little bit concerned around was when they mentioned the development of the province's first cultural strategy which will establish a new vision for culture in Nova Scotia. The reason it kind of concerns me a little bit is that there had been a lot of work done, over the past four years or plus, in the area of arts and culture. I think we would all agree here on the floor of this Legislature that we have some amazing artists throughout Nova Scotia. The good thing about our artists is that they don't need to be located just here in Halifax or in Sydney, in the more populated areas, we have amazing artists all over the province - in the smallest, most remote communities because that's where they find it best for whatever discipline they are in.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I was very glad to be the province's first Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. It really opened my eyes to the opportunity we have in front of us to grow and create a creative economy that really will contribute to the overall economy of the province. In rural Nova Scotia especially, we've seen over the last decades huge manufacturing industries leaving rural Nova Scotia, one of the things that did stay and we see it time and time again, what actually has great potential to grow is that creative economy side.</p>
<p>I know, as minister at the time, that was an important area and that's why we came forward with a five-point plan around the creative economy. I was pleased to be able to do that with the Premier in February 2011, about a month after I was sworn in as the new minister. One of the first things we did and one of the things we recognized is that we needed to engage the sector, we needed to ensure that they were part of the solution or part of how we moved forward to grow the creative economy. One of the first things we needed to do was establish an organization to oversee arts funding.</p>
<p>Arts Nova Scotia was created and that took the responsibility or the oversight from the minister, who at the time had the authority to say, yes, this organization should receive arts funding, this one should, this one might not, and it gives it to an independent body. That independent body decides where it goes. Those people who work within the arts and culture community are the best people, I believe, and are in the best position to fund where government's funding for arts and culture should go.</p>
<p>That was one of the things we did, and the other thing was to form what used to be the Nova Scotia Arts and Culture partnership. We created the Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council, and this council is, again, independent from the department, from government. There is a whole range of individuals with different experiences, bringing different cultural expertise to a council that advises a government, advises the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage.</p>
<p>One of the first things they did was to create a strategic plan and a cultural strategy. The whole role of the Nova Scotia Leadership Council was to have this cultural strategy and provide insight and vision to grow the province's creative economy. I hope, by what was put in the Speech from the Throne, that they will go to the creative leadership council and seek advice from them. I don't believe you need to reinvent and try to come up with a new system, I think everybody would recognize and appreciate that if it's arm's length, if it's people within that sector driving where the funding and support and initiative should be, I think that really is where we should be.</p>
<p>They, of course, worked to come up with a strategy about Status of the Artist legislation, which we implemented, introduced, and passed. They are also working on creative economy emphasis on strategic initiatives that will foster winning conditions here in Nova Scotia for the creative economy. They also are going to work on outreach to make sure that people out in different communities have a good communication with the council, with Arts Nova Scotia, so that they know about opportunities that get funding for initiatives that they are working on. They also are going to work on communications and the Arts Endowment Fund, which I think is a great opportunity to lavish not only government funding but private sector.</p>
<p>We have some huge opportunities in the future and I hope the new minister recognizes that we have some opportunities that are before us soon that I think will really transform our creative economy here and really put us where we deservedly should be, on a high pedestal for not only national but international recognition of our cultural identity here in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I'm going to go quickly to some of the things that I thought should have been in the Speech from the Throne that I didn't hear. Of course, being a former paramedic and working through Opposition into the benches of government and being the first Minister of Communities, Culture, and Heritage, I had the great opportunity after that to become the Health and Wellness Minister. Not an easy job and I think another group that we could start is former Health Ministers, and share stories and experiences. It's a challenging job. We all know and I think Nova Scotians know that the most important thing to them is health care. I know we just fought a campaign on many different areas but if you spend any time with Nova Scotians you recognize how important health care and the health care services are to them.</p>
<p>What concerned me here in the Throne Speech - I'll accept that we have a difference of opinion when it comes to the health authorities and health administration of our system here in Nova Scotia. I know the Minister of Health and Wellness and the Liberal Party campaigned on reducing the number of health authorities across the province to two. I will admit now that it was something that I was supportive of for many years but as I learned a little bit more about some of the past experiences that I've seen, read about, and talked to ministers who have gone through that exercise, I realize that you have to be very careful.</p>
<p>In the campaign the Liberal Party said that they were going to save millions of dollars by reducing the number of health authorities in Nova Scotia to two. You don't have to look too far to see how that hasn't really worked out. In our neighbouring Province of New Brunswick you actually saw a spike, at one point, of health administration costs. The Province of Alberta went from one - or I think they had 10 or 11 - to one super board and there were many, many issues when they did that. A lot of funds were diverted from front-line health care to pay off high executive pays and severance pays, and that concerns me. I think any money that is going to be diverted from the health care system to pay someone to leave should be a concern of all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>We have a number of VPs; we have a number of health chairmen or CEOs of the health authorities who do some very good work. People need to realize we need health administrators in our health care system. We need them there to make sure that we can implement changes to improve services. Some of the services that we've improved over the last number of years, I think, have had a positive effect on Nova Scotians, things like the Collaborative Emergency Centres.</p>
<p>When we came into government there was a chronic issue of emergency room closures, especially rural communities, across Nova Scotia and there had to be something done, something different. I would hope that the Minister of Health and Wellness and the government recognize and work with those emergency centres that have converted to Collaborative Emergency Centres. I believe it has - and the data has shown that it has - improved the closure rates of emergency rooms across the province. We were very upfront to say that this collaborative model of care and this change in model of care won't be the fit for every hospital around.</p>
<p>I know the Minister of Health and Wellness has a hospital in his area that is seeing closure rates. He's been on his feet many times telling me about every single one of those closures, but the collaborative emergency model wouldn't work there, the hospital in his area, because it's too large. These are meant for smaller, rural hospitals, maximizing the skill sets of the health care providers that are in those areas. I really hope that is an area that the new government will continue to look at, continue to support, and continue to expand, because you don't have to take my word for it.</p>
<p>I know I was one of the ministers working to implement those changes, along with the former minister prior to me, the member for Halifax Needham, but we've had jurisdictions across the country come to Nova Scotia and adopt this system and this model of care, and it's not through one Party. We had the Liberal Government in P.E.I. who has come over, and now I believe the first Collaborative Emergency Centre is open in Alberton, Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>We've worked collaboratively with them on a number of health initiatives, like the 811 system for example. They utilize our 811 system. We have the Conservative Government - no, it's the Saskatchewan Government, from Saskatchewan, because it's the Saskatchewan Party - who came here, and now they have Collaborative Emergency Centres in Saskatchewan. There are a number of jurisdictions that are looking at that model of care, and I hope that the government will recognize the importance of continuing to support that change in model of care.</p>
<p>One of the other positive things that I haven't heard in the Speech from the Throne, initiatives that have happened over the last number of years - and I hope the government continues to support them - is the increase in the Children's Dental Program, for example, something that we needed to support as a former health care provider. Good oral health care lends to good health care overall, and it's important for our kids to have a good support system around the dental program.</p>
<p>The other area which I was very proud to be part of was the insulin pump program for children and young adults. I think all Parties supported that initiative as we brought it forward, because diabetes - it's so important to make sure that individuals, especially young people, have good control of that disease, because that can allow an individual to have so many complications. If you can regulate diabetes well, then I think you are less dependent on the health care system for those complications from that.</p>
<p>We also realized there is a cost to the health care system on Nova Scotians. We do have universal health care coverage, but that doesn't cover everything. That's some of the areas over the last number of years that I've heard, and maybe members throughout the Chamber have heard, that people are concerned with. So dental was one of them. Under the Canada Health Act there's no requirement for provinces to provide a dental program for people, for their residents, but we know how important that is. That's why we had an established program and we've expanded it. I hope the government recognizes that they need to look and there has to be some energy around those services not covered under the Health Act.</p>
<p>Hearing aids and eyeglasses are just a number of them that I know came up through our campaign and knocking on doors, especially seniors who go without hearing aids, because they are expensive. How expensive they are was brought to light in different media stories and shows. I believe you can manufacture hearing aids pretty cheaply, but I don't think anybody gets off without paying over $2,000 for a set of hearing aids. Eyeglasses, too. We need to try to see how we can ensure that Nova Scotians, especially our seniors, continue to have access to those types of services.</p>
<p>The other thing that we are grateful for here in Nova Scotia, and I hope we continue to see it into the future, is doing studies and trying to improve the health care delivery through trying new techniques. One of the recent studies we did, and it was out of Cape Breton, was the use of a clot-busting drug, or TNK, during heart attacks. We were the first jurisdiction here in North America, and I believe around the world, that did a study on what the outcomes of someone who was having a heart attack would be if they received that medication in their homes instead of waiting until they went to the hospital. The results were amazing, so of course we implemented the first-ever, clot-busting drug program that paramedics and ambulances across the province now have in their ambulances to give to people who have heart attacks. It has saved lives.</p>
<p>I think that's a great example of how we could contribute to changes in health care that will come in the future. We have a good size where you can do those trials, like this one in Sydney, but even in Halifax and throughout different parts of the province. I hope the government recognizes that we need to continue on down that path. That is what concerns me in the Speech from the Throne - it was very light, not giving much vision or information on some of those issues that are so important to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>It's more than just break the monopoly of Nova Scotia Power. I know that has been the hot issue for the last couple of months, maybe the last year, but there are many more issues out there that the current government needs to start addressing. They need to tell Nova Scotians how they're going to address it over their mandate over the next four years. I was disappointed that some of that information wasn't here in the Speech from the Throne. That will be our role, in Opposition, over the coming years, to hold them accountable and make sure that they tell Nova Scotians exactly what their vision is, how they're going to do it, and how they're going to implement it.</p>
<p>One of the areas in health care that I was most disappointed in without really hearing anything in this was around mental health and addiction. Mental health and addiction here in our province have had a lot of attention over the last year but over the last decade or two it's an area that nobody wants to speak about or talk about. I believe, knowing government, we had an opportunity, we brought forth good initiatives; we brought forward the first mental health addiction strategy that the province ever had. I was a little disappointed that we didn't hear more in the Speech from the Throne on the direction of that.</p>
<p>Yes, there's a strategy in place now but we know and we were restricted financially at times to try to support mental health and addiction services more than we did over the last four years. It's an area that the current Minister of Health and Wellness and the Liberal Government have to pay some attention to. I hope that just because there's not much in this Speech from the Throne, that they will spend some time and energy and funds to increase the services of mental health and addiction here for Nova Scotians. It's extremely important and we don't have to look too far in the past to some of the cases that we're all well aware of. It's an area that we need to continue to support.</p>
<p>In closing, Madam Speaker, I take my roles and responsibility very seriously, as the MLA for Sackville-Cobequid, as an Opposition member. I was here a long time so I know what they said and many of the front benches were there. As the member for Argyle-Barrington said to me at one point when he kind of did that little circle leaving from minister to critic - I know the questions the Minister of Health and Wellness asked me over the last number of years. I might have to just go through it and dust some of them off and throw them back at him. I don't think I'll get a better answer than he received, but time will tell.</p>
<p>With that, Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to stand and have a few brief words in the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable Minister of Energy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4fbcc786-c835-4a0e-bd05-40afb30e0683"><from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from><p>I certainly welcome this opportunity to talk about energy issues. It's always exciting to have the opportunity to talk about my portfolio and about the importance of energy rates to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The Maritime Link is an important part of our energy plan here for this province as we work towards the lowest, fairest rates for Nova Scotians. As I travelled the province over the last number of weeks on our energy tour with the honourable member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville, we had the opportunity to engage with a large number of Nova Scotians and over and over they said, it's great that first of all you're coming to our communities and talking about the issues and secondly, we welcome that opportunity to learn more about the Maritime Link.</p>
<p>There have been some questions raised here this afternoon and in previous Question Periods and directly from Nova Scotians. I've heard there's a lot of interest in the importance of the Maritime Link. I know one of the questions that has been asked that's on Nova Scotians' minds, whether the Liberal caucus is supportive of the Maritime Link as government is, I've been trying to figure it out, some days they're supportive of it and some days they're not. It's a little bit of a flip-flop to try to figure out exactly are they supportive or are they not? It's hard to know what their mind is thinking on any particular day. In fact, I want to mention that the Leader of the Opposition - I know a few years back he flew to Newfoundland and Labrador to lobby for the Lower Churchill, for the Maritime Link.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to go on-line and Google the Lower Churchill and the Liberal Party and see what would come up. There were a number of interesting things there that did come up. Again, is the Party in favour of the project? Are they supportive of the project or not? One thing I found, it said that "Lower Churchill Crucial to Nova Scotia's Energy Future." Okay, that seems supportive on that particular day, I think it was February 14, 2012 the Leader of the Liberal Party had said that. On another day he had this to say, "Lower Churchill Deal Bad for Nova Scotians", so it's just the opposite on that particular day and that was on July 31, 2012.</p>
<p>Again, it's hard to figure out which one they're supporting. Then on August 13, 2010, the Liberal Leader said that as Leader of the Opposition "Supports Energy Minister's Position On Lower Churchill." It's sort of wishy-washy, one day they're supporting it, one day they're not. I'll table that. It's very difficult to figure out what the Liberal Party position is on the Maritime Link and the Lower Churchill. That's the evidence right there.</p>
<p>Maybe the member opposite that spoke before me can tell us whether he supports a made-in-Atlantic-Canada solution to our energy problems or whether they're going to continue to support Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec. I've heard a lot about their energy plan that supports Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec from that province and I know there has been direct contact between the Liberal Party and Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec so I don't know what their energy plan is, but I'll leave it for the public to decide whether they're more supportive of an Atlantic Canadian project or of a Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec project.</p>
<p>We've heard loud and clear from Nova Scotians that they want change and that the status quo was no longer acceptable. For far too long we've relied in this province on coal - on dirty, imported, polluting coal - and we believe it's time to get away from the past and take some action, to have a plan of action for this province. The inaction that occurred over a number of years under previous administrations has to end.</p>
<p>I know that Nova Scotians have a lot of questions about the Maritime Link Project, as part of our energy plan in this province. We think it's one of the most ambitious projects that has ever been undertaken here in Atlantic Canada, and that it really has the potential to change our energy future for generations to come. The Maritime Link is going to create thousands of good jobs for Nova Scotians and Maritimers and Atlantic Canadians.</p>
<p>We've already had expert witness testimony from John Dalton of Power Advisory Inc. that it is the best value for ratepayers. He's an energy expert. His reputation relies on his professional opinion. He appears before public utilities around eastern North America, and he has to defend what he comes up with. In his opinion this project with the Maritime Link is the lowest-cost option for Nova Scotians. It's more than $400 million cheaper than the <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b> option, and it's actually about $1.5 billion cheaper than relying on natural gas and wind.</p>
<p>In addition, Nova Scotians will not only get the lowest-cost option because of his evidence, but the federal government is onside with this project as well. They have come up with a federal loan guarantee that will save Nova Scotians more than $100 million. So there are many positives about the Maritime Link, including greenhouse gas emission targets that will be met. In addition, it will put us in an energy loop that will allow us to use energy from other jurisdictions - whether it's New Brunswick, Quebec, or New England - but it will allow us to bring in energy at market rates that will allow us truly to compete on the continental scale.</p>
<p>I mentioned our energy tour. I had the pleasure of visiting a number of communities from Bridgewater and Antigonish, Sydney, the Pictou area, Port Hawkesbury, and as well, my ministerial assistant hosted a number of sessions in Yarmouth, Amherst, and Guysborough. So we heard from more than 500 Nova Scotians as we travelled the province, and they were pleased to hear that we had a very diverse portfolio, part of which is the Maritime Link. Part of our plan for energy in this province is local energy, reliable energy. It's tax-free energy, it's green, and it's efficient, and those are part of our reliability on a diverse source of energy in this province.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, I think we finally have a government and a Leader with experience and a plan, a vision, to lead our province forward on energy issues. I know that some Opposition members would prefer it if we relied simply on <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b>, but we don't believe that's the only option out there. We're on the verge of a very historic opportunity here in the province, with an opportunity with our sister province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and it has been described truly as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>The Maritime Link is an affordable, secure, made-in-Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canada energy plan which will provide us with the lowest, fairest rates for generations to come. I believe that as a government we are doing everything to ensure that Nova Scotia understands the details of the project. Our government wants to ensure this project offers the best option for our energy future, so we've asked an independent body, the Utility and Review Board, to undertake a thorough public review of the Maritime Link proposal. The six-month URB hearing process is an important step that will ensure Nova Scotians receive all of the information they require in relation to the Maritime Link/Lower Churchill project in a timely fashion. The URB will make an informed decision. They'll make an impartial decision based on the best evidence they have, based on the expertise that is available to them, whether it's John Dalton of Power Advisory or Emera's witness testimony or whether it's any other expert they require to come in to present the evidence to them.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we introduced the Maritime Link Act regulations, and all Parties in this House had the opportunity to debate that. Last Spring the bill was here and it was supported unanimously - the Liberal caucus supported it, the Progressive Conservative caucus supported it and, in fact, some of them wanted to say it was even their idea to bring it forward. So we were thankful for that support and showed that all Parties supported the idea of hydroelectricity from Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>I want to mention the one support that we appreciated hearing from was from the member for Argyle. The honourable member at that time, in May of last year, had this to say, "I think all Parties in this House have spoken to this issue on a number of occasions now. I can say that our Party will be supporting this bill because it is something we've talked about for a really long time as well." So, Madam Speaker, I want to table that as support from the Progressive Conservative Party, and we thank them for their support.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the member for Dartmouth East was also supportive of the Maritime Link Act when it was passed in this Legislature last May. He said, "I think we'll certainly support this bill &#x2026;" and "My hope would be that the minister and the Premier would actually be willing to consult with the Opposition Parties on some of the issues that should be covered in that, or even if they ultimately don't agree with this, at least if the minister and the Premier would seek out our feedback in terms of what issues should be covered by those regulations. We would certainly appreciate that opportunity and we hope the minister and the Premier would do so." That was a direct quote from the Energy Critic for the Liberal Party and, again, I'll table that as well.</p>
<p>You know, Madam Speaker, our government has supported the Maritime Link not only here in the House but also there was an opportunity for draft regulations that were put out to the public to see what comment we'd get from the general public on the Maritime Link. That comment period was from July 16<sup>th</sup> until August 3<sup>rd</sup> of last year, and we encouraged Nova Scotians to come forward and tell us what they thought of the hearing process in support of the Maritime Link Act. Really, it was an open and transparent process and all interested groups could come forward and tell us what they thought.</p>
<p>We received nine comments from that regulatory hearing time in midsummer last year. There were a number of opportunities for non-profit groups and individuals to tell us what they considered were important before the regulations were finalized. The regulations did set out a six-month timeline for the Maritime Link URB hearing process and they were drafted with input certainly from the URB.</p>
<p>I want to point out, Madam Speaker, that there was something missing - we did not hear during that regulatory review period from either of the Opposition Parties. We did not hear from the Liberal caucus; we did not hear from the Progressive Conservative caucus during that regulatory review period in July and August of last year, so I assumed that they were happy with the timelines, with the period that was available to the URB to review the process on the Maritime Link on the Lower Churchill project. Certainly they had that opportunity. There were nine submissions received from the general public - not one from either Opposition Party.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Opposition Parties say there's not enough time here, but they were given lots of time during the regulatory review last summer to have their say if they felt 180 days, or half a year, was not sufficient for the URB to review this process and to make a decision. I don't know, perhaps they were on summer vacation at that time, I'm not sure, but they didn't come forward with any suggestions on the regulatory rules that were laid out. We believe that half a year time frame is the right length of time and that decision is not going to change.</p>
<p>There has also been the complaint there has been too much information that has come forward during the review process, and in many ways, Madam Speaker, that's misleading because a lot of that information that was out there is in public documents, public information. It has been available now for months to look at. As an example, the Atlantic Energy Gateway Studies is part of the material that was laid out there and that has been available on the Department of Energy's Web site for months now to look at. Certainly we support the Atlantic Energy Gateway initiative and working in co-operation with our neighbours in Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. So a lot of it is not new material and we feel what the Opposition is saying here really is a red herring, that a lot of that material was already available to people long before the hearing came along.</p>
<p>I know my time is limited, but we believe that the half-year period is sufficient time to review the material that's available, to cross-examine and to get the information that's required. Really, they have up until May 27<sup>th</sup> before the public hearing process starts.</p>
<p>Again, in closing, I thank you for the opportunity here to talk about the Maritime Link, which is going to provide us with the lowest-cost option for Nova Scotians and the lowest and fairest rates for the people of this province, and I'm looking forward to the day when power is switched on from the Lower Churchill project. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>It was interesting to hear the minister's comments there a few minutes ago when he began, if I can quote him to some degree and I'll get the key point of it here, when he started his comments a few minutes ago he talked about Nova Scotians having the fairest rates and the lowest fairest rates for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The debate really is a lot of this debate and the ongoing debate has been exactly that point. We've not yet heard what the rates will be. There are a lot of things we do know though, so I'm going to touch on a few of the things we do know. I'll come back to what we know about the rates - or what we don't know, I should say.</p>
<p>What we do know is people are still struggling today and have been struggling for some time to pay their high cost of power. We hear from them on a regular basis - I'm sure in your constituency you probably hear from the odd one as well, if not lots of them. I know where I come from we hear from quite a few of them and you can almost pinpoint the day in the week when you're going to hear from them, and that's the week they're reminded when that bill comes and they go, wow, yet another increase.</p>
<p>In January, when we saw the increase and the bills came in the new year, people were upset. We heard from a lot of people and they're asking, how is it possible that this is fair to Nova Scotians, to us as ratepayers?</p>
<p>The minister also spoke a few minutes ago about his energy tour, he was travelling around the province and getting input, and you know he has travelled all over the province and he's saying 500 people - what do we have living in this province? We're just shy of one million - 425,000 households? So, that says right there that there are at least 425,000 or more ratepayers in this province who are paying a power bill. You have small business, you have big business, and we've heard from them, all categories - there's nobody left out there.</p>
<p>What we do know is businesses are closing because they can't afford to stay in this province and pay the power bills. Businesses are laying people off. We know the economy has been bad; we know it's tough times in this province. We've just been making it tougher by seeing increases - a 30 per cent increase in the last few years in power bills alone, let alone all of the other things that businesses and individuals for that matter and ratepayers and taxpayers, and trying to manage a household have to maintain. The cost of food has gone up, everything has gone up. We know that. Everything has gone up.</p>
<p>They are saying we cannot sustain high power rates. We cannot continue to have rate increases and what we do know is that they just went up another 3 per cent in January, where the guaranteed increase again coming which will be here before we know it unfortunately - it will be January 2014 with another guaranteed rate increase. We've heard talk about guaranteed rate increases for the next decade - what will that mean? It doesn't attract anybody here; it certainly doesn't attract business, number one.</p>
<p>There's no reason for people - I talk to people all the time, young people getting out of school, another one the other day, a friend of mine, where is he going? He's going to Alberta to work and travel back because his family's here. I said, are you going to stay in Nova Scotia with your family and travel back and forth? If I can, but I might have to move because I don't know if that's going to work. There are so many scenarios like that - these are real scenarios.</p>
<p>We heard other members talk about the experts and the advocates and so on, but you know who the real experts are? The real experts, along with all those people, are those people paying that bill every month or every two months. Those are the ratepayers, the taxpayers in the Province of Nova Scotia; they are the experts to know whether it's good or bad for them. We can all stand in this House and speak as we wish about there not being enough time - you know what? Time is of the essence, yes, to some degree here, it is.</p>
<p>We could debate time until time is no more. We'll not agree. We already know that, that's just the way this place works, unfortunately. The taxpayers, the ratepayers - same people - they're tired of that; they're tired of those games. They want to see government step up to the plate and do what is right. When they talk about this energy link to Newfoundland and Labrador, they look at it and go, well, we don't really know what to think. There has been a lot of debate. You go to the coffee shops, you talk to people in your office, you talk to your family, you talk to everyday people on the street, and they will make very good points. Some will support it. Some will say, what's the right answer? Some will say, what's it going to cost? Most importantly, people need to know what it's really going to cost. That's really the big piece here.</p>
<p>We've asked many times and the minister knows this, he's no stranger to this question - what will the cost be? Maybe he and the Premier and somebody else know the cost over the course of 35 years or more, what this means. You can't take lightly 35 years. Think about that - how much change is in the world in 35 years. A lot changes in 35 years. A lot can change. Technology, the development of other kinds of energy sources out there. We've been talking tidal out there in my backyard in the Minas Basin. We've all heard the story: we're waiting for better technology to help create that. We know that could be powerful. Thirty-five years is a long time to lock us into something that we don't know the cost of.</p>
<p>We have heard stories about loading it on the front end and having better rates and paying more on the back end, and vice versa, or it's wide open. It sounds like the power company has a variety of options. Maybe that's part of the deal with government and how they plan to make that all work. I'm not really sure. I'm not sure if anybody is sure. I'm not sure if they're sure, but for 35 years to lock us in, we know that people are going to be upset about that. They're already upset about the very thought of it.</p>
<p>They looked at Newfoundland and Labrador - and there are a lot of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians living in the Province of Nova Scotia. A lot of folks who come from there remember the deal over there. It's an emotional piece in Newfoundland and Labrador and what has happened between them and Quebec. We all know that. They look at that and go, yes, this could be good for Newfoundland and Labrador. We've heard that brought up as well. Maybe it is. Maybe it is good for Nova Scotia, but when you're signing a deal and you don't know what it means on the dotted line, what you're paying for, what you're buying, they look at the link itself.</p>
<p>They are going to pay for all these years, and then they're going to say, oh, we don't own that. That's like taking out a mortgage on a home, paying for 25, 30, 35 years - never living in the house, by the way; letting someone else live in it and not pay you anything is a good example of that - and then saying, you can have it, it doesn't really matter to us, my investment has been of no value whatsoever. The benefit to that person, the ratepayer, the taxpayer is - there is no answer to that point. We have not yet heard what the real costs are.</p>
<p>I think if the real costs came out, if we knew and we were doing some comparable analysis as to what wind might be or potential tidal might be or other opportunities to bring energy, gas perhaps might be - we still hear about coal, and more recently it has been, we want to get off coal. Yes, at some point probably we're talking about that, but the reality is we've heard other experts say that coal is going to be around for quite a few years. We talk about economic development and creating jobs in this province. Have we ever thought about our own coal? It's there. Yes, it might cost a little more to get it out, but you know, you're putting people to work. Or we could just give away a few hundred million dollars - for what?</p>
<p>We do need to figure out the job piece, and the minister did say a few minutes ago - I did hear him quite clearly; I think I wrote it down - thousands of jobs will be created. (Interruptions) Where? Good question. Where will the jobs be created? In Newfoundland and Labrador? Good point, maybe. I guess there would be some jobs creating that link. It would have to be built and it would have to be put in the water. I guess there is some stuff that would have to be done on the Cape Breton end. There would be, I suppose, some infrastructure that would have to be upgraded along the lines.</p>
<p>What are we doing? We're spending a lot of money, and here's one fact that we do know: this project started out at one price, and before it's even off the ground and one nail is driven in anything, or one shovel is in the ground, $2 billion has already been added. How do we think we're going to manage this? I wonder how Newfoundland and Labrador think they're going to manage this debt.</p>
<p>When I talk to people from Newfoundland and Labrador who have moved here, and people who still live there, they're saying, well, it's all going to go on the provincial debt. Where else are you going to get $10 billion, $11 billion, $12 billion, $13 billion, $14 billion, $15 billion? It has to go on the provincial debt, but they see it as an investment to some degree, I suppose, and will be well debated. We'll see what the end result will be, whether they support that totally or they don't.</p>
<p>I think as governments change, ideas change. There's any number of options that could change, and that's one of the other fears I think we, as Nova Scotians, have to take into consideration when we look at this deal. Here we are. We know we're going into an election sometime soon. I think that's probably fair to say. I'll even be realistic and I'll say within the next year we're probably going to be into an election. Well, that's fine. Perhaps the government is in a rush because they want to make sure all is said and done in their mandate, and they get this deal off the ground, or into the water, or whatever the right terminology might be here in this one. But let's not rush it, let's take the time, and the minister spoke, well there's been a fair bit of time, and we've got until May, and there's been this opportunity and that opportunity. We've made clear our position, you know, Mr. Speaker, on this whole ordeal, that we should be seeking out everything that is good.</p>
<p>But what we are forgetting are those experts that I talked about a few minutes ago. Those experts, Mr. Speaker, are Nova Scotia ratepayers. Those are the real experts. We have all kinds of great people behind the scenes that are referenced as experts who will put forward their letters, and their support and they'll ask - the Consumer Advocate people that are there, and a variety of groups, all good people, all doing the right thing, and they're there intervening for the right reasons, too. Wouldn't it be amazing to see 200 or 300 or 400, or 1,000 Nova Scotians come forward and tell their stories, because their stories are real stories. Those stories are people putting food on the table. These aren't words that are just said. Or, am I going to pay my power bill or have it cut off? I know one woman who had her power bill cut off, because she couldn't afford to pay for it, and the unfortunate part is, they got a heavy rain and her sump pump couldn't kick in and her house flooded. I mean, it just keeps going on and on and on. That's just one story, one simple story from thousands - hundreds of thousands - of ratepayers.</p>
<p>We need to figure out - the minister's quote - the lowest, fairest rates for Nova Scotians. We're okay with that. We do agree with the lowest, fairest rates, and we've even put forward some ideas in this House, Mr. Speaker, we've put forward legislation. We're the only Party, by the way, that have stood up in this place, and anywhere else in public, and we've said, we'll freeze the power rates. Because we've done the math, we know how to do the math, and we know we can do that, while we assess, and reassess, and take a better look, and get energy from the sources that can provide it at the best rates for Nova Scotians. We don't care where it comes from. If the deal is the right deal, we're going to reach out to anybody who wants to supply energy, in this province and to this province. We believe you have to do that because that's what ratepayers want.</p>
<p>You talk to them, Mr. Speaker. You have them in your constituency, I'm sure that everybody's not thrilled that power rates have gone up since January, and they're not thrilled that they're going to go up again. I'm sure you have to hear from them just like the rest of us do. This is no shock. They want to hear you say, we want to work for you, and we want to be able to bring you the best rates. And you talk about confusion, and that's fair. As I said a few minutes ago, people will be confused because they don't know. We're so deep into the detail. You need to keep it high level, and you need to say, look, this is a good deal because - and the because part that's missing is, this is going to be the cost. We need to know it.</p>
<p>It's only right that you invest in what is fair and long term for Nova Scotians. We don't have a problem with that. We agree with the minister on those comments, but there's a piece he's left out. Again, if the Minister of Energy, and the Premier, or anyone else in Cabinet, or government, or on that side, or Nova Scotia Power, or anywhere for that matter, can give the price - give it. Tell Nova Scotians what it is, let Nova Scotians have a say. Don't just travel around the province, you know, Mr. Speaker, in all honesty, great thing. The minister's going around and he's holding his round tables, he's got 500 Nova Scotians out, but yet he's not told any of them what the price will be.</p>
<p>How can they actually buy in and say, that's a good, low, fair, long-term, secure price for us, when he hasn't given it? If it's there to give - or projected, even, somewhere close. Can you tell us that, we think that this is what it's going to be? But better yet, we need a guarantee because we're going to spend a lot of money. We are asking ratepayers for a lot of money to invest. And I think that they would, the people in this province are smart. They would invest wisely. They want to invest wisely. They want to invest for the long-term. They want to know that that rate exists for them, that it is long-term, that it is fair. That's only reasonable. I think that if you're looking for that buy-in, you could get it. But you have to be transparent. You have to be upfront. You have to tell people what really matters, because it does matter to them. These are the people who are debating, should I stay, or should I go?</p>
<p>My daughter is going to university next year. I said to her, where are you going to go when you're done? Don't know. I want her to think about staying in Nova Scotia and being a teacher. That's what I want her to do. I want her to raise her family here. Why? Because that's good for our province. If there are real jobs to be had, then let's put jobs out there. Let's develop other energy sources that may be acceptable, that may be affordable, may be a long-term good investment, let's put Nova Scotians to work. And if people in this House, right here, Mr. Speaker, the people's House, don't think that jobs and the economy are important to people in this province, let me tell you, it's number one.</p>
<p>People are worrying about their jobs. They're worrying about long-term sustainability. They are very concerned about what the words long-term mean. They want to stay here, they want to raise their families here. They can't do it and they won't do it, and more of them, especially the young people, are standing up and saying we're getting out of here. We can't do it because we don't know, we want jobs, and they are not here. If you want me to stay in the Province of Nova Scotia certain things have to be guaranteed - good housing markets, good prices for this, good prices for that. Certainly when it comes to the end of the month and paying their bills they need to be able to pay those bills. The energy bill, we know, is going in the wrong direction. We need to do more for the real experts in the Province of Nova Scotia and that is the Nova Scotia ratepayers.</p>
<p>With that Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity this afternoon.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Timberlea-Prospect.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fb056af3-dde5-4552-a4b9-b0fc5561ff48"><from>MR. IAIN RANKIN</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker, let me just say, first and foremost, congratulations to you. This is the first night for the opportunity for you to preside over this House, so I just want to give you that recognition. (Applause)</p>
<p>It is truly an honour to rise in this House of Assembly and reply to the Speech from the Throne. I just wanted to mention a couple of people from my campaign. It's going to be hard to mention everyone, but two in particular would be my friend, Jacob Killawee, who served intermittently as my campaign manager - we had a small team, but a mighty team and Jacob was there since day one when I started going door-to-door for my nomination process - and also to my father, Councillor Reg Rankin, who was there to show me how to truly win an election. And it was basically by going to the doors and going out and meeting the people in their kitchens and living rooms and not taking any voters for granted - it certainly worked for him throughout the last seven successful elections.</p>
<p>I grew up in a political family who participated in this process dating as far back, in this country, to 1882, from what I could find out, and that's when my great-great Uncle Angus McLennan represented Inverness in this Assembly as a Progressive Conservative member, and following that (Applause) There's more though, he actually did see the light and crossed the floor (Applause) and served as a Member of Parliament under Laurier's Liberal Government from 1896 to 1908.</p>
<p>Tha e a' cuir urram orm a bhith bruidhinn dhuibh uile san Taigh Honorach seo.</p>
<p>Thainig an teaghlach agam dhan sg&#xEC;re seo bho 'n t-seann duthaich. Tha cultar na Gaidhlig gu math l&#xE0;idir fhathast.</p>
<p>Tha an teaghlach agam air a bhith a' brosnachadh cultar na Gaidhlig airson uine mh&#xF2;r: Coibhneas, Ce&#xF2;l, C&#xE0;nan 's iomadh rud eile. Tha mi 'n dochas gun c&#xF9;m sinn oirnn an sar-sheann chultar seo a bhrosnachadh; fear dhe na pr&#xEC;omh cultar dhen sg&#xEC;re againn.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I speak those few words in Gaelic not only for the interests of my own heritage, but to underscore the importance of the celebration of any and all family backgrounds - and I'm very honoured to serve alongside so many different backgrounds in this House.</p>
<p>I think we all recognize the pressing importance of promoting an intelligent, creative entrepreneurial immigration strategy. If not, consider that every day some 30 Nova Scotians reach the age where they begin to draw from CPP, so that is approximately 1,000 people every month entering into the senior cohort. This government must seek to begin to arrest the trend in Nova Scotia of declining government revenues and increasing expenditures. We must get creative and adapt, as we do in the business world. We must be frugal with every government dollar and we must look to newcomers to help, as we did following World War II, when many immigrants contributed so much to turn our economy around.</p>
<p>Je voudrais dire qu'il est tr&#xE8;s important de prot&#xE9;ger et promouvoir les langues qui existent maintenant dans notre province. Prot&#xE9;ger et mettre en valeur les langues ne peut que nous fournir &#xE0; la fois une meilleure compr&#xE9;hension du pass&#xE9; et des avantages pour l'avenir.</p>
<p>&#xC0; l'instar de tout le Canada, la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse a connu un grand succ&#xE8;s &#xE9;conomique dans un pass&#xE9; r&#xE9;cent en acceptant que l'immigration est n&#xE9;cessaire. Apr&#xE8;s la deuxi&#xE8;me guerre mondiale, beaucoup des gens sont venus des pays d'Europe et ont contribu&#xE9; &#xE0; dynamiser notre &#xE9;conomie et &#xE0; construire une meilleure soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.</p>
<p>La pr&#xE9;servation des langues parl&#xE9;es par nos concitoyens nous procure &#xE9;galement une meilleure compr&#xE9;hension de la n&#xE9;cessit&#xE9; d'accueillir les gens d'autres cultures &#xE0; bras ouverts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, forming partnerships with municipalities, the federal government and neighbouring provinces can only help build prosperity. Like in any business, economies of scale can be realized and redundancy can be mitigated when we find ways to work together.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, today we have a merged lottery system in Atlantic Canada - perhaps we can find similar savings by looking at other government agencies that are duplicated in provinces with less than the population you find in our major cities.</p>
<p>It was great to hear tonight the honourable Minister of Energy talking about a strategy to co-operate with the other Atlantic Provinces, and also the member opposite, just before me mentioning how the 811 number was used to collaborate with P.E.I. in Health. I think we can do a lot more of those collaborative agreements.</p>
<p>Augmented buying power can be realized by purchasing pharmaceuticals in bulk, and trade barriers between our small provinces can be relaxed for greater mobility of goods and services. I believe the future of our prosperity relies on co-operatively celebrating our own evolving culture, attracting new people to Nova Scotia, and collaborating with neighbouring provinces that face virtually the same obstacles that we do.</p>
<p>We start off, as many governments do, with the platitudes of getting along and working co-operatively for the greater good. Sensationalizing the positions of a new government at the start of a session is common practice in politics, an attempt to set the bar very high. After all, these are the same people who said during the campaign that we had no new promises. So rhetoric aside, let's truly work together as much as possible to reach the outcomes we all want.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I must admit that I'm not a chartered accountant, but I do have experience with financial analysis alongside many CAs I worked with, and I am sanguine about the return on our proposed investments. We will work toward diminishing the out-migration of our young people, increasing immigration, do whatever government can do to rein in the relentless increase in power rates, and perhaps most importantly, reinvest in education. As John F. Kennedy once said more than 50 years ago, before he was president, there is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you about the riding of Timberlea-Prospect, but before I do that I have to mention the member who represented our community for 15 years. Frequently on the campaign trail and after the election I was reminded of the big shoes I have to fill, and rightly so. The Honourable Bill Estabrooks served this House and the people of Timberlea-Prospect with tremendous integrity, and always looked out for what was in the public interest. I intend to follow in that spirit.</p>
<p>Timberlea-Prospect is composed of both rural and urban communities. The Prospect communities have an impressive community centre. This centre serves the many distinct communities along the Prospect Road, most but not all of which are in my riding. The Prospect Road Community Centre is HRM-owned but is managed by a volunteer organization, the Resource Opportunities Centre. The ROC began life as a rural CAP site located in Terence Bay. By working collaboratively with all the other volunteer and non-profit organizations in the area, the ROC helped pave the way to making the PRCC a reality in 2010. Many of the communities in the Prospect area were thriving fishing communities in the past and suffered economically as a result of the fisheries crisis. Many of these communities are also very rich in cultural heritage, having been recognized internationally for their arts and crafts, weaving, rug hooking, woodworking, folk artists, painting, and sculpture. Many of the buildings and institutions which historically supported the cultural activities in the area are no longer in existence.</p>
<p>Shad Bay, at the edge of the riding, is a picturesque linear village where homes have a view of the water and are set on generous lots lining the Prospect Road as it hugs the coastline of the bay. Fish shacks still sit at the water's edge. In the 1930s and 1940s the village had an active fishery, but few residents make their living as fishermen today.</p>
<p>A Shad Bay resident who should be recognized for her outstanding volunteer contribution to community is Rita Mae Schwartz. Rita was a founding member of the Prospect Road Citizens on Patrol, serves on the board of directors for ROC, and now gives her time at the Souls Harbour Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>Continuing toward Halifax, the first community in the first peninsula is called Prospect Bay. From Hages Road in Cedar Court there is access to the trail around the "High Head" lands. This trail provides spectacular views of the rugged shoreline and coastal barrens, and leads hikers into the heart of the Village of Prospect. Approximately 10 kilometres from the main Prospect Road lies Prospect Village, also referred to as Upper Prospect.</p>
<p>On September 29, 2003, Hurricane Juan made landfall in Nova Scotia between Shad Bay and Prospect. It arrived as a Category 1 storm, and Prospect was at the centre of this storm. When day broke the villagers saw destruction of every single wharf and shed, except one small red shed that the Coolen family had in the cove.</p>
<p>Today Prospect is a sleepy little village, fully recovered from Hurricane Juan. Many residents are older and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and the spectacular natural beauty that surrounds them. The Prospect Peninsula Residents Association has been active for decades. They have successfully undertaken a number of huge initiatives such as ownership and management of the community wharf, creating recreational spaces and hosting activities, facilitating a community library, holding annual events for Canada Day and Christmas celebrations, forming the Prospect Players theatre group, and being proactive with regard to land development in the local area. In order to finance a lot of the organization's activities, the PPRA pull on the community at large to help host their annual lobster dinner held each August, involving upwards of 50 volunteers.</p>
<p>As in many small villages, volunteering is a way of life in Prospect. Worthy of recognition are community leaders such as Helga Baxter, Allison Lawlor, Sam Rogers, Jan Morrison, and lifelong resident Ellen Ryan.</p>
<p>Whites Lake, back on the main Prospect Road, is another distinct community. At the junction with the Prospect Bay Road is the Whites Lake Legion, which has been serving the community for decades. Besides being a home for the veterans of the area, there are two seniors' groups that regularly use the facility, that I have visited quite a few times to play crib with. I'm not going to list all the names because some of them would probably be upset with me if I didn't mention their name, but on Monday and Wednesday afternoons seniors get together to enjoy friendship and games in a relaxed and welcoming environment. These groups add to the quality of life for older residents, breaking isolation, forging new friendships, and creating a supportive network for seniors to support each other.</p>
<p>Heading down the next peninsula we enter into the communities of Terence Bay, another distinct community. Miraculously, there are actually six distinct settlements within Terence Bay known as Lower Prospect, Back Bay, Sandy Cove, Terence Bay, Up the River, and Across the River. Many of the families in this area can actually trace their family connections to these lands back for generations.</p>
<p>The Terence Bay Wilderness Area is 11,000 acres, it's coastal and near-coastal wilderness within a rapidly urbanizing portion of HRM. Together with the adjacent Long Lake Provincial Park, it forms nearly a 20-kilometre natural corridor between Spryfield and the Atlantic Ocean. Its lakes, woodlands and coastal environment offer outstanding opportunities for wilderness recreation. Heading down the bay you are treated to incredible scenery. At the top of Back Bay Hill you see the inlets and coves leading to the open ocean.</p>
<p>The <i>SS Atlantic</i> sank on April 1, 1873, off the coastline of Terence Bay and Lower Prospect. The Terence Bay Lighthouse on Tenant Point at the mouth of the bay was built in response to the fatal mistake that led the <i>SS Atlantic</i> into danger. In 1873, with no lighthouse to mark the way, the ship mistook Terence Bay for the approach to Halifax Harbour and sailed full speed in a blinding storm into Mosher Island. Local fisher families helped to rescue the survivors, took them into their homes, and buried the dead who washed ashore. It took local folks a number of years before a proper lighthouse on Tenant Point was built in 1903. The interpretive centre was completed in 2002 containing a small museum of artifacts from the <i>SS Atlantic</i>, interpretive panels, and a craft shop featuring the work of Nova Scotia artisans.</p>
<p>The <i>SS Atlantic</i> society hosts a number of events annually including the Blessing of the Fleet held on the last Sunday in July. The society has many dedicated volunteers. Worthy of note for their commitment and leadership of the society are Valda Kemp, Ann Bartlett, and Shirley and Jim Little.</p>
<p>Returning to the main Prospect Road that connects all of these communities in the area, you travel from Whites Lake into Hatchet Lake, where most of the Prospect population is. This is the location of the Prospect Road Community Centre as well as St. Timothy's Church built in 1961 as part of the St. Philip's Parish. Reverend Lisa Vaughan has worked tirelessly to bring more people and services together for the benefit of her congregation and the community at large. St. Timothy's and St. Paul's have a healthy and active faith community that makes a positive contribution to the community. Examples are the food bank run by Andy Mitchell, and a Divorce and GriefShare facilitated by Reverend Cheryl Rafuse.</p>
<p>Most of the Hatchet Lake population is within the community of Brookside, which continues to grow. The active Brookside Homeowner Association works to increase opportunities for the local population, estimated at approximately 1,500 people. Several members of the BHA should be recognized for their work in the community, including Wayne Hamilton and Valerie Wilson who are strong advocates for Brookside residents.</p>
<p>Heading out of Hatchet Lake towards Halifax, you travel over Long Bog before arriving in Goodwood. Opposite Long Bog is the Old Coach Road that leads through a quiet subdivision to the Indian Lake Golf Course and restaurant. The lands beyond Old Coach Road lead onto the Western Commons lands and link up with the Five Bridges Lakes area. That has now been designated under the Wilderness Areas Protection Act. These lands run between Highway No. 103 to the north and Prospect Road to the south. It extends from Ragged Lake Business Park in the east to the Nine Mile River in the west. The new wilderness area protects about 21,000 acres of near-urban Crown lands between Highway No. 103 and Prospect Road. Just to give you an idea, it's almost five times the size of Halifax Peninsula and it's only minutes away from the city.</p>
<p>Goodwood is a residential area existing side by side with an established industrial area. The industrial area houses businesses such as C&amp;D Recycling, which is Nova Scotia's only tire recycling facility. Other small businesses like Ace Upholstery, operated by Bob Dooley, are in Goodwood itself rather than the industrial area.</p>
<p>When leaving the Prospect Road, you would turn left to enter into the riding again in the urban communities of Beechville, Lakeside and Timberlea. I grew up in these communities during my childhood and school years.</p>
<p>I do want to speak to Beechville specifically because of its historic importance in Nova Scotia as an original indigenous Black community, formerly known as Beech Hill, and before that Refugee Hill. The first settlers were from the southern American colonies seeking refuge from slavery. They were given land grants here for fighting in the War of 1812. In the summer of 2014, Beechville will celebrate its 200<sup>th</sup> Anniversary. The Beechville Baptist Church has played an important role for the community, and there were many community leaders such as the late Reverend Doctor Oliver and the late Deacon Reg Hamilton who were responsible for the planning and construction of the church.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Beechville has changed dramatically in recent years. There is now a modern community called Beechville Estates with a modern school and just over 200 homes, with 30 to 40 languages spoken within the community. It is truly a marvel to meet people from all over the globe in such a concentrated area, the most pluralistic subdivision east of Montreal. My friend Ali Duale lives there with his family - 10 children - and when Ali is not looking after his own kids he's running a sports program for kids who come from all over the world as new Nova Scotians. There are now plans for another subdivision that will likely boast the same level of diversity on the lands opposite, behind Bayers Lake Park.</p>
<p>Lakeside is home to the other Legion within the riding. They also have the riding's only apartment buildings. Further down the St. Margarets Bay Road is Timberlea. There are several subdivisions in Timberlea off the Bay Road. This community started to grow rapidly while I was growing up, and continues to attract many young families. The oldest subdivision in Timberlea is Parkdale, where former county councillor Helena Poirier resides. She was responsible for bringing city water and sewer services to Timberlea in the 1980s. Since then the Timberlea population has more than quadrupled in size. Also, on these lands adjacent to Exit 3 is a championship golf course under construction in Brunello Estates, with plans for over 3,000 homes to add to our communities.</p>
<p>Going further down the Bay Road is the Bluff Wilderness Hiking Trail, rated as one of the best urban escapes in Canada. One of the largest subdivisions is Glengarry Estates, with an active homeowners' association thanks to the community efforts of Ken Hubley, John Feetham and Bob Angus, to name a few. The former CN railroad, which runs from Halifax through BLT and beyond is a popular recreational multi-use trail managed and maintained by volunteers. Timberlea resident Catherine Kelfentz is the chair of the BLT Rails to Trails.</p>
<p>After commuting through Timberlea is the community of Hubley and Upper Tantallon. There are a few active groups who meet regularly at the Hubley Community Centre. Jill Pullsifer and Harry Ward co-chair the Five Bridges Wilderness Heritage Trust, and Richmond Campbell and David Patriquin co-chair the Woodens River Watershed Environmental Organization. The watershed includes all land, habitation and streams that drain into the Woodens River system. The headwaters lie in Hubley. From there, a set of 19 connected lakes flow southwest across the Chebucto Peninsula into the Woodens River and finally into St. Margarets Bay at Woodens Cove in Seabright.</p>
<p>All of these communities are host communities of HRM's landfill off of Exit 3 at a place called Otter Lake. The community agreed to host the landfill on the condition that state-of-the-art facilities were implemented to protect the local environment. A citizen-led stakeholder community was struck to create a strategy, and today the Community Monitoring Committee acts on behalf of its citizens. Recently, unwarranted anxiety has been felt by citizens because of a report written from the direction of HRM staff. The report recommends the closure of Front End Processing and the Waste Stabilization Facility, among other considerations, to save upwards of $10 million of operating expenses.</p>
<p>The conditions of the operating permit are that screening of materials will be provided before waste enters the landfill. All Parties in this House supported the community with this and for that I give my thanks. There is an important vote coming up at HRM Council and I expect council to honour its commitments to my community.</p>
<p>Thank you for permitting me to tell you about the best riding in Nova Scotia and I look forward to representing the many distinct communities I spoke about today.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Kings West.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to join the emergency debate. This is a very important topic to Nova Scotians. Constituents that I talk with and who come to my office are taking notice and they definitely know that there is a great deal to analyze and dissect around this issue. In terms of the debate it is around the fact that the URB has simply too short a timeline of 180 days to allow for submissions and the hearing process to take place. Now I know the Minister of Energy makes light of this and there were other opportunities, and so forth, to present submissions but the real intervening, the real look by the URB is in fact that six-month period and this is very much a moving project that keeps getting additional information added on as we move to the point where the project gets underway and moves towards an anticipated completion date of 2017.</p>
<p>At the present time there are literally thousands of pages of documents that are coming forward that the interveners are gathering, that a wide range of expertise are presenting. With all due respect to the abilities of Mr. Dalton, Mr. Dalton was given an agenda by government to make sure that the Maritime Link and its outcome and the analysis was going to favour the Maritime Link over any other project. In fact, I would like to see all of the monies that Nova Scotia Power and Emera are putting into the Maritime Link, I would like to see them develop true local energy.</p>
<p>Okay, yes, we're part of a region - and Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., and New Brunswick should certainly work together, and greater regionalization can help us all - but I'd like to take a look, and I've mentioned I think at least on one occasion how Germany has become the transformative nation with producing energy. In the year 2000 they had just a handful of companies producing power but they made a policy in the year 2000 that said any German can produce power. Can you imagine allowing the innovators, the risk-takers in Nova Scotia with that kind of a mandate, any of you can produce power. Germany went from a handful of producers to 800 and, of course, the big producers said we're walking on a path to insanity for the big industrial nation of Germany. Well from the year 2000 when they produced three or four per cent renewable energy they've quickly gone to over 25 per cent and by 2015 they'll be at 80 per cent with the nuclear power plants and thermal plants shut down.</p>
<p>I would love to see that kind of opportunity given to Nova Scotians. This would have been a real debate to see how Nova Scotians could respond. But, of course, we have Emera controlling and wanting to control power at least for the next 35 years beyond 2017, by giving us the Nova Scotia ratepayer investing in the project.</p>
<p>It's very interesting that the past estimates put the link at $1.2 billion, but now we know it's going to cost at least $1.5 billion. In fact, during the period of intervening, the 180 days, we're going to find out that a deeper analysis is going to move this project anywhere between $3 billion and $5 billion. My colleague, the member for Hants West was talking about the expertise and the ratepayers, because that is who is going to pay the $3 billion to $5 billion for this project, the financial model, and it puts you and me - it puts us picking up all that cost, all that risk.</p>
<p>In addition, failure of the project to repay the financial responsibilities defers the responsibility on the backs of the Nova Scotia ratepayers, the province, and the federal taxpayers through the federal loan guarantee term sheet. By fencing the project, the financial liabilities of Emera, NSPI, and NSPML are minimal, if any. None of us are financial experts, but this causes me much concern.</p>
<p>The estimates in the application to date are very thin and sketchy. This is why the 180 days needs to be expanded to at least one year, so that this full analysis can be done. Emera at the time of filing did not have any firm numbers on the turnkey contracts for those parts of the project concerning the submarine cable itself, the cable's marine installation, environmental analysis or route surveying of the 200-metre-wide swatch of sea floor, the coastal grounding sites, major conversion stations, switchyard designs, et cetera. Those are going to come out in the hearings, and it's going to be very revealing. There are individuals and companies who have looked at this project for over 25 years. This project is not a year 2000 think process or just in the last four or five years. It has been looked at for many years.</p>
<p>Now, as we approach a start date - potentially a start date - well, I guess it's going to be a start date, because the URB in many ways has lost some of its true power in making a decision on this project.</p>
<p>The reality here, Mr. Speaker, is that when the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party, went and met with Danny Williams, it was indeed about securing a potential deal with Nova Scotia, but the deal was very much in the line of buying power from Newfoundland and Labrador, because we do have to move off the fossil fuel appetite and move toward a greater amount of renewables. When our Leader went there he was talking about what would be the best deal for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>What we have seen over the past four years is our Premier working on the best deal for Emera and for Nova Scotia Power. This is not in any way the best deal for ratepayers. Something happened to our Premier when he flew the Emera jet to Newfoundland and Labrador, because he truly forgot about the average Nova Scotian and what we're paying now for our power bills. In fact, this reference here to the percentage change from 2010 to 2013 is the NDP legacy to Nova Scotians: the highest power rates at 30.3 per cent, outstripping every other province in Canada. I will table that, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>We know that this is going to continue on because the interesting way for Nova Scotia Power to increase the envelope of its monopoly under the ratepayer 9 per cent cushion on market rates for the next 35 years. Approval of this project, if found consistent under the terms of reference of the URB, will tie up any further opportunities for other private sector imports to assist to bring down rates in a Nova Scotia open market for many years.</p>
<p>We all know that where monopolies and when monopolies exist the only way to get the better price, to get the better deal is to provide competition. So in effect this project strengthens Nova Scotia Power's monopoly in this province. The URB also approved the RES and the RFQ approval system for new IPPs to be administered by Nova Scotia Power. This is not any semblance of the original open market design envisioned by Nova Scotia by any of the original Acts or regulations. In many ways Nova Scotia Power wants to have no direct competitors in Nova Scotia's wholesale electricity market for the next 35 years and we know that the NDP is, in fact, enabling Nova Scotia Power and Emera to do just that.</p>
<p>When I talk about Muskrat Falls to constituents and they want to know what my view is, I go back to when I was a high school student in Newfoundland and I heard Joey Smallwood speak about what was going to transform Newfoundland; of course, that was the Upper Churchill Falls development, the creation of Lobstick Lake which would produce about five million kilowatts of electricity, and this would be part of Newfoundland's future economy.</p>
<p>But what we must realize is that during the time of literally no inflation, Newfoundland made a long-term, 69-year deal at the same rate. We may say Quebec should have reopened the deal; well, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador are working out the deal that was made by Smallwood during the time when inflation was pretty well non-existent. So going by today's figures, numbers, and analyses, no it isn't a great deal but it's the deal that Joey Smallwood saw as part of transforming the economy of Newfoundland at that time.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Manitoba Hydro International as they've started to provide some updating on cost analysis have now moved the price tag from $5 billion to $7.7 billion for the entire project - this is a 24 per cent increase in capital costs in just two years. Manitoba Hydro International went on to say - and this is the part that I feel we need to take a look at - they said it was the best deal for Newfoundland and Labrador, and they would not go so far as to say it was even a good deal for Nova Scotia. They projected that benefit to Newfoundland and Labrador from now until the year 2067.</p>
<p>Well, we're not even going to get to the year 2067 because after the 35 years when we get electricity building the Maritime Link we're going to be so generous that we're going to give the Maritime Link back to Newfoundland and Labrador. You can be assured that when 2041 does come, Newfoundland and Labrador and Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec will work out shorter term, more sensible inflationary factors calculated in the next deal and they will continue to move power through Quebec. I feel that Newfoundland and Labrador is going to need the power that will come through the Maritime Link, or a good portion of it, and we are prepared to pay for this, and if electricity does move through the Maritime Link, Nova Scotia may not be one of the contract holders, it may all go into New England. So there is much to think about and to ponder about on this deal.</p>
<p>I believe the interveners should get the required time, not even a set number of days of 180, but simply have an open-ended opportunity for all the interveners to have a true say on whether this is a good deal for our province. Thank you.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#de2082f3-cf3a-4955-8a4e-4f1bf0ac1301"><from>MR. MAT WHYNOTT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to join this debate around the importance of Muskrat Falls to our energy security in our future of this province. I hear many things from the member for Kings West, but I wonder - I know he quoted Manitoba Hydro, but I think he made some assertions there and I wonder if he actually called Manitoba Hydro on the telephone like his Party did with Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec on a whim.</p>
<p>I'm glad to be able to stand here and talk about this and of the importance of this project, the importance of securing a future for our young people, securing a future for energy security and stable rates, something that we haven't had in this province for many, many years.</p>
<p>I had the chance to stand in my place last week in the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, to talk about how in 1977, the Liberal Premier of the day, they switched from having 100 per cent oil generation in Nova Scotia and then moved all to coal; so to speak, they put all of their eggs in one basket. The Liberal Premier of the day said, well, at least it wasn't as much as the utility had asked for. Mr. Speaker, do you know how much power went up in one year alone? Forty-four per cent, in 1977. The history books talked about it, the history books say what happened and we know that is the truth.</p>
<p>Our government has been able to - we've had a lot of issues that are of importance to many Nova Scotians. One in particular, as I go out to the constituency that I have the pleasure of representing, people talk about power rates, absolutely they talk about power rates. In the past we've had governments who haven't looked at the issue, they've just said, well, that's life. One of the things our government won't do is sit by the sidelines, we can't sit by the sidelines anymore, because we are turning the corner. We are turning the corner where we have the ability to create energy that is stable, reliable, tax-free, it's green, it's a made-in-Atlantic-Canada solution.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party says, let's just hand over everything to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, let's do it, or sometimes they may suggest, let's just do natural gas, like they did in 1977, moving from one fossil fuel to another. It begs the question of our energy security in Nova Scotia. The Liberal Party talks about this supposed plan that they have for energy which, in the past - in fact, last week I talked about how it was basically less than a tweet you could do on Twitter, there was no substance to it, there's no substance to the Liberal plan for energy.</p>
<p>When we talk about that, when we talk about the Liberal plan, they never mention the new federal regulations brought down by the federal government around greenhouse gas emissions. They never talk about that. If they had their way, they would just let that go by the wayside and allow Nova Scotia to pay penalties and fines - continue to build coal-fired plants, allowing them to continue to operate in this province.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians don't want that anymore. That was back in the day. Why do you think BC Hydro, Manitoba Hydro, and <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b> all have low rates? Why? It's because (Interruptions) I look forward to hearing the member for Yarmouth stand up in this emergency debate. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Getting back to what I was saying before, this is about having an energy security for this province that we've never had before, getting out of the days of double digit increases where governments - Liberal and Progressive Conservative - would just sit back and let it happen. They voted against removing tax off electricity, off home heating, that last year put $104 million back into the pockets of everyday Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Another very interesting part I want to talk about is the issue of the - obviously, they want to talk about how much it's going to cost. Less than a percentage in the first five years of the project, and over time, the cost will go down. That's what we know. That's exactly what we know: $1.50 to every bill. What this is doing is allowing Nova Scotia to have an energy portfolio not all in one basket - not all in coal.</p>
<p>What we know is that when we do that, we're tied to that one source of energy. For instance, in the last seven years - we know, because it's history - we know that because we've been tied to one source of international fuel, coal. Because we've been tied to that, the price of coal has gone up by 75 per cent on the international market. If we had known that back then, back when we moved from one fossil fuel to another - if we had known that today, because that's what history tells us - hopefully, the government of the day wouldn't have done that. But they did. They went from one fossil fuel to the other.</p>
<p>That's the other reality. At what cost do we move from one fossil fuel or one source of energy to another? Back then, it was all greenhouse gas emissions. For us to sit on the sidelines, the question has to be asked, what's the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost of doing nothing? This is why we need to build an energy mix in our province. Muskrat Falls is just one part of that.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party talks about how this hasn't been analyzed. I heard the member for Halifax Clayton Park getting up and saying this hasn't been analyzed. The government asked a very knowledgeable person by the name of John Dalton to issue a report, to talk about and compare different options, talking about Lower Churchill and comparing the cost to <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b> and then comparing the cost to domestic energy sources, such as natural gas and wind.</p>
<p>What we know, Mr. Speaker, is that if we were to switch 100 per cent of the energy that we need to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, it would cost us $402 million more. That's what John Dalton said. So why would we, as a government, want to have something more, that costs more than what the project of Muskrat Falls is? So that's $402 million more than what is estimated for the overall cost of the project.</p>
<p>We also know that if we went completely to natural gas and wind, that would be $105 billion more. So that's what we know, Mr. Speaker. Lower Churchill and Muskrat Falls, the Maritime Link, will improve our diversity and security of energy, it will improve our regional grid reliability, it will improve regional supply flexibility promoting price competition and it will achieve environmental and clean energy targets.</p>
<p>This is exactly what John Dalton, someone who relies on his own credibility in what he does for a living - to move forward, to bring forward a report that well, you know the experts in the Opposition say, oh well it can't be true.</p>
<p>Talking about energy, I mean this is an important piece of the puzzle, Mr. Speaker, but I want to talk about something that came to us all as MLAs the other day, from Mr. Crandlemire, the CEO of Efficiency Nova Scotia. He talked about what last year, in 2012, Efficiency Nova Scotia was able to achieve with the people of Nova Scotia, able to achieve in energy conservation. In the past we never had an ability to encourage people, to give them the ability to conserve energy in their own home and in their own businesses.</p>
<p>One thing that we do know now, within our Energy portfolio, that about 4.1 per cent of our overall energy was conservation, Mr. Speaker; 4.1 per cent may not seem a lot to the Opposition but it does mean a lot. In fact, we have been able, though Efficiency Nova Scotia that our government created - now I know the Liberals want to get rid of it, if they had their way they would get rid of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, what we do know is that we have been able to help homeowners in their own homes to conserve energy, not only saving them $104 million from taking the tax off home heating, we have been able to save them in 2012 alone, over $100 million in conservation. So if you add those two up, we have over $200 million in savings for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>So we have been able to retire - this is from Efficiency Nova Scotia that every single MLA in this Chamber received an e-mail last week from Efficiency Nova Scotia outlining some of the work that they've done. I know that the member for Preston, when Efficiency Nova Scotia was here during Public Accounts Committee, that he talked about - in fact, Mr. Speaker, I think he even used the words, thank you very much for making life more affordable for people in Nova Scotia. I tabled that in past sessions.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, homeowners, with the help of Efficiency Nova Scotia, have been able to retire 7,976 inefficient, old refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners, Mr. Speaker. Rebates offered on efficient products have resulted in 274,610 products purchased; completed energy efficiency upgrades to 28,397 homes resulted in an average annual saving of $182 per household; 28,397 households received the residential direct install services for low-income families. Why would the Liberal Party want to get rid of that?</p>
<p>In 2012, alone, Nova Scotians saved enough electricity through efficiency programming to power about 16,000 homes; that's in one year alone. We have been able to bring forward an energy plan that will ensure the lowest, fairest rates for Nova Scotians. The Opposition can get up and go on about whatever they want, but this is the truth, this is what Nova Scotians wanted in the government and if the Liberals had their way, my question to the Liberal Party is, if they had their way would they cancel all of these deals? Are they going to cancel Efficiency Nova Scotia? Would they take the HST off home electricity? And, if they had their way, would they cancel the Maritime Link. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Kings North.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#bc54523e-7553-4c28-b315-79d18165339b"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me and a privilege to stand here before you to speak as a newly minted member for Kings North. Many of you will recall that it was by a recount, a 21-vote margin, that I won the race, and I can tell you from my basketball playing days that it's like winning on the last shot, and those are both the most exciting wins to win and the toughest to lose. In saying that I would acknowledge the previous MLA, Jim Morton, in what was a very close race, a very well-fought race, and I know a very tough loss for him. But I feel very honoured and privileged to be here.</p>
<p>Certainly I found that many of my constituents will take credit for being one of those 21 votes; it seems like everyone has said that that was them. Certainly one of the things that was a factor was that I'm a farmer and Kings North likes having a farmer in the Legislature. I don't know how many farmers have been represented in the Legislature in the past, but I believe I'm the only one at the moment. I had the privilege a few days ago of speaking with George Archibald, a previous MLA who was a farmer, so I would like to talk a little bit about that.</p>
<p>My parents came to Canada in 1958 from Holland and they actually lived through the war in Holland. My mother lived through three months of artillery shelling and was liberated by the Canadian Army in 1944. Maybe that was one of the reasons that they came to Canada: that relationship, that special bond that formed between Holland and Canada at that time. My father was a farmer, and in 1987, I was able to take over the farm from him.</p>
<p>We've grown a number of crops over those years and one of the things about Kings North is that 70 per cent of the agriculture of the province is in Kings County, and Kings North certainly represents a big part of that, so I know that world really well so I'm very pleased to be here in that role.</p>
<p>One thing you might not realize about Kings County is that we probably have the most dynamic agricultural economy of any county in Canada. I know that through having been across Canada in many of the other farming counties in my role as a Nuffield scholar. In 1997, I was privileged to be a Nuffield scholar to study agriculture overseas, and one of the ongoing things from that experience was the relationship I had with farmers across the country. So I've been in many of the counties in our great country.</p>
<p>Kings County, as I said, has probably one of the strongest agricultural economies. The reason for that is because we have such a diverse economy. We have chicken farmers, blueberry farmers, wineries, summer savory farmers - as I am - and that is one of things that has led to the strength of the economy there. Also, it has led to sort of a culture of small business and a work ethic in Kings County.</p>
<p>I would like to talk about Kings North in particular. We have a great natural beauty in Kings North. Not to take anything away from any of the other ridings but one of the great things that we have in Kings North is Cape Split, where you can hear the roar of the moon. If you want to know what the roar of the moon is, that is the sound of the tide rushing around that channel. That whole site is considered to be one of the 50 best hiking trails in the world in some hiking trail books that you will be able to find on the store shelves. It is an absolutely marvellous, gorgeous site and possibly, maybe even in our province, underutilized or undermanaged. On any given day, in fact on Remembrance Day, November 11<sup>th</sup>, there were 27 cars in that parking lot, people hiking to Cape Split on a cold, wet day. During the summer there are many, many more people there. That's part of the community of Scots Bay.</p>
<p>We also have probably the most favourable climate in Nova Scotia, on the Valley floor where I farm, and one of the most favourable soils. Those two things have brought agriculture into our county.</p>
<p>We have in Kings North three fire departments: the Kentville Fire Department, the Canning Fire Department, and the Port Williams Fire Department. Together with Kings South and Kings West, we probably have one of the highest concentrations of fire equipment on a per capita basis of anywhere in the world. I know from my involvement with Kings Mutual Insurance Company that anywhere on the Valley floor you will get insurance based on the fact as if there was a fire hydrant right out beside your door because anywhere on the Valley floor the insurance companies will quote, giving you the best possible coverage for fire protection. That is because of the volunteers in Kings North and the commitment they have to excellence in providing fire trucks and equipment. Certainly Kentville and Canning and Port Williams are no exception; they have exceptional fire departments. I know Kings South and Kings West do too.</p>
<p>We have a lot of great community events in all of the many communities, and a lot of those relate around food. I found out during the pre-election period and during the election time that there were many events that I had never taken part in, as a farmer. As a farmer you tend to stay home and work but I discovered that there were strawberry suppers. If you've never had a strawberry supper, you might wonder, what in the world is a strawberry supper? I would invite you to come next summer to the Billtown Baptist Church strawberry supper or to the Pereaux Baptist Church strawberry supper.</p>
<p>We also have fantastic breakfasts. For instance, in the Black Rock Community Centre breakfasts, unbelievably good breakfasts in some of the rural areas, and St. James Anglican Church breakfasts, which go on, every month there is one. So there's a lot of different events in our many communities in Kings North.</p>
<p>We have many parades, we have of course the well-known Apple Blossom Parade. There are also parades in Canning and Kingsport and Scots Bay. There are many great things that we are doing there as a community.</p>
<p>What are some of the issues for Kings North? Obviously many of the things have already been mentioned here - roads and health care, the out-migration of our young people. People are looking for integrity in government.</p>
<p>I know that as a farmer, I can tell you that the farm community operates mostly on verbal agreements. We will make agreements with our neighbours on land rental, just based on a verbal agreement. There's an ethic there that you keep your word. I don't think that's related to just farmers, I think that's throughout the province. There's an expectation that people will keep their word. In the farm community it's critical because you never know when you need to rely on that neighbour to help you do something, so that relationship is more important than any one deal that you might be able to gain on, so you keep your word with your neighbours. I know that there's an expectation that this Liberal Government will do that, too, in my riding, an expectation of that.</p>
<p>Another issue, we've talked about agriculture, I know there's the Ivany report coming out soon. Ray Ivany, of course, is in Kings South but not very far away and I've met with him. That report hasn't come out yet but it was out in draft form. There's a big emphasis in that report on investing in the rural economy of Nova Scotia in the primary industries that have fuelled the economy of Nova Scotia for 150, 200 years. Having had the opportunity to drive into Halifax as much as I do now, I see this is a different world. You realize that there is maybe a disconnect between the rural areas and the city, and I think that the rural parts of our province don't appreciate the fact that they need the city to do well. I'm not sure that the city understands that the city needs the rural economy to do well. It is a partnership and a relationship. (Applause)</p>
<p>I would say that we need to be sure as a House that we invest in the rural economy of Nova Scotia. The rural economy in many areas has taken it on the chin in the last number of years and we've seen that in out-migration. Even in Kings County, which traditionally had one of the strongest rural economies in the province, we've seen the beginnings of that out-migration where we see people leaving our area.</p>
<p>If I go back to my Dutch heritage, my parents, when they came here they were - it was a program between the Government of Canada and the Government of Holland. They didn't actually have the money to come to Canada and I was always under the belief that the Canadian Government paid their trip but they told me that it was actually the Dutch Government that paid their trip - to get rid of them, I guess - anyway, brought them here. Nevertheless, it was a partnership between the two governments, and I would say that one of my dreams for agriculture is that we renew that type of a program to bring in farmers.</p>
<p>If we look at the Province of Nova Scotia, we know that in the 1920s we peaked in agricultural production in many items. Maybe not in some of the new things being grown - certainly not in grapes - but in many of our products we peaked in the 1920s. The Margaree Valley was farmed and the Musquodoboit Valley was farmed and the Annapolis Valley was farmed all the way down and all down through Yarmouth - all of that was farmed at one time. I believe that we are not short on land, but we are short on farmers. We need to bring people in.</p>
<p>One of the other things that my father came into Canada with - he was without money, but he had an excellent agricultural education. Even though I went to the Agricultural College in Truro and to the University of Guelph and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, when I was all done and went back to the farm, Dad taught me how to farm. I believe that agricultural education system that they have in Holland is something we need to think about doing.</p>
<p>I know that the farmers of Nova Scotia are looking for this government to invest in agriculture; the strawberry growers are looking to see what this government will do, and the apple growers are looking to see what this government is going to do. There are many expectations and many hopes that our industry, the agricultural industry, can be more than it is. The public certainly is interested in local food and seeing all those things grow. In fisheries, too, there's a lot at stake right now for the lobster fishermen and low prices have stressed those industries. We as a House need to see that those industries are able to succeed and grow. I would say that's what we need to be working on as a House.</p>
<p>In terms of the election, I too had a team of people who supported me, some 35 people who were key members of my election campaign team and I would like to say thank you to them. I don't plan to read all 35 names but I will say that my co-campaign chairs Elva Heyge and Heather Tupper were key. We had a number of key people who really committed a lot of time and effort and contributed in many different ways so I would like to say thank you to them, and to Martha McQuarrie as well.</p>
<p>Of course, I would like to say thank you to my wife, Heather, who is not here tonight but who was very supportive in me running. Just to backtrack a little, this was a year of change for me. If you had asked me a year ago would I ever be here standing before you talking, I would have said no, I would not have thought that would happen. The year of change began for me in January when I said yes to going to Kenya and working with Farmers Helping Farmers for three weeks with two women's groups: one of 60 women and one of 100 women farmers. In Kenya, the women are the farmers. (Applause)</p>
<p>We were able to make a difference in small ways. When you go there you wonder what can I do, but I was able to make a difference in those in very small ways to improve the situation of those farmers, and with that I would like to say hats off to Farmers Helping Farmers.</p>
<p>That was January and you may recall, if you know your international news, Kenya was in the midst of an election which was going to take place. The previous election in 2008 had seen 6,000 people killed in election violence so there was some concern about that, but I was able to see, for one thing, what truly bad government can do to a country, but I was also able to see a people full of optimism, who were totally enamoured with the election process. We were able to see billboards - 100 feet high by 50 to 60 feet wide were not an uncommon site. The Kenyans were totally absorbed in politics and totally into it and maybe that rubbed off on me because when I came back it was the start of the nomination process to become elected and all of that, so that trip probably rubbed off on me - well, actually, I know it did.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I would like to say once again, thank you, it's an honour to be here and I look forward to working in the House. I know that we have high hopes for the Liberals, and I look forward to working with the Minister of Agriculture, and Fisheries and Aquaculture. I know that will not be a problem and we'll be able to work together fine, and I look forward to serving the people of Kings North. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting to hear both the Liberals and the NDP debating this important topic, since they've both locked in on either hitching their wagons to one solution or the other, without doing their own homework about what would actually work best to freeze power rates or actually deliver lower power rates to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I do want to give the Liberals credit for calling the debate today; even though they are a little late to the party, I'm glad they're finally here. I will table for the benefit of the House the press release from December 4, 2012, where the PCs actually caused an emergency debate on the cost of Muskrat Falls to happen in the first place. Leave it to the Liberals when they smell political opportunity finally, months later, to do the same thing, but, of course, we've been asking the government to show us the cost of Muskrat Falls, tell us how much that power will cost when it comes to our homes and businesses, for months and months now, but at least they're here.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that we supported this late, but better-late-than-never call for an emergency debate today is that the Premier himself, on behalf of the government has long ago made up his mind about how much Nova Scotians are going to pay and where they're going to get their power from for the next 35 years. That's why he and his government passed the Maritime Link Act and Regulations which forced the URB to do what they want them to do and if anyone had any doubt that that's what is really going on here all they need to do is look at the <i>Cape Breton Post</i> from just a few days ago - and I will table this quote from Premier Dexter, where he says "People, I think, may think that it has to do with the UARB hearing. But that project is going ahead and the only question is how that's going to happen." Now what kind of responsible, political Leader would make their mind up first and then tie the hands of the URB, the one body that we're supposed to rely on to determine what is the lowest and best cost for Nova Scotians?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Order, please. Just a quick little note here. It is not proper to refer to any member by their name in any way during proceedings of the House, this includes notices of motion and while reading from documents such as newspaper stories. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that clarification. Those are the words of the Premier who long ago made up his mind, who before the Maritime Link hearings even start has sanctioned the project allowing Emera to go ahead with their work, incurring costs, accepting that a penalty will be payable by the taxpayers of Nova Scotia if there are any changes to the regulations in the future. It is not right to handcuff the people of Nova Scotia like that over so much money, over such a long period of time.</p>
<p>In the everyday lives of most Nova Scotians, when it comes time to make a major purchase, a home or a car, well, they do their homework, they look at all of the options available, they look at all the costs. This Premier wants Nova Scotians to buy a shiny new car regardless of the cost and instead of doing his own homework, instead of comparing all the options and finding the lowest-priced green power for the future of our province, he has picked one and signed on the dotted line and committed to it. Then, to try to show that it is the lowest cost, instead of doing a fair comparison to all of the other options what he does is he allows for hundreds of consultants, millions of dollars to be spent on consultants to try to show that that one choice works for Nova Scotians. Well, we could save a lot of money on all of those consultants and all of those hearings if we just had a Premier and a government that made these decisions in a businesslike way by asking everyone who can supply us with power, including Muskrat Falls, to come forward with their best bid for clean, green, renewable energy. Then we would know whether this is the right choice or not, but that's not what they are doing.</p>
<p>How ironic that in the last election the Premier and the NDP ran on a promise to stop the increases in power rates - and before anyone says, no, we didn't, in that virtual world that they now live in, we have the brochures and the advertising that was done by the government that made exactly that claim. Now their record four years in is clear: a 30 per cent increase in power rates, and that after they got into office the NDP decided on their own that they want Nova Scotia to not just go renewable - which, of course, is a goal everybody would applaud - but that we had to be the most renewable on the planet as fast as possible, regardless of the cost, regardless of the price, regardless of the jobs that are thrown aside along the way, and that is wrong.</p>
<p>Neither the Liberals nor the NDP want to talk about it, but the truth is the truth. The reasons our power rates are going up - the power company has admitted it, and the Minister of Energy has admitted it on occasion - is that the government is wanting the power company to buy renewable energy far faster than Nova Scotians can afford. That is the problem: a 30 per cent increase, and without any mandate to do it. One can just imagine if the NDP had asked Nova Scotians in the last election, are you willing to pay 30 per cent more so that we alone can claim to be more renewable than anyone else the fastest? What Nova Scotians would have voted if they had been given that question?</p>
<p>That, Mr. Speaker, is the problem. No one gave them the mandate to do that. No one said it's okay to lose 5,000 jobs because we have to have the highest power rates in the country. No one said it's okay that my household budget or my neighbour's budget has to be squeezed, or that seniors have to close off rooms in their apartments that they can't afford to heat because we have a government that wants to boast that they are the most renewable on the planet. No one was asked that question, and that's why we are where we are today, and that is wrong.</p>
<p>If anyone thinks that the Liberals are any better on this question, they are sorely mistaken. It's time the truth came from the Liberal Party as well. It's time the truth came from there as well: as much as they like to complain, carp, tear down, and rip up, do you know what their answer is on energy? They had to photocopy a failed policy from New Brunswick and spend a lot of money on TV ads trying to convince Nova Scotians that it would do any better here. Somehow they have stumbled upon a policy that not only drives up our rates higher - which has been shown time and time again in New Brunswick, in Ontario, in Alberta, in California, in Texas, and in other places - but it actually kills investment in renewables at the same time.</p>
<p>Renewable to retail does not work, because it makes power rates more expensive for everybody and it eliminates any investment in renewables at the same time. It takes a special kind of genius to find a way to both raise our rates and reduce the opportunity for renewable investment at the same time, but that is what the Liberal Party has come to - even though right next door, their own review, which anyone who takes five minutes to do their homework can find out, has been found to be an absolute failure of a policy.</p>
<p>Now, after criticizing the NDP for wanting to hitch our wagon for a long, long time to one source, to Muskrat Falls, they are actually making secret phone calls into <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b> trying to hitch our wagon there. Mr. Speaker, they are exactly as guilty as the NDP are of going about trying to find political solutions to what is a very human and real economic problem in our province.</p>
<p>Even though they spent a lot of money from who knows where on TV ads, when their Leader was asked will your policy actually reduce power rates, do you know what he said, Mr. Speaker, on the CBC? What he said was, well actually no, we just want stable power rates.</p>
<p>Now how ironic is that, that is exactly the same sorry excuse that we hear from the NDP. The definition of stable for Liberals is the same as it is for the NDP, it means up and up and up. Stable means up. That is the exposed truth and it's time that Nova Scotians knew the truth about the crazy policies that both the Liberals and the NDP are promoting on power.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if we're ever going to kick-start the economy of Nova Scotia, save those jobs, if we're ever going to create new jobs in all parts of our province, we need to put in place the fundamentals of a modern, dynamic economy. That means lower taxes that are fair and competitive. That means power rates that are fair and competitive. That means investments in our schools that allow every child to get ahead in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</p>
<p>When it comes to power, we can't afford more 30 per cent increases like the NDP have, we can't afford failed schemes like the Liberals use for their own political purposes that actually don't do a thing that's positive for our economy or for Nova Scotians. What we can do is freeze the increases in power rates in their tracks right now, stop the madness by instructing the power company that they should buy as much renewable energy every year as they can, within the current rates. We can get to the same result - that green, renewable day we all want - we get to the same result within the current rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, anyone who understands how the economy works, anyone who has done their homework trying to get to the right answer, will know that every year the power company pays off a little bit more of those old plants, freeing up money within the current rates for investment in renewable. We will get to that same end result but not another job may be lost in this province, not another family having to make that awful choice, when they can't make their power bill, about what they're going to give up instead. We all get there together, to that renewable, affordable day that is so important to a modern, dynamic economy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we can actually lower power rates. This has been shown by independent studies that instead of hitching our wagon to some expensive plan from Muskrat Falls or making secret phone calls to hitch our wagon into Quebec, if we actually made a businesslike choice and that is to review all of these projects, Mr. Speaker, free up the URB to make the best choice they can - because the sorry truth is, why did the government pass the Maritime Link Act in the first place, when we have a URB that when left to its own devices, would be free to do exactly what needs to be done, which is look at all of the options, no matter where they may be.</p>
<p>What Nova Scotians want to know is that somewhere someone has done their homework to find the lowest-price power for them, not hitch our wagon to one place, not hitch our wagon to another place. Where can we get the cheapest possible power that is also renewable in the future?</p>
<p>You know what, Mr. Speaker? We have spent 20 years under all Parties, watching one of those options whiz by our province into New England and that is natural gas, which may not meet the NDP renewable dream but it is two-thirds cleaner when it comes to emissions and it is a lot cheaper. The Utility and Review Board is not even looking at natural gas on its own, they have to join it up with wind. Why not look at it on its own? Why not reclaim that gas to generate electricity here?</p>
<p>I heard the member opposite talk about Manitoba using hydro. Well, they should check their own research because in Manitoba today do you know what they're investing in? Not more hydro, which they could, because it's too expensive, more natural gas because it is clean and cheap. So let's take our natural gas and burn more of it here and save Nova Scotia households a lot of money and build that economy that creates jobs for all the people of the province, no matter where they live, and is two-thirds greener.</p>
<p>If the government hadn't passed the Maritime Link Act, the URB would be free to pursue that option among all others. But the fact they felt the need to bring into this House a Maritime Link Act and regulations to restrict the URB is proof that neither the NDP nor the Liberals have a clue about how to actually get power prices under control, and that's why this is an emergency debate. Because of three Parties, we have two who are in a state of their own emergency, because they don't know what to do other than play politics with something as important as the price of electricity, and that's what's wrong here today.</p></speech>

On behalf of the constituents of Digby, I would also like to extend my sincere congratulations to the Premier on forming a new government. I would also like to make the note that the visit the Premier made to the riding during the campaign was fully appreciated and we have an open invitation any time he wants to visit our riding in the future.</p>
<p>The Liberal platform that was outlined during the campaign was well thought out, thorough, and more achievable than we would have ever expected. I would like to say that this guide will ensure all Nova Scotians are given an opportunity to move forward, and for that, I thank the Premier.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise to speak in this emergency debate, and I certainly want to commend my colleague, the member for Dartmouth East, and the Leader of our Party, who have continually put the issue of electricity on the front burner here in Nova Scotia, after listening to what Nova Scotians are going through, in order to try to find solutions.</p>
<p>I have to say the focus of my remarks was not going to be on the Third Party, but after what I just heard I have to say I can't understand why they're in Opposition, because after what we just heard from the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, they have all the answers - they're right and everyone else is wrong. How is it possible that they're sitting in third place in this Legislature? Maybe if the Leader of the Third Party had somehow been involved with the previous Progressive Conservative Government, maybe they wouldn't be in Opposition.</p>
<p>But wait a minute - wasn't he the chief of staff, the top political position in the Progressive Conservative Government? Then how can it be, if he had all the answers to energy and to electricity, why is it that under a Progressive Conservative Government for 10 years we saw increases every year? Where were all of his answers during those 10 years? Whether he was chief of staff of the Credit Union, he still had the ideas. Why was he hiding them? Why wasn't he making secret calls at night to the Premier? Either the one he was chief of staff with, or the Premier after that? Yet suddenly today, he's got all the answers, and would lecture us. But with all due respect, Mr. Speaker, neither I, nor any of our caucus, nor any Nova Scotians, need a lecture from the Leader of the Third Party in this Legislature.</p>
<p>It's quite clear that energy is one of the main focuses that's on the minds of Nova Scotians, whether they be in Richmond County, whether they be anywhere in the province. Mr. Speaker, I had a lady who contacted my office about three weeks ago and she said, my power bill, from one month to the next, one billing period to the next because they're monthly billing periods, it increased by $400. But she said, I didn't do anything differently. How is that? I said, well, there was a 3 per cent increase that the government of the day allowed to take place again. But even she said, I'm not that good at math but 3 per cent doesn't add up to a $400 increase.</p>
<p>And it's true, so I asked myself, is it possibly just a fluke? It might be a billing error or something; maybe this is not something that's the norm, so I posted a message on my Facebook site, which is the new way of communicating with our constituents, and I gave her story, and said, has anyone else experienced something similar? And, Mr. Speaker, the answer that came back - which is on my Facebook site for those who are friends on the site, I believe there's over 1,400 people - but people were sharing their stories of $100 increases, $200, $300, and one was over a $500 increase. And yet people were saying we've done everything possible to reduce our consumption. We've changed our appliances; we have changed our light bulbs; we're doing everything possible to consume less, but our power rates keep going up.</p>
<p>To their credit, Nova Scotia Power has agreed to look at all of their account information and do a review to see if there is some other explanation. But it's clear that this is happening in households throughout Nova Scotia, so we can sit here and we can blame each other, or we can try to find solutions. Is the Maritime Link a possible solution? Maybe. Is it the best possible deal for Nova Scotians? We don't know the answer to that. The Premier will tell us it is; the Minister of Energy tells us it is, yet the one independent body that has asked to look at this from a non-political perspective, looking at the finances, looking at the projections, looking at the terms of the deal, is being restricted in the length of time that he can reach a decision. That's the concern that we have.</p>
<p>I want to say that I'm proud of the fact that our Leader went, a number of years ago, to Newfoundland and Labrador, and started the discussion about how Nova Scotia might be able to benefit from that. We've never said that we're against it, what we've said is, is it the best possible deal? Have we entered into a deal that's in the best interests of Nova Scotians? That is the essence of the argument and I don't believe Nova Scotians are convinced of that, and I think they are looking for an independent body to be able to tell them whether they agree it is the best deal.</p>
<p>If we were the only ones in this province saying that we have questions about the Maritime Link, then one could easily say it's politics. But the Minister of Energy knows we're not alone. Interveners are asking the same thing, a group has formed of professionals that took time out of their busy lives to say, we're very concerned about entering into this deal, we have many questions. We should be listening to them. It's ironic in all this debate that we hear about what a terrible deal Newfoundland and Labrador entered into with Quebec years ago. Yet here we are rushing to enter into another 35-year deal.</p>
<p>If anything, history should tell us we should take our time, we should make sure it is the best possible deal. I would suggest that if we weren't on the verge of an election, the government would not be in a rush. But that is what it is pushing this. And for a 35-year deal, we should take our time.</p>
<p>I have to say, it was interesting today the contrast of messages we heard from the government. We heard the Deputy Premier when he was being asked about the issues with the Auditor General's funding and the error with the $27 million in the budget, his response was, we're looking forward, the Opposition can keep looking behind at what happened last year and a few weeks ago, we're looking forward. Then the Minister of Community Services gets up and she starts talking about the governments for the last 250 years in Nova Scotia and what they did. I'm not sure if you would call that looking forward, but if that's the case I don't want to meet her on the highway because I think she spends a lot more time looking in her rear-view mirror than she does looking out her windshield. (Applause)</p>
<p>But imagine, here we are in 2013 having a majority government talking about 250 years ago. That's what we had. But it gets better, because as ridiculous as it was for the Minister of Community Services, we have the Premier of the province get up and talk about the single largest power increase this province has seen under a Liberal Government. Naturally, I was quite surprised to hear that, so our question was, what year was it? The Premier, he's cagey, he didn't answer, he's politically smart. The member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville (Interruption) anyway, as I said, the Premier is very politically smart, but the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville, with great joy, shouts out 1977.</p>
<p>We know that the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville wasn't born then, so we can't blame him for that. I'll acknowledge that. I guess I have to apologize, I was five years old and I'm a Liberal so I guess I have to say I'm sorry for what happened in 1977. How ridiculous can you get when a majority government sits there and refers to 1977 when we have Nova Scotians that are trying to decide, do I renew my prescriptions, do I go buy food or do I keep Nova Scotia Power from cutting off my electricity at my house? And they want to talk about what happened in 1977.</p>
<p>The mix of messages today was again amazing because every other day you will hear the government say what a horrible thing it was when the Tories privatized Nova Scotia Power. It was terrible. Yet today, Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, under the NDP is the fourth largest electricity monopoly in the world. But who owns Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec? It's the people of Quebec, but somehow this government has decided that Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec is evil.</p>
<p>I have my own suspicions as what the undertones of those are and they're not pretty, they're ugly, they're absolutely ugly. I can say to hear a Premier who was the chair of the Council of the Federation openly attack another province - whether they like it or not, Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec is the people of Quebec. I don't know what they've done to this government, certainly federally they supported them, but they've done something. To now hear the Minister of Energy say we want a made-in-Atlantic-Canada solution. Well, Quebec is next door, not on the other side of the world. Do you know what Nova Scotians want? They want the best possible solution. They don't care where it comes from. They want to see lower power rates so that they can afford to heat their homes and they can afford to have energy security for their families.</p>
<p>I'm proud to be part of a Party that is prepared to look everywhere, prepared to explore every option, and prepared to do everything it takes to find lower electricity for Nova Scotians and a better future for Nova Scotians, and is not prepared to close any doors in seeking that solution.

I will repeat that this guide will ensure all Nova Scotians are given an opportunity to move forward and for that I thank you, Mr. Premier, and all of those who worked very hard to develop our platform. I would also like to congratulate all the new members, those who have been elected to serve in the House of Assembly; to the returning members, you will be a source of inspiration and guidance to me. You have shown the ability to maintain the confidence of the voters and congratulations to all of you.</p>
<p>As I begin my remarks today I would like to take a few moments to talk about the elimination of the former Clare constituency. As we all know, the first report on the Electoral Boundaries Commission recommended the protection of the Acadian ridings. Unfortunately, the government of the day decided to eliminate the riding of Clare because the population of this area was too small. It is true that the former riding of Clare was smaller than most constituencies in this province. Notwithstanding its size, Clare was protected by the two previous Electoral Boundaries Commissions, in 1992 and 2002.</p>
<p>The protected status of these Acadian ridings reflected the principle of effective representation, as recognized by the courts, and respected the official minority-language status of the Acadian community. The elimination of the Clare constituency is a problem for the Nova Scotia Acadian community. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that on June 14, 2012, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia declared that the interim report of the 2012 Electoral Boundaries Commission was null and void. The Acadians questioned whether the Attorney General at that time overstepped his authority by intervening in the engaging process of the boundary review. The report was supposed to be submitted to the public for feedback, not subject to the arbitrary judgment of the Attorney General. (Applause)</p>
<p>The people of the Town of Digby and the Municipality of the District of Digby were never consulted. Even during my campaign, people of the riding were not aware of the review or the changes to the riding, and did not understand that their riding was now gone and part of a large combined riding.</p>
<p>Direct requests were made to the commissioner by the former MLA for Digby-Annapolis to come to our communities to hear the people. These requests were ignored. The people of Digby and the Municipality of Digby were faced with a fait accompli. The decision to eliminate the Clare constituency is now before the courts. Suffice to say that the elimination of the Clare riding did not reflect the will of the residents of Clare or the residents of Annapolis, Digby, and the Nova Scotia Acadian community.</p>
<p>This specific opening remark makes reference to the very existence of the Clare-Digby constituency I was elected to represent. This is an historic moment. Not at all impressed by the circumstances surrounding the elimination of the riding of Clare, I am honoured to have been chosen to represent the new Clare-Digby constituency.</p>
<p>After an election an elected person has to express his or her gratitude to those who helped them get elected. In a democracy no one can pretend to be able to be a one-man show. An elected official is part of a team. My debts begin with Junior Theriault and Wayne Gaudet, who were the previous MLAs for Clare and Digby. They acted as co-campaign managers for myself. They are team leaders. They took charge of a well-organized campaign.</p>
<p>I guess I must speak at this time also to the fact that in their opening remarks that were made by Junior, the 15,000 forgotten people have now grown to the 20,000. I am not going to say they are the 20,000 forgotten people, because the legacy of Wayne and Junior is one that I'll say that they are remembered now, and their legacy is going to go on with me.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this time to thank my wife, Deidre, for her continued support, and all the campaign workers who helped me. They helped me become better known in all the areas of Digby County. My thanks also to those who contributed to the financial campaign. There's a cost associated with campaigning. A sincere thanks to you, the constituents who contributed to the campaign in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The rules are strict around election expenses and fundraising. I am very grateful to Pat Potts, my official agent, for her close control of expenses and record-keeping. The selection of an official agent is only second to selecting a campaign manager. This person must be trustworthy, organized, have an excellent financial background, and be committed to working long hours after the election is over. I was extremely lucky to find such a person in Ms. Potts. I have literally known her all of my life. She was a previous office manager for two local businesses, currently retired, past town councillor and a hard-working, capable person at the young age of 81. She kept us straight during the election, and I thoroughly enjoyed working with her in this campaign. My gratitude goes to a fine lady, my mother, who took the role of an official agent - thanks to you, mom.</p>
<p>Most of my gratitude goes to the citizens of Digby County who made me feel most welcomed at the doors and at the community gatherings during the campaign, and more importantly trusted me with the mandate to represent them in this assembly. To you, Madam Speaker, I stand in this chamber to bring greetings from the residents of Clare-Digby, the residents of Digby County. We are blessed with a special diverse riding and I would like to take a few minutes to take all of you around our area.</p>
<p>We have a population of approximately 20,000 and around 14,700 voters. Our area goes from Westport, to Digby, to Bear River, to Richfield, to Beaver River. A two and a half hour drive takes you from one end to the other. Now when I say diverse, I mean diverse. I don't think I could think of another riding that can stand next to ours in that diversity. I'll start you with the Digby Gut and the sunset in the Gut, it's something you will not find anywhere else in the world. The mixing of the highest tides, linger fog, and the constant traffic of fishing boats makes this a very special place.</p>
<p>We're lucky to have the specular Bay of Fundy and all its natural resources touching the shoreline of our riding. Being on the southwest corner of Nova Scotia provides endless sunsets with the waters of St. Mary's Bay, the Bay of Fundy, throughout the entire year. It is sometimes interesting to reflect on the Digby Gut as the entry way for Samuel de Champlain and Sieur de Mons in 1605 and what their eyes might have seen.</p>
<p>Overlooking the Annapolis Basin and the Town of Digby sits one of the most specular resorts in Nova Scotia, the Digby Pines. This beautiful facility is unique and is complemented by a world class, Stanley Thompson-designed golf course. The Digby area is closely tied to the economic impact of this resort and recognizes its importance in rural Nova Scotia. I must mention that the golf course has shown some challenges with water drainage and I will continue to lobby for the need to improve this important facility.</p>
<p>Without detail explanation we all know how the link between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is crucial for southwest Nova Scotia. We are very fortunate to have this ferry arriving in our community every day. The past pressures on maintaining these marine transportation links have emphasised, and more importantly identified, their overall roles. We must continue to grow new opportunities and make new partnerships with our neighbours in Saint John, throughout New Brunswick, and the New England states.</p>
<p>Digby scallops have been the longest standing brand representing fishing industry in Digby County. We have the best scallops in the world and continue to see this resource remain such a crucial part of our economy. Our area sees the cold tidal waters of the Bay of Fundy as a perfect place to grow scallops. Celebrating scallops is part of Scallops Days, a tradition we are proud of. I invite all the members of this assembly to come to this great festival in August.</p>
<p>Clare-Digby has many fishing communities. We must never forget the brave fishermen who have lost their lives in this industry, not only in Digby County but also in many other Nova Scotian coastal communities who have lost men and women working on the sea. In Clare-Digby we have beautiful Long Island and Brier Island. These islands are a unique place not to be found anywhere else in Nova Scotia. The villages of Tiverton, Freeport, and Westport are timeless examples of fishing communities and rural coastal communities.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, traveling over two ferries to reach Brier Island is an adventure into natural beauty and one of the most diverse bird and marine wildlife areas in the world. Whale watching is at its best there and I can personally attest to the quality experience and the professional captains who pilot the watchers, again, one of these captains, being the previous member for Digby-Annapolis, Junior Theriault.</p>
<p>Another attraction in the area of the islands is the Balancing Rock. It is one of the many destination points people from around the world come to visit. We must continue to focus on the economic pressures of our coastal communities as they face population decline, while continuing to protect their natural beauty.</p>
<p>The tidal village of Bear River is another beautiful destination rich in artisans, a wonderful First Nations community and a growing wine industry. Interestingly enough, Bear River is seen as the first place grapes from Europe were grown in North America as a gift to the local First Nations.</p>
<p>Back to the Digby area, I would be remiss not to mention the Wharf Rat Rally. Here motorcycle enthusiasts gather year after year from far and wide. This hugely successful event has become the largest mass gathering in Nova Scotia outside of Halifax; it is also the largest Canadian rally of its kind east of Ontario. Events such as these represent the necessary economic diversity rural Nova Scotia must need to sustain themselves. My sincere congratulations go out to the huge number of organizers and volunteers that make this event successful.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, there is another important social fabric of our constituency. I am extremely proud and honoured to represent La Baie Sainte-Marie within the Clare-Digby riding. La Baie Sainte-Marie is representative of a large Nova Scotian Acadian community stretching from New Edinburgh to Beaver River. This area is the Clare Municipality, the only municipality that conducts its businesses and services in French. It is rich in bilingual Acadian culture that can be found everywhere you go. The music, the cuisine, the kitchen parties, the artistry, is rich in Acadian flare that will surround you and emerge you. The communities of Church Point, Meteghan, Saulnierville, Concession, St. Bernard, are but a few of the many vibrant places where the flavour of Acadian life abounds.</p>
<p>You have to experience le Concert de Noel avec la Chorale du Sud-Ouest, la Fanfare r&#xE9;gionale de Clare et Les voix dans L'Vent on a snowy afternoon to more fully appreciate the Acadian culture and to be submerged into the Christmas spirit.</p>
<p>Another feature in Clare is Mavillette Beach, found near the southwest end of the riding and one of the most beautiful beaches in Nova Scotia. The Clare-Digby area is extremely fortunate to have Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne as an institutional educational gem. This French-language university dates back to 1890 and provides the best opportunity one can find to broaden one's French language skills and education all in one. I inform you that Digby County is a diverse cultural and bilingual community.</p>
<p>I had the fortune to experience the French Immersion Program at Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne first-hand. I am looking forward to learning more of the speaking skills of the beautiful French language.</p>
<p>La Langue Fran&#xE7;aise est une belle langue qu'il nous faut garder et d&#xE9;velopper dans notre r&#xE9;gion.</p>
<p>The French language is beautiful and it is necessary for us to keep developing it in our area.</p>
<p>The cultural and ethnic diversity of our region is a great asset. We must do much more to keep and promote this asset.</p>
<p>Le patrimoine acadien et la culture acadienne forment une richesse pour notre r&#xE9;gion et pour l'ensemble de la province de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.</p>
<p>French immersion was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had within a learning institution. Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne also has shown great leadership in its development of renewable energy opportunities from wind to biomass. This unique educational facility must continue to grow and be supported within the Clare-Digby riding.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, how could one go throughout the Clare-Digby riding without also noting one of the major economic drivers in the mink industry? It is important to note that this industry employs approximately 1,000 people in the Clare-Digby riding and the industry generates one of the single largest agricultural revenues in Nova Scotia. The by-products of the mink industry now bring development in bio oil and pellets used for bio heat and fertilizers.</p>
<p>We are very blessed with a wealth of renewable resources in our riding. From one of the best wind regimes along the North Mountain to the endless Bay of Fundy tides, we are blessed. We have a unique opportunity, because of these wide, diverse renewable resources, to showcase and develop renewable resources. It is important for the future sustainability of our rural communities to see the benefits of these resources invested locally. I believe that developing the renewable resources in our riding is the future, and I will work hard to promote this. Let us not forget that we were in the forefront when Le Nouvelle France, or Electric City, was built in 1895.</p>
<p>I am also delighted to bring you greetings - and, Madam [Deputy] Speaker, this was meant for the previous Speaker who just left - personally from one of your fellow co-workers and a good friend, Claredon Robicheau, who is known in the new Clare-Digby constituency as the founder of Le Transport de Clare. This service provides transportation to the elderly and to the people with disabilities. I'm proud to recognize Claredon Robicheau and his team in the Clare area as the birthplace of community-based transportation in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In 1997, 17 years ago, a volunteer group started what is now a national model in Clare. In 2012 it expanded into all of Digby County. What started in Clare has now expanded into 14 other similar programs in Nova Scotia. In 2011, these community-based transportation groups logged 1.4 million kilometres. They took $520,000 of provincial investment through grants, and by partnerships with municipalities, local businesses, health care groups, fundraising, and fairs they grew that provincial investment into $2.3 million - no small feat these days for a volunteer group.</p>
<p>Through you, Madam Speaker, may I take this opportunity to share with you and some of the other members of this Assembly some of the concerns I have gathered during the campaign. I visited 80 communities, four villages, one town, and one First Nation; hosted 13 community meetings; and participated in two forums. All of my observations that I will present to you came from either private conversations or public gatherings during that campaign.</p>
<p>Although I've painted a pretty picture of a riding to this point, it is necessary to mention some of our challenges, all of which I hope to address in my role in this Legislature. Out-migration is a major threat to all of us, and particularly to rural Nova Scotia. The riding of Clare-Digby has experienced a loss of 1 per cent of its finest citizens per year, every year for the last 10 years. We've lost a small town in 10 years. If this continues, serious consideration must be given to the impact this will place on providing essential services.</p>
<p>I must reflect right now also - it's kind of intriguing - this weekend I was doing interviews for my previous job as Deputy CAO, and we had six people we were interviewing. One question was, what do you see as the major threat to the Municipality of Digby? Every single one of those applicants answered, out-migration. Every single one of them answered that question, and not only did they answer it, they answered it very quickly. They didn't have to think twice about it. What was more interesting was what they mentioned they thought might be something that was going to help us.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't realize, the Digby area has been very blessed, I would say in the last 10 years - in spite of the economic downturn - to turn itself into what I would call an area of optimism, an area of hope, an area that has seen a lot of things taken away from it, and an area that a lot of people are looking at and saying, how come you guys are still so happy there? Why is there still such an air of optimism? Why do you people still have so much stuff going on?</p>
<p>The reason is we have a lot of people there who believe in what we have. We're very blessed. If there is any one thing that I can bring before this floor today - and you don't find it in very many economic development agency documents, studies or consultants' reports - it is the fact that if there's any one thing that we can bring to our communities it is that air of optimism. We need to show that we have hope. We need to show that we believe in our communities and we need to be the ones who do that. It is the same as going to the doctor and getting a bad report, the first thing they tell you is that you've got to keep a positive attitude; the same thing as getting your hockey team up for that game, even though you know you're going to get your butts kicked, you have to have a positive attitude. The same thing goes in communities.</p>
<p>The Highway No. 101 from Digby to Weymouth is a rural road with all the hills, driveways and turns you would see when going for a drive in the country, yet we are faced with calling this Highway No. 101 a 100-Series Highway - Geoff has heard it already - when in essence it is nowhere close to a controlled access highway. Along this stretch of highway children wait for buses, residents place their garbage and people are forced to back out of their driveways. The residents of this area have been lobbying for over 15 years to have this death trap fixed. This missing link needs to see the work start and shine a light into this dark tunnel. I'm very proud and I'm very pleased to hear it mentioned in the Speech from the Throne and I thank the Premier for that.</p>
<p>The Digby area of this riding currently has two doctors for a population of approximately 13,000 people. Chronic shortages of family doctors caused a number of serious problems within the population. I am proud to see positive doctor recruitment plans within the election platform to address this issue and again I thank you, Mr. Premier.</p>
<p>I must also note that we have a good success example in the Clare area where there are currently six doctors serving the community of approximately 7,000 people. This was a result of several initiatives, including a Collaborative Emergency Centre being built by the community, a good doctor recruitment program, access to three seats in medical schools in Sherbrooke, Quebec, for local students who chose to study medicine in French and a locally-funded return of service offer.</p>
<p>Poverty has not escaped us and it is concerning that 30 per cent of our people in the Clare-Digby riding live at or below the poverty line. With poverty we also have our problems with drug dependency and alcoholism. This is not acceptable and we must keep our eyes on representing those who need us the most.</p>
<p>I have experienced the slow decline of another icon of our area, the clam industry. Digby clams are still seen throughout Atlantic Canada on menus in restaurants, yet this industry is in serious decline. Work is being completed to address waste-water outfalls within the Annapolis Basin and we need to work harder to see this industry return to its once flourishing past.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it concerns me also when I see people employed in this industry discriminated upon by forcing them to renew their federal clam licences through the Internet. Not only do we face shortages in Internet access in rural Nova Scotia, it is something that not all people are comfortable with and should be allowed conventional options for renewing their licences.</p>
<p>Our forestry sector has seen better times. This is an area I have been directly involved in as a forest technician during my career with Natural Resources. We are facing major problems with wood supply and finding places for our secondary wood products to be sold within western Nova Scotia. I believe more emphasis needs to be placed on small woodlot owners and good forestry practices for the future of our industry. Digby County is one of the best places to grow trees and it was once a primary location in the world to get red spruce for sailing-ship masts.</p>
<p>Some people want to know why gas prices are consistently higher in Clare-Digby than they are in the metro area. I know there is some complicated formula that takes into consideration distances from refineries as part of the cost calculation but why can't we all share in the expense of developing this great province? Level the playing field and stop putting burdens where burdens should not be. Just consider the extra cost for a local trucking company in Clare-Digby over one year or a fisherman who fuels his boat to get those delicious scallops for all of you.</p>
<p>Certainly we have suffered from the loss of the Yarmouth ferry. Immediately the tour buses disappeared, all of the accommodation people up and down the riding faced serious losses. The impact was far and wide and I was even told that one non-profit group had lost 30 per cent of their donations at a local lighthouse; those kinds of things don't show up in the studies. We all hope that with time this will be restored, knowing this type of loss does not recover overnight.</p>
<p>The nursing home, Villa Acadienne, was mentioned by many people in the riding as needing replacement and I am excited, Madam Speaker, to see plans being worked on to see this replaced during our mandate. (Interruptions) Yes, and so did the Tories before that.</p>
<p>I must share that during the election campaign I did receive an interesting request to meet some Universit&#xE9; Sainte-Anne students. It was late at night, after a day of door-to-door campaigning and a community meeting. The only time I was available was around ten o'clock in the evening. This was part of a class assignment they had on a provincial election. They started by saying they had a project, I replied, so do I. Their questions were quite grilling: the Electoral Boundaries Commission, the boundary issue, the French language, how was I to represent the Acadian culture?</p>
<p>Out of the blue, one of them asked me who my role model was. A fair question but one I wasn't expecting. I hadn't prepared a response or experienced this question ever before. My answer was quickly, Bill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots. Immediately, two of the students smiled - both were good Patriot fans - and the questions got easier from there.</p>
<p>I also would be remiss if I didn't mention my previous history with municipal government. I'm very proud to state that within the riding of Clare-Digby, we have the Municipality of Digby, the Municipality of Clare and the Town of Digby. I can see them in my experience as three of the most accommodating municipal units that I have ever seen that worked together. We have more shared service agreements, we have more sit-downs together and we have virtually no problems in working with each other. We share recreation, transportation, waste water, services for dispatching fire departments. I will say that if you want to look for a model for reforming municipal government, come to Clare-Digby.</p>
<p>The most important thing that I realized more than ever during the campaign was life's complexities. We're not equally fortunate with life's blessings. Some have more than others in our society - those who have more have a larger responsibility. Our collective gaze has been trained to not notice those who struggle around us. We must change this. We cannot allow ourselves to be blinded to those around us and to the environment that sustains us. We must, on a continuous basis, strive to live in harmony with those around us and in harmony with nature.</p>
<p>Going door-to-door, from community to community, meeting individuals with their concerns makes it more evident that no two individuals are the same. With different backgrounds and aspirations there is a uniqueness within each person. Therefore, there is no "one size fits all" solution to the many needs facing the citizens of Digby County. There are differences, we have to recognize these differences.</p>
<p>At times during the campaign I had the impression that government was perceived like some extraterrestrial power capable of solving all the problems. I believe it is our duty as politicians and as elected representatives to remind citizens that government exists to serve. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I believe it is important that we spare no effort to remind everyone that government is an institution that is shaped by us all - elected and non-elected, to serve. However, there are limits to government intervention. It is important to note that all citizens are part of government. Everyone has a role to play in shaping government - not the least, to cast a vote on election day. Not all citizens take this right seriously. There must be a way to educate people and help them see the importance of their involvement.</p>
<p>There is more to a democratic government than Cabinet, caucus, Opposition, departments, and agencies. For a good government we need a consistent interaction between all stakeholders - human interaction and fellowship at all levels. We might not have a perfect government system. What we have in place now allows for input from all to keep government in close check and provide guidelines for private citizens. We must also not forget that human activity can't be regulated without judgment by humans. This is why government decisions are not always perfect.</p>
<p>To the people of Digby County I owe the privilege to sit at this Assembly, and I express to them my gratitude. Madam Speaker, to you and all the Assembly, I invite you to visit the people of Clare-Digby sometime soon. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ce90163b-7a3b-4884-b7d9-b5ca06af4cc3"><from>MR. GARY BURRILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on this side have presented a range of important points in relation to this resolution. I don't want to repeat what they have already said, but I do wish for a few moments to focus on an element of the overall Muskrat Falls debate that sometimes is, though it ought not to be, cast into the shade in the midst of various discussions about things like project costs and electricity prices. That subject is the extraordinarily important contribution of the Muskrat Falls project to the most significant environmental challenge of our era: the mitigation of climate change and the efforts to bring into curtailment our province's aggregate greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>I'm one of those people in Nova Scotia who holds the view that when this era is subject to the judgment of history and when governments of the early 21<sup>st</sup> Century are subject also to that judgment, one key criterion on which that assessment is going to be made will be what was done or what was not done on the era's pivotal question of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, as elsewhere, on the matter of climate change we are in the position of three individuals who are described in the Old Testament - three lepers, in fact - who found themselves in a situation - it's a long story, but I'll cut to the chase - where they were at the gate of a certain city, a place where they were not permitted to be, and where they were also unable for a number of reasons to retreat into the city that they had just come from. They therefore found themselves in a position where they had no choice but to make a move. They had to make a move, as we have to make a move on greenhouse gases. So those individuals set out with some boldness into the future.</p>
<p>As we do this stepping out on this question under our government's leadership, we do so on the basis of a program which has a variety of important facets. We do so on the basis of the overarching goal of 40 per cent energy production from renewables by 2020. We do so on the basis of the range of government programs for bringing renewables onto the grid. We do so on the basis of salient industrial investments, and particularly I would draw attention to the investment in LED lighting in Amherst and the production of turbines in Trenton. We do so on the basis of the transformation from the sinecure-ridden Conserve Nova Scotia to Efficiency Nova Scotia, with the six-fold increase in expenditures on energy savings that has accompanied this transition. We do so on the basis of the development and the investment in tidal power, and we do so on the very important basis and foundation of Muskrat Falls and the Maritime Link.</p>
<p>Unlike some others who have contributed to this debate, I am not an expert in the energy field. I have, however, spent much of my life in the area of project development, in the area of what people sometimes call social entrepreneurship - that is, in the development and bringing to fruition and realization of co-operative or other sorts of community initiatives and projects. In the work of bringing forward projects in communities over my life one thing I have learned is that the development of projects that have a major scope, projects which are bold, as the lepers were in stepping forward, projects which have kind of a breathtaking kind of characteristic about them, in the development of those kinds of projects, there is a very familiar pattern.</p>
<p>A project - let's say perhaps for a new co-operative - will go through the requisite period such projects have to have of research and detailed thought and consideration. That period will go along until the moment comes when it ought to come when a decision is made, as with the decision being made by the lepers in the Old Testament, it goes along until the decision is made that now is the moment to step boldly beyond the gate, now is the moment to step boldly beyond the city, now is the moment to step ahead and go to the place where we have to go.</p>
<p>When a project in a community is being developed and it comes to the point where that project is actually being concretely put forward, often there's a familiar pattern of difficulties that can take place. For every great project has a certain point, it has a certain moment when the adequate information is on hand for going forward but where every last little "i" cannot yet utterly be dotted and every last "t" cannot yet utterly be crossed because that's the point in the project when those questions simply cannot be answered with absolute exactitude and precision at that time.</p>
<p>Very often at this very predictable stage of the development of any kind of a major, bold, breathtaking project, there's something difficult that happens. Often at that stage of the project those who have not adequately taken in the scope of the project, those who have not taken in the scope of the project's vision, those who are heavy-footed by their nature, those who are actually, in fact, committed to staying in the gates or who are committed to returning to the city, they will invariably, they can be counted on repeatedly to ask for more study, for more research, for more information, for more time, in fact for more anything at all. It's like moving forward with the job of the moment, the establishing of the project.</p>
<p>Very often community organizers will tell you, very often they'll do so by focusing on the absence of that very type of detailed exactitude which precisely cannot be produced at such a moment in the development of any breathtaking, major project.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I regard the continued questioning from the Opposition about the precise effect, dollars and cents, of Muskrat Falls on the power bills to come into people's homes in future years - I regard this continued pattern of questioning, along with the repeated calls for delays and reviews and evaluations of the Maritime Link, I regard these as considerations of this very predictable order in the development of any major project.</p>
<p>I propose that Nova Scotia at this moment does not need this kind of hesitant, heavy-footedness, not when it comes to climate change. In every project that is ultimately worthwhile and necessary, there does come a moment when those who cannot move beyond this nigglieness of negation have to be left behind. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to rise and join this debate here this evening. The point of this debate is that we're looking to see that the Utility and Review Board should have a little bit more time to step back and look at the facts and the circumstances around the power rates and the Muskrat Falls and the Maritime Link project, to see if it's a good project for the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we just heard about the lepers, the gates, and not being able to step back and you have to go forward. We're in a different situation here today. We're able to step back, take a deep breath and try to determine if this project is the best for the Province of Nova Scotia. We heard a speaker talk this afternoon, earlier in the debate, about putting all our eggs in one basket, how every other Party is putting their eggs in one basket. Now I know the Easter season has just passed and he probably enjoyed his Easter with his Easter egg hunts but, we're debating a serious issue here, a real serious issue. We're hearing about stable power rates and they are saying at the lowest possible cost, but they can't tell us what the lowest possible cost is. I mean, we're all for stable power rates, but the cost - Nova Scotians can't afford the rate we're going at today.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia Power has said that it's going to cost 2 and 3 per cent a year in our power rates for the rest of the decade, and we hear this afternoon from the government that it's going to cost a half of a percentage point. Mr. Speaker, they talk about the travel around the province, the power tour they were on. I listened and sat in on one of these tours, and I agree that Muskrat Falls may be green, but I'm telling you the way they are speaking, that everybody is jumping up and down and they are partying in the streets about Muskrat Falls and the cost of power rates, that's not what I heard. They asked the same questions that we asked - what is the cost and what will the cost be on our power rates?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>We got no answer, but we also got time turned off. We were supposed to have a presentation for two hours, and an hour and half in that was enough, we had to go talk to the media. That was game over; we had no chance to ask the rest of the questions. So is it a good deal? We don't know. If it is a good deal, we're all behind it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if the information is accurate and it is a good deal for the people of Nova Scotia, then that's great. but to lock us into a contract for 35 years with no way out - if that's not a good deal the rest of us, our children and our grandchildren, have to live with that deal. Why should we rush into an agreement that we don't know enough about and we don't have all the information at our fingertips? If this is possibly the best deal, what is the big rush?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we hear about Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec and Newfoundland and Labrador, and we had a little history lesson on Joey Smallwood, the former Premier of Newfoundland, who got into a deal with Quebec, and from what we can understand that deal with Quebec wasn't the greatest deal for Newfoundland. So do we, the people of Nova Scotia and the Opposition Parties over here believe that Newfoundland and Labrador is going to get the same deal again, that we're going to be the beneficiary of this deal and Newfoundland and Labrador is not going to be the one that benefits the most?</p>
<p>We hear of a thousand jobs, we hear of a thousand jobs here, we hear of a number of jobs there, but no one can tell us what the jobs are going to be and where they are going to be. Most of the construction in this business is going to be in Newfoundland and Labrador. We may have some upgrades to our power lines here and where the power comes ashore, and I look forward to that happening in my constituency and the constituency of the Victoria-The Lakes area where that power is going to come ashore - and if it creates us 10, 15, 20, or 100 jobs, that's great. We know that the cost of the project has already gone up. There hasn't been a shovel stuck in the ground yet, there hasn't been a key piece of cable laid in the ocean, and the project has gone up, but that's not going to be reflected in our power rates?</p>
<p>The aim of this is noble, to give the people in the position the information so they can make the proper decision. Unlike the lepers we're asking people to step back, hear the information, and make a proper decision. The Liberals have their plan on power and it's debatable - is it good or is it bad? We don't know that; we hear it's bad. We have our position on power rates - is it good or is it bad? We don't know that either; we think it is and that's what we're pitching to the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We're hearing the numbers. We're hearing the numbers of what it's going to cost and how much it's going to cost to construct, and all the job numbers. But the numbers we want to hear - how much is it going to cost us as consumers and ratepayers when that power gets to our households? - we're not getting that. They can give us all the numbers and all the numbers that they want, but the numbers Nova Scotians want to hear - what is the final cost, what is it going to cost you the consumer, or me the consumer, and everybody in Nova Scotia on their power rates?</p>
<p>We support any project that's going to give us greener and cheaper power - any project. We'll live within that means. But if we're not hearing that cost - and we're not hearing it - why should we support it? If it's not the best deal for Nova Scotians, then we don't want to support it.</p>
<p>Then we heard the talk today again about our dirty coal and how the price has gone up when we changed from oil to coal. At the time, it was a cheaper alternative. The price of coal is going down again. We talk about greenhouse gas emissions. We have an institution, the sustainability institution at CBU, and if Muskrat Falls and the Maritime Link project is not the best for us, let's spend that money in CBU and develop a technology to burn coal cleaner. We know it can be done. It has been done at Point Aconi. The price of this project has already gone up, and there hasn't been a shovel put in the ground yet.</p>
<p>The plan in raising power rates - we want to freeze power rates and buy renewables at what we can afford. Can we trust the NDP to do what's best for this province? We know that's not the case already. Their so-called commitments - or as we like to say, promises - they didn't keep them. Can they make decisions that are good for the Province of Nova Scotia? We haven't seen that yet.</p>
<p>People want to look at the full slate of questions and make the tough decisions on whether this is a good deal or not. We know the interveners are calling for more time, but the Maritime Link Act is making it tough for the URB to make the decision that we need to hear. It's tying their hands on what decision they have to make. They looked at comparisons between different forms of power production in the province, but they lumped two or three sources together and they didn't study them all together.</p>
<p>We heard from Mr. Dalton, and we heard how reliable he is, and I don't doubt that. But when you make a phone call and ask for a price and don't check into what a negotiation price would be, that's not the best thing for this province. The government set those regulations that would not allow the URB to extend the time frame to make the decision that may be best for the Province of Nova Scotia. We know, as Nova Scotians, we need to know what the cost will be and what the end cost will be. We don't know those costs. How can the URB make the proper decision?</p>
<p>I heard earlier about <b>Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec</b>, how it's now the so-called bogeyman, but I remember back last year when the shipyard contract was being talked about. At that time the independent NDP Leader stood in a CTV studio with the Premier standing behind him - or her - and they talked about how great a deal it would be if we shared that shipyard contract around with the rest of the country. Although the Premier didn't say anything at the time, I could see him in the background with his heading nodding up and down, yes, that would be a great deal.</p>
<p>Now they don't want to work with Quebec to give us the proper power, where we can buy power off them. We don't want to do that. We don't want to talk about where we can get the cheapest power. We just want to talk about where we can get a power supply that's green, stable - not necessarily cheaper, stable. We're not saying that's probably not the case, but I'd like to see this government give the URB the time they need to make the proper decisions, and if they think it's the right project, the URB will come up with that decision. If they're not scared to hear what the URB will have to say, give them the time to allow that.</p>
<p>When we consider Muskrat Falls, we're talking about a 35-year project that will have total costs, right now, of between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. When considering those facts, why does this decision need to be rushed through? We know the production of power is not going to take place for a long time yet, and I can't see the urgency of passing a bill or allowing the URB to make a decision within six months. So it would be our decision to let them make the decision that is best for the Province of Nova Scotia. Nobody knows if it's a good project or not, we're hearing from all kinds of interveners and we want them to have the time, the URB to have the time to make the decision that's proper for Nova Scotians and make sure that we do get the cheapest, greenest and stable energy rates.</p>
<p>We don't know what that is, so allow the people in power to make that decision. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable member for Victoria-The Lakes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#acb2d4c0-ea37-4793-a6c1-bd38fac2108d"><from>MS. PAM EYKING</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. First off, I want to commend you and my esteemed colleagues from both sides of the House on your bids to successfully secure seats in Province House. I also want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow candidates in this election: John Frank Toney from Eskasoni, who ran for the NDP; Stemer MacLeod, who ran as an independent; and Keith Bain, former MLA for Victoria-The Lakes, who just happens to be my country neighbour - a fine gentleman and a true good community member. (Applause) We all ran clean campaigns, and no matter what the outcome, we can hold our heads up high.</p>
<p>I cannot express enough gratitude for the hard work my campaign team put into winning this election. The names are so many I fear that if I begin to list them I will leave someone out. From my drivers, headquarter workers, canvassers, and executive members, each helped to secure my seat in this House. They were the wind at my back, the candle in the window, and they kept me going along my vast riding of Victoria-The Lakes.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I grew up just across the water, a Dartmouth girl, with my two brothers, Scott and Dan. Our dad worked just down the road from here at the Department of National Defence, and Mom did a variety of things to supplement our income. She brought in children of parents who went out to work, she crafted, and she had four trade students boarding in our basement of our small bungalow on Erin Drive.</p>
<p>After graduating from Prince Andrew High School I took a trade, because although I was fortunate enough to benefit from a progressive early childhood learning program at Mount Edward Elementary, universities of the day were not quite ready to accommodate dyslexic students. I wanted to be a social worker. I wanted to help people. It was that early childhood learning program, some fabulous mentors, my dad's inherited thirst for knowledge, and my mom's sense of determination that allow me to be standing here reading my speech in this historic house amongst my distinguished colleagues today. (Applause) That, Madam Speaker, and spellcheck.</p>
<p>During my teen years I was swept off my feet by a wholesome, hard-working second-generation Dutch Cape Breton farm boy. We married young, and I moved to his community on Boularderie Island in Cape Breton, an island within an island. Together we took a small vegetable farm and grew it to over 300 acres. Our staples were carrots, cabbage, and turnip, but we eventually introduced broccoli and romaine lettuce to the Cape Breton market. Soon our farm went on to sell produce all over North America. I did the books and the marketing, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This included payroll for, at times, well over 60 people, as well as TV and radio ads that featured local acting talent such as Bette MacDonald. We were the first to do in-store taste tests and promotions, Think Cape Breton First started at my kitchen table. I quickly became passionate about nutrition, especially in young children. I went into the schools to demonstrate the importance of healthy eating by showcasing a teaching tool called Reach for 5 to 10 Fruits and Vegetables a Day. Life was busy, it was fast, it was intense.</p>
<p>In a nine-year span, Mark and I had four wonderful children: Mieka, Joshua, Bethany and Jonah. Those kids worked alongside us on the farm from a very early age and to this day they have a strong work ethic. I could not be more proud of these four incredible young adults. Each of them is extroverted, intuitive and very well rounded. We adore their husbands Wade and Christian, fianc&#xE9; Natalie, and our eight-week-old grandson Ryker. Our family is growing and I could not be more delighted.</p>
<p>In 2000, on a rainy Fall day, a couple of people came to our back field where Mark was cutting broccoli with a crew of about 30. They asked him to run for the federal Liberal Party in an election that was only weeks away. Mark had strong reservations about saying yes to this opportunity, but I encouraged him to give it a shot. In spite of our busy lives, together we shared a strong passion for our community. He was already involved and I did my part by keeping our bustling home life running smoothly, a priority for us both. Mark was successful in his bid and we never looked back.</p>
<p>Just before he was asked to run federally we did some work in Panama, introducing a greenhouse method for growing seedlings to protect them from the heavy rains. We went back two years ago to check on them and I am proud to say they are thriving. They now have over 100 greenhouses. Like yourself, Madam Speaker, I did not plan my life for farming or politics, but most of all I am indeed so very grateful for the experience and the opportunity. Most of all I am grateful for the opportunity I had to raise our children in one of the most beautiful parts of the world and don't take my word for it, take it from Travel and Leisure magazine, which in 2011 rated Cape Breton Island the number one destination in North America.</p>
<p>When several months ago I was asked to represent the proud, hard-working, kind people of Victoria-The Lakes, Cape Breton, I saw it as my chance to help. Victoria-The Lakes has been very good to us and I'm grateful for this opportunity to give back.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, let me take you on a drive around my riding. It's over a four-hour drive to cross and eight if we choose to loop back this evening, so buckle up, sit back and pay attention because alongside its incredible, breathtaking beauty, at any moment you may see a deer, a moose, bear, fox, eagle, coyote or quite possibly, as I did on my drive home last week, a whale.</p>
<p>The riding I represent is vast not only in square kilometres but in the great diversity of its people and industry here on the Island. There are so many amazing things happening in this community that I am bound to forget a few so I must apologize in advance if I leave anything out.</p>
<p>Our journey will now begin on Boularderie Island, where the tide comes in and out on the north side of the Island twice a day as the Bras d'Or Lakes meet the Atlantic Ocean. When we drive through Millville, you'll come across one of Victoria-The Lakes's thriving industries: Eyking Farms, our family farm. It is one of the biggest in Atlantic Canada. It sponsors many community events that bring people from communities all over the Island. The summer's Eggfest and Fall's annual pumpkin weigh-in bring crowds in from not only the mainland, but all across Cape Breton Island.</p>
<p>We'll move onto Englishtown where we will begin our journey up the Cabot Trail, home of Cape Breton's giant, Angus MacAskill. Englishtown is also known for its annual mussel festival. These mussels are harvested right there in the community. When we cross over the Englishtown Ferry, we start the journey to the Cabot Trail where another trail lies, the Artisan Trail. You will be sure to stop into the small local businesses which display the unique talents of the people in the riding. There are Leatherworks, Glass Artisans Studio and Gallery, Wildfire Pottery, Sew Inclined, and Salty Rose's to name a few.</p>
<p>The Cabot Trail is a thriving tourist destination which boasts opportunity for many outdoor adventurers. The hiking trails in the region are world-class and draw in tourists from all over the world. Not only are you able to take in the majestic views through the immense hiking trails but you are also able to take in kayaking, whale watching, amongst countless other outdoor activities. If you're feeling up to it, you can take a trip up the steep trail of Franey and take in the incredible view overlooking the entire Clyburn Brook canyon and the Atlantic coastline. The view from on top of this 430 metre elevation offers a breathtaking view of most of Ingonish and Cape Smokey. We can also take a trip to the Highland Links for a round of golf. The course has been rated as one of the top 100 golf courses in the world by Golf Magazine.</p>
<p>Victoria-The Lakes is home to many industries, fishing being the largest one in the region. There is no doubt that the seafood industry is vital to Nova Scotia's economy and it's extremely vital to the rural communities within the riding of Victoria-The Lakes. The seafood industry in Nova Scotia is worth $1 billion. Within the communities in my riding, many people depend on the seafood industry for their main source of income. Those fishers who live in the northernmost part of the province, in Neil's Harbour to Bay St. Lawrence - these individuals help to maintain their small communities so that many others can come and experience the majestic beauty that they have to offer.</p>
<p>If you travel to the northernmost tip of the province, you'll arrive in Meat Cove - probably the smallest community in the riding. The community is home to the Meat Cove Moose Hunting Outfitters owned by Hector Hines, first cousin to my esteemed colleague, the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie. Mr. Hines runs an eco-friendly hunting company that is located in the designated non-motorized moose-hunting area. The guided hunt is carried out through the use of horses. These horses are used to carry in the hunters' gear and carry out the moose. The small community of Meat Cove may not be Halifax but the community saw over 4,000 travellers from around the world visit there last summer.</p>
<p>As we exit the Cabot Trail we will come to St. Ann's and the Gaelic College. The Gaelic College is very effective in maintaining and preserving the Gaelic language and culture. When we move on from St. Ann's, we'll travel into Nyanza where Big Spruce Brewery is located. Big Spruce Brewery is Nova Scotia's newest micro-brewery, which brews all natural unfiltered, unpasteurized organic beers with such unique names as Kitchen Party Ale. You can stop by at the brewery to buy a refill, a 1.89 litre growler, or stop by the Bras d'Or Yacht Club in Baddeck to grab one on tap.</p>
<p>As we drive into Baddeck, you will see many boaters. They sail through the Bras d'Or Lakes. The town is driven in the summer by the tourism industry. The Bras d'Or watershed is now recognized as a UNESCO biosphere reserve. While in Baddeck, visitors are encouraged to come and explore the Alexander Graham Bell Museum and see what Mr. Bell has contributed to society. These contributions include amongst many, the telephone and the first flight within the British Empire. When we drive through Middle River, you can make a stop at Finewood Flooring &amp; Lumber. Most of the lumber that is delivered to this plant is from Nova Scotia sawmills. The flooring company has been in business since 1982. The hardwood is kiln dried and is top quality.</p>
<p>Travelling on to Iona, we'll pop into the Highland Village, which is an outdoor living history museum displaying the story of Gaelic settlement in Nova Scotia. When we leave the Iona peninsula, we'll come to Christmas Island where more than 15,000 letters and packages a year come through to be stamped with the official Christmas Island postmark. The post office itself attracts people from all over as they stop by to purchase these one-of-a-kind Christmas postmarks.</p>
<p>From Christmas Island we'll travel on to Boisdale, which boasts its annual pancake breakfast. Pancakes are served with Highland Gold maple syrup, the local maple syrup and products producer.</p>
<p>Driving through to Frenchvale, you will come across Talbot House. Talbot House is a recovery centre for those struggling with addictions. Father John G. Webb founded the facility in 1959. The facility has helped men from across Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada through recovery and rehabilitation. The centre has helped hundreds struggling with addictions through its over 50 years of service.</p>
<p>As we move on to Point Aconi, we'll come across Lakewind Sound Studios, owned by Freddy Lavery and Gordie Sampson. I am proud to say Lakewind is just a 15-minute drive from my home. Lakewind Studios is an award-winning facility which has hosted such musicians such as Rita MacNeil, the Barra MacNeils, Jimmy Rankin, Natalie MacMaster, and Matt Minglewood. Fred was just presented the Maritimer of the Week Award for his contributions to the Maritime community by CTV News Live at Five. The studio became part of East Coast music history when it was established in 1996. One cannot forget the co-founder. Gordie Sampson was the recipient of a Grammy Award for Carrie Underwood's <i>Jesus, Take the Wheel</i> in 2007.</p>
<p>Victoria-The Lakes is proudly home to two First Nations communities, Eskasoni and Wagmatcook. Eskasoni is home to the largest Mi'kmaq community in the world, and has been able to keep their culture thriving through generations as they are also home to the largest Mi'kmaq-speaking community. The community has been a leader in renewable energy, where its wind turbine was the first net-metered wind turbine of its size installed in Nova Scotia. Wagmatcook First Nation has been moving quickly into educating the youth of their community, where they have helped in the funding of a new NSCC campus that will open in April. The community has partnered with Nova Scotia Community College so that it can offer more opportunities for their community members.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Cape Breton as a whole has been decorated with numerous awards in the past, and continues to be recognized as one of the wonders of the world. In 2011, Cape Breton Island was rated the number one island destination in North America by Travel and Leisure magazine. That same year, we were rated the number three island destination in the world. These accolades show that Cape Breton is a destination of true beauty, one we should be investing in. It is our province's largest tourist destination.</p>
<p>The Cabot Trail, which rests in my riding, was ranked ninth in the world for cycling. Cape Breton has been recognized as one of the most charming Fall islands, and if you are lucky enough to come see us during the Fall, make sure to take in the numerous music festivals put on through the Celtic Colours.</p>
<p>Cape Breton is full of majestic wonders. It has received many acclamations and awards cementing its status as one of the most majestic islands in the world. One would be hard-pressed to find people anywhere who are more proud, strong, generous, hard-working, talented, and quick with their humour and a hand. I am lucky enough to represent Victoria-The Lakes in the Legislature, where my riding is filled with reasons that help to explain the acclamations awarded to Cape Breton. If Nova Scotia is Canada's Ocean Playground, then Victoria-The Lakes, Cape Breton, is its theme park.</p></speech>
