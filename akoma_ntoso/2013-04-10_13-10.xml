          <p>The honourable Government House Leader.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the many small businesses in our province that are focused on being innovative and creating jobs in their communities to move our province forward. Our government is committed to creating a competitive economic environment where entrepreneurs can succeed and businesses can grow. Our government will refocus its attention on small business. We need to give these business leaders the tools to grow and create jobs, and then get out of the way and allow them to prosper.</p>
<p>We are committed to doing this. We know Nova Scotians have the skillset, the drive and the entrepreneurial spirit to succeed, not only at home but internationally. We will be there to support them, not get in their way. We want to build on the success of our small businesses.</p>
<p>Today I am pleased to announce that 51 small and medium-sized businesses from communities throughout Nova Scotia will benefit from the Productivity and Innovation Voucher Program this year. Both Opposition Parties will know that this program helps small businesses get to the next level in their growth by helping them develop new, innovative products and services, or get a new product or service to the next stage, or even to market.</p>
<p>We are lucky to have the broad depth of talent in our post-secondary institutions in Nova Scotia. This great program helps to build and strengthen the link between small business and Nova Scotia's universities and colleges - a relationship that benefits both sides.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, c'est avec plaisir que j'annonce aujourd'hui que 51 petites et moyennes entreprises de partout en Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse profiteront du Programme de bons pour la productivit&#xE9; et l'innovation. Les deux partis de l'opposition savent que ce programme facilite le passage des petites entreprises &#xE0; un autre niveau de croissance en les aidant &#xE0; concevoir de nouveaux produits et services novateurs, ou &#xE0; amener un nouveau produit ou service &#xE0; l'&#xE9;tape suivante, ou m&#xEA;me &#xE0; le mettre sur le march&#xE9;.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, nous sommes chanceux de pouvoir compter sur le vaste r&#xE9;servoir de talents dans nos &#xE9;tablissements postsecondaires. Cet excellent programme aide &#xE0; b&#xE2;tir et &#xE0; renforcer le lien entre les petites entreprises et les coll&#xE8;ges et universit&#xE9;s de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, une relation qui profite aux deux milieux.</p>
<p>Our academic institutions have people with a lot of know-how and expertise that small businesses can use to grow their operations. I want to acknowledge and thank them for their vital role in this program and their hard work and dedication to helping small businesses grow and flourish.</p>
<p>This program offers two tiers of vouchers or credit notes. The first tier provides businesses with vouchers or credit notes of $15,000 for professional services and advice from academic institutions in areas such as applied research, engineering services, field testing, prototyping, product design and feasibility studies to help move a new product or service to market. This year, 41 companies are receiving these vouchers.</p>
<p>The second tier provides vouchers of up to $25,000 to businesses that have previously received a Tier 1 voucher so that they can build on the work they did with the first project. These vouchers are being provided to 10 businesses this year.</p>
<p>The 51 businesses are located throughout the province in communities such as Yarmouth, Saulnierville, Mahone Bay, Canning, Bible Hill, Antigonish, Dominion, Cap Le Moine and many, many more. They do work in a wide range of economic sectors in our province, from agriculture, agri-food manufacturing and fisheries to clean technology, consumer manufacturing, ICT and life sciences.</p>
<p>These businesses are great examples of the entrepreneurial spirit that exists within our province. Earlier today, I had the great pleasure of meeting representatives of many of these businesses and hearing about the exciting projects that they will work on with our universities and colleges. I also met many representatives of the nine universities and colleges in Nova Scotia that participate in this program as well.</p>
<p>Small businesses aren't simply a part of the economy; they are the backbone of our community and our economy. It's the entrepreneurial spirit that creates jobs in every community across Nova Scotia, and it's that spirit that we have to unlock to support economic growth in our province.</p>
<p>M. le Pr&#xE9;sident, les petites entreprises ne font pas simplement partie de notre &#xE9;conomie ; elles sont la base de notre &#xE9;conomie. C'est leur esprit d'entreprise qui cr&#xE9;e des emplois dans chaque localit&#xE9; de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse, et c'est cet esprit que nous devons laisser libre pour appuyer la croissance &#xE9;conomique dans la province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to be able to introduce representatives of many of the businesses receiving vouchers and the post-secondary institutions that are partnering with them who are in the gallery today. Many of them are in the east gallery, and since we did not keep track of each one, I will run through the list of the 51 recipients.</p>

We're extremely proud of the work they do, and as a department, we're extremely proud to have been able to support them through this investment today.

RAMONA JENNEX</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to talk about an announcement the Premier and I made this morning regarding the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development's new Early Years branch. This announcement shows that our government is committed to ensuring Nova Scotia's youngest citizens have the supports they need to reach their highest potential, and we have come up with a plan to do so.</p>
<p>I've talked to many parents and grandparents, and they tell me that the health and education of their children and grandchildren needs to be a priority, and that the success of our province depends on the foundation our young people get early in life. I could not agree more. I'm pleased to say that we are improving the future success of our young people through a greater focus on the early years, the basics, and safer and better schools. The Department of Education has expanded its mandate to include child development and is now the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental philosophical shift in how we do our work. Research shows that the years from birth to age six are the most important in a child's development. The province provides more than 200 programs and services to support children in those early years. Unfortunately for the average family, though, finding out how to access these programs and services can be confusing and frustrating, and sometimes opportunities are missed or the services are found too late.</p>
<p>The system has to be easy to navigate and responsive to the needs of our families. Over the past year the province has done a lot to develop a plan that simplifies the support system for parents and puts the focus back on families and children. Hundreds of Nova Scotians provided input and ideas on ways to improve and make life better for our children. The plan is about bringing expertise from across government into one team - a team that will meet the needs of families with young children.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our Early Years Advisory Council co-chairs, Anne McGuire and Mary Lyon, and all the council members for their hard work and recommendations. I would also like to thank all Nova Scotians who took the time to attend focus groups, fill out surveys, or send us their ideas and their suggestions.</p>
<p>By working together, our government has come up with a plan. The province has created a single team of professionals and experts in child development to better support our children. That team will comprise the Early Years branch of the new Department of Education and Early Childhood Development.</p>
<p>Families also want a place in their own community where they can go to get the support that they need. The province has had great success with SchoolsPlus, and we are adopting the same approach with the new Early Years Centres. These centres will bring programs and services into one comfortable, accessible spot in the community where families will find it easy to get the support that they need. While more details of these centres will come in the future, I can tell you that these will be welcome resources in communities.</p>
<p>Based on the needs of the community, the Early Years Centres will provide support for young children and their families by offering seamless access to programs like early learning and child care, early intervention, and education for parents. Helping families identify issues early on is key to a child's development. The province will develop a comprehensive system to check in with parents when their children reach age 18 months, and again at 36 months, free of charge.</p>
<p>Early identification and supports are vital to giving our children the very best start in life, which is why we are developing a comprehensive, standardized 18-month and 36-month wellness visit, Mr. Speaker. This will be the complement to the current 18-month developmental screening included in the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this will ensure there is time to address developmental supports for children before they enter our schools and will help kids get off on the right foot when they get there. Our very youngest citizens deserve the best opportunities to be successful, now and into the future, and our government is making that happen.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we all have a shared goal of ensuring our children have the very best start in life, and your support and the work of the Early Years branch supports this. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#13787640-1a96-4b80-8d04-ce79410f4a22"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister's staff for providing a copy of her statement. I had an opportunity to attend the government's announcement earlier today regarding early learning. The announcement is very short on detail and the minister's responses in questions in estimates were incomplete.</p>
<p>As an educator, I am well aware of the importance of early assessment, early identification, and early intervention. Nova Scotia currently has an early intervention program designed to reach children with developmental delays, as early as possible. There are many sites around the province where parents can access that service, if they're prepared to wait.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, currently there are between 200 and 250 families waiting for that service. Many families have to wait between one and two years to get supports, if they ever get them; and some children age out of the program, waiting for service, and enter our public schools at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Education, Community Services, and Health and Wellness have stood idly by for the last four years as children with needs go without service. A more immediate solution would have been to adequately fund the current programs and to hire additional staff so that the wait-list problem could be addressed.</p>
<p>In addition to the early intervention services, we have 23 family resource centres across the province, some of which have multiple sites and a broad range of services for families and young children. Again, these services are under-resourced and understaffed. The Nunn report recommended breaking down the silos and have cross-departmental co-operation so that these services would be more accessible and designed for multiple needs.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is not a new concept. Let us remind ourselves about this government's lack of commitment to children. They have slashed funding from public education by $65 million over two years; the wait-lists in our public schools for speech-language and psychologists' assessments continue to grow; wait-lists for early intervention continue to grow. As well, this is a government that spent nearly $1 million on ads and promotions, while they watched these wait-lists grow. Although the government says that kids are a priority, their actions state otherwise.</p>
<p>Parents have no confidence that their children are a priority for this government. Today we heard about another plan but no action. The press release says that every Nova Scotian, including the very youngest, deserve the best opportunities to be successful. The Liberal caucus agrees with that, and that is why we have repeatedly asked this government to stop slash funding to education, to support the programs to meet individual needs, and to stop balancing the books of our province on the backs of our kids.</p>
<p>Folks at the announcement today were told that more details would be coming as early as next week. Would it not be more prudent, Mr. Speaker, to wait until the details were available, or was the decision to drag folks out again next week just a pre-election ploy? Nova Scotians deserve better.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I first would like to thank the minister for a copy of his remarks in advance. I was thrilled and honoured to be able to attend the reception this morning, and I was also pleased to see that a New Glasgow-based family business was on this list, known as the Cornect Family Farm, who are bee farmers and produce quite a large amount of honey as they supply their product throughout the whole province.</p>
<p>It was also interesting to mingle with a number of people. I met a lovely young couple who provide hops to Garrison Brewery, as well as two gentlemen from the Antigonish area who told me that they measure the pressure of your golf swing. I found that really interesting and I just want to say that I wish them the best of luck. I'm sure a lot of people would be interested in that.</p>
<p>Businesses with less than 50 employees make up a remarkable 97.4 per cent of the total businesses in our province. Small businesses are the backbone of the Nova Scotia economy, which is why I believe it's so important to create the best possible environment for them to thrive.</p>
<p>One of the things our Party campaigned on, as you probably all know, was eliminating the tax on small businesses for the first $500,000. I heard first-hand how much this would help those businesses struggling to get their feet on the ground - and I also look very much forward to a PC Government introducing that legislation after the next election.</p>
<p>On a serious note, though, our economy is dangerously weak. We need to help small businesses create jobs, not chase away business with unfair and expensive labour laws. Too many people in Nova Scotia are struggling to find meaningful work, and this law does not do anything to help create jobs. Nova Scotia lost 8,700 full-time jobs in the last four years; unemployment currently sits at 8.8 per cent in Nova Scotia, but it is much higher in rural areas. We need small businesses to do what they do best - and that is create jobs for families.</p>
<p>Another step the government could take to help small business is with energy rates - they are still 30 per cent higher than they were four years ago. In January rates will increase another 3 per cent, further hurting small businesses and people struggling to make ends meet. This government has no plan for balanced budgets, tax relief, or debt repayment - but they do have a plan for a new February statutory holiday. While our economy is struggling to recover from the recession, struggling to create meaningful work for Nova Scotia families, a holiday is not what we need. I look forward to seeing a job creation plan from this government in the near future. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'd first like to thank the minister for providing us with an advance copy of her statement today. It goes without saying that every member of this House would agree that giving the best possible start to our children is a priority. Today's announcement, although welcome, is lacking in details. Providing parents with the necessary resources to support their child as they grow is important, just as giving our kids every tool they need to succeed is. Unfortunately, we still don't know exactly what those resources will be, where the early centres will be, or what services will be offered to them.</p>
<p>Accountability requires development of plans that include goals and objectives, timelines and targets, review and evaluation. Unfortunately, today's announcement does not contain any of those things. To make an announcement of such high importance to families in this province but provide no specifics is premature. Parents all over the province will hear of this announcement and be left with unanswered questions. Child care providers across the province will hear the announcement and not know where they'll fit within the government's future plans for the early years.</p>
<p>Low family income is associated with poorer outcomes for children, and the longer the child lives in poverty, the more pronounced difficulties will be. Under the NDP, the cost of living has gone way up, causing further hardship, particularly for those low-income families. Unfortunately, today's announcement does not address any of the NDP policies that have pushed families into such difficult situations. The minister told reporters today that she was reviewing the funding model for child care centres. We have stood in this House and asked both the minister and her colleague, the Minister of Community Services, the exact question. We have now received a total of nine different responses. Quite frankly, that's unacceptable.</p>
<p>The services provided in the early years program will matter to every parent with a young child. It will matter to those who operate existing programs. By making an announcement about this fundamental shift, without outlining exactly what the shift is puts families and child care workers even further in the dark. This program is undeveloped, and the NDP have kept families guessing long enough. The government has not been forthcoming with details on the future of child care in this province, and they were not forthcoming with the details of today's announcement.</p></speech>

        <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I'd like to thank the minister for his advance copy and, probably just as important, thank these entrepreneurs who are here today.</p>
<p>Today I'll stand here to congratulate the government. There will be plenty of time for me toast you up, but I mean today is not really even celebrating the government, as it is celebrating these entrepreneurs. This is what today is about, Mr. Speaker. The Productivity Investment Program, or PIP as it is known, began a couple of years ago. Its real purpose is to help small and medium-size businesses to compete not only here at home, but globally.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use the words "global economy" out of context and it kind of loses its meaning but when we look at today's business world, it is not just what is happening here in Nova Scotia, in our province, but right across the country. Nova Scotians and businesses need to compete on a larger sale. Our province is not large, but I would use an old boxing term - this province has traditionally "punched above its weight."</p>
<p>In addition to helping business to be competitive, this program not only focuses on the physical tools needed to do the job, it also invests, most importantly, in people - improving their skills and advancing their careers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our caucus is pleased to see this program continue, because we believe it is a tremendous tool for small and medium-size business to grow and has true potential to stimulate the economy of this province in all regions. Thank you.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question from the honourable member. We are making changes currently to a number of different labour bills. In fact, we have consulted with the Labour Management Review Committee on one of those particular changes, and we appreciate their input. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. One of the big problems with the Labour Management Review Committee, the powerful committee that the previous government set up to recommend changes to labour laws, is that it excluded non-unionized employers which, by the way, is about 70 per cent of the employers of our province - the vast majority. Perhaps that's why, when he was in Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party said that this is the biggest problem he has with the NDP's labour laws. In fact, he said in this House, one of the things I think is the biggest problem with this piece of legislation, quite frankly, is the Labour Management Review Committee.</p>
<p>So I understand the government is new and is taking its time, but since this is one of the now Premier's biggest problems, I'd like to ask the Acting Premier, now that they are in government, why didn't they do what they said they would do and at least add non-unionized employers to the all-powerful Labour Management Review Committee?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. As the member can well appreciate, having been chief of staff to a new government, we've come into the House after about a month of being ministers. We have put forward three bills. They are important bills. They will not be the end of the labour legislation that this government will look at, but certainly we felt that these were our three priorities right now. Thank you.</p>

I will say that we would see those three bills as three opportunities missed to actually make this correction, a correction that the Liberal Leader and our now-Premier said was the biggest problem he had with our labour laws.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in their Speech from the Throne, the new government said they wanted to focus on the needs of small business. Small businesses like Egg Studios, for example, who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars defending themselves in the wake of the first contract arbitration that they face. They did not have a say in the design of these laws in the first place because, as a previously non-unionized employer, they were excluded from any review or recommendations about changes to the province's labour laws by the previous government. This is something that the new government could have done at least three times, by the minister's admission in this session, to address an obvious unfairness that exists in the labour laws.</p>
<p>I will ask the minister, when does the government intend to address this problem that the Premier said was the biggest problem in labour laws in Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I would note for the member opposite that the LMRC did not achieve consensus on first contract arbitration, so to suggest that the entire membership of that particular committee approved of the government's handling of first contract arbitration would be misleading. It would also be misleading, as the member has done, to suggest that the case in question was solely about first contract arbitration. In fact, the issues before the courts are about certification and not about arbitration.</p>

            <p>My question is for the Deputy Premier. Nova Scotia's economy lost 2,600 full-time jobs over the past year from November 2012 to November 2013, according to the most recent reports - and I'll table that for the benefit of the House. In Opposition, the Liberal Party was very critical of the NDP record on jobs. I'd like to ask the Deputy Premier when this government will release its own plan to get our economy going again and create jobs for unemployed Nova Scotians?</p>

Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that is of great concern to us on the government side of the House. We are certainly, and did in Opposition, and continue to watch the numbers and to see the impact on unemployment, to see the impact on our economy, and as Finance Minister as well seeing the impact on our budget.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do, Mr. Speaker, is turn the question over to our Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism because we have many plans to address the problems.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these were companies from communities throughout Nova Scotia, small, medium size companies, and those are the types of investments that Nova Scotians are looking to see from the government. As well, on top of that, we've already indicated a review is taking place of the economic development tools that we use, and as well changes are coming to the Credit Union Small Business Program, which we have seen great success from and hope to see much more success in the future. Merci.</p></speech>

I will say if creating jobs for Nova Scotians was a priority for the government, we'd actually see a plan to create jobs - an all-encompassing plan to create jobs - and not an attempt to take credit for programs that have been in place long before this government came into power.</p>
<p>We have a number of bills on the order paper; none of them represents a specific plan to get Nova Scotians working again. Clearly, it's not a priority for the government. Creating a February holiday might be a priority, because that's on the order paper; even appointing a Chief of Protocol appears to be a priority for the government, Mr. Speaker. But 2,600 Nova Scotians lost their jobs in the last 12 months. We're here in this House and there is no plan to create new jobs - the biggest issue that Nova Scotians are facing. My question to the Acting Premier, why isn't creating jobs for Nova Scotians a higher priority for this government?</p></speech>

            <p>Well Mr. Speaker, again, when you look today at the 51 companies that were here in the legislature, I'm at a loss to understand why the Leader of the Official Opposition would not want to stand and recognize the important investment that the government has made in these companies. At the same time, the people of Nova Scotia clearly said that they want to see accountability, accountability in how monies were being invested by our department, by the government, which is why we've undertaken that much-needed review to ensure we have the proper economic development tools. And we're also waiting for the results of the Ray Ivany commission on the rural economy, which will certainly as well give us a sense of exactly where we should be focussing our efforts to grow the economy of Nova Scotia.</p>

They are not looking forward to more studies and more research and more consultations. They need a plan today. They saw a Party in Opposition that was so critical of the NDP for all the jobs that were lost under their administration. They correctly, or assumedly, thought a Party that was so critical of another would have some plans of its own and would be addressing their needs in this, their first session, of a new government. But there is nothing here that represents a jobs plan for those 2,600 Nova Scotian families, or the tens of thousands of others that are unemployed.</p>
<p>This is the great issue that we all hoped we'd be dealing with in this session, and now we see that we're not. So if 2,600 jobs are not enough of a reason for the government to come forward with a plan to get our economy going, my question to the Deputy Premier is, how many more jobs have to be lost before we see a plan from this government to turn our economy around?</p></speech>

The absence of an international ferry in Yarmouth cost the region dearly in jobs, in businesses, and in human terms. The announcement in mid-November that a deal had been made for a new ferry restored hope to many, many people, but recent media stories have many people confused in the southwestern area.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, can the minister explain why the government did not make the first payment to the company responsible for bringing the ferry service back to Yarmouth?</p></speech>

In fact, we even saw that tour bus traffic on Cape Breton Island was reduced after the loss of the ferry service, so this truly had an impact throughout our entire province.</p>
<p>The deal we were able to negotiate back in November with our partners to restore the ferry service set out a number of conditions which had to be met prior to taxpayers' money being released. At this point, we continue to work with the company STM Quest, in the hope that they will continue to meet those deadlines and those requirements so we can make those investments and see that ferry service running again in 2014. Merci.</p></speech>

D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer, but as he also knows, the joint venture company STM Quest is scheduled to be operating that ferry service between Portland, Maine, and Yarmouth in May. That's just a few very short months away.</p>
<p>As we speak, many of the key marketing deadlines have been missed or are about to be missed - bus tour schedules, other important tourism initiatives. My next question to the minister is, what is the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism doing to ensure that all conditions of the ferry deal are being met and that the people of southwestern Nova Scotia are not disappointed yet again?</p></speech>

SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in this case, when we looked at the initial letter of offer, some of the changes that were made to that letter of offer - which I think is what Nova Scotians have asked for - is that as part of this agreement, the company needs to meet certain expectations before they receive government money.</p>
<p>I think we saw too many times in the past where that was the exact opposite, where the government money was what went first and then hopefully things were going to happen afterward. In this case, we've obviously done our best to protect taxpayers and ensure that the company is going to meet those standards first. We continue to work with them and become very hopeful of that.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to attend the annual meeting of the Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia as well, and during that time I was happy to announce that our department had granted an additional $1 million to the Nova Scotia Tourism Agency to do marketing and promotion in the eastern United States, which will assist the ferry service as well, no question.</p></speech>

Media reports have indicated that the minister has been writing the company about how the government will respond should the partners miss deadlines.</p>
<p>Really, my question is more of a comment to the minister: Let's get on with it. Let's get everything signed, let's get the announcements done, let's get the advertising done so we make sure that Nova Scotians will see that tourism traffic come across the Yarmouth ferry as soon as possible.</p></speech>

With an RCMP investigation underway into Senate expenses and possible misuse of taxpayers' money, polls show the majority of Canadians want the Senate abolished - something the NDP has long advocated for.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia's recent presentation to the Supreme Court referenced that the Harper Government has initiated, we spoke to the process saying that Nova Scotia feels the abolition of the Senate would require agreement of 10 provinces. However, we did not speak to what the province's position is with respect to the future of the Senate. My question to the Acting Premier is what is the government's position on abolishing the Senate?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to address this very issue just briefly with the media earlier and I'm sure that the Premier would be happy to address this further for the Leader of the NDP. The Premier has made it very clear in previous statements that we continue to see the Senate as an institution, an important body for the people of Nova Scotia. When we look at the growth in representation from Members of Parliament in Ontario and the western provinces that continues to dilute the influence of our members on the federal stage, the Senate gives us a guaranteed level of representation.</p>
<p>The Premier has also indicated that he is supportive of an elected Senate but the costs of those elections should be borne by the federal government, not the people of Nova Scotia.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question again is for the Acting Premier. In recent weeks the Legislatures of both Manitoba and Saskatchewan have passed motions calling for the abolition of the Senate. To quote the Premier of Saskatchewan, "&#x2026; when a building is falling down, sometimes you can't save it, sometimes you've got to knock it down completely and rebuild."</p>
<p>My question for the Deputy Premier is, aside from rewarding long-time Liberal supporters with expensive trips and lucrative paycheques, can the Deputy Premier provide a sound explanation for why Nova Scotians should not join with other provinces in calling for an end to the Senate?</p></speech>

<p>Whereas skaters from the Yarmouth Skating Club were awarded provincial titles - Shayleigh Doucet, provincial champion in the primary ladies A event; Kylie Landry, provincial champion in senior bronze ladies spins, and Chantal Surette, provincial champion in the senior bronze ladies event; and</p>
<p>Whereas Kylie Landry and Chantal Surette have qualified for Atlantics in the senior bronze ladies event and will be part of Team Nova Scotia at the Atlantics competition, and Yarmouth Skating Club member Sydney Newell is the first alternate in the junior bronze ladies event for Atlantics;</p>

There is no question that having a greater representation for Nova Scotia in the Senate is a benefit to us in terms of our influence in the country. Further to that, although there has obviously been a lot of trouble and scandal in the Senate, we have some very hard-working senators and I think it's worth noting. We've had senators who have led some very important studies.</p>
<p>We also don't believe that you make these kinds of decisions based on a resolution in the House or that sort of way. You don't amend history.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>MS. MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think the members in Saskatchewan and Manitoba would be very surprised that they shouldn't have passed that resolution in their Houses.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in 2012 Nova Scotian senators cost taxpayers - the 10 senators from Nova Scotia cost taxpayers $2.3 million for their expenses alone and $1.4 million in salaries; in fact, Canada's third and fourth most expensive senators were from Nova Scotia - Liberal Senator Terry Mercer and Liberal Senator James Cowan respectively. So my question again is for the Deputy Premier, does she really think $3.7 million for 10 senators was taxpayer money well spent?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, although we're here to talk about the Senate at the moment in this question, I think there are a lot of things that you could question about spending - and I would go back to the expenditure that was made to political staffers by the NDP after the election was over, increasing the amount of money spent to political staffers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, those are very difficult decisions, you know, to bring that up. While we're talking about the Senate, and I mentioned we have very good senators who are doing hard work, I think it's a good time to recognize Senator Don Oliver, Senator Gerald Comeau, who both are retiring, I think, this year and, in addition to that, Kelvin Ogilvie who is one of our Nova Scotia senators who was just recognized with a scientific award.</p>
<p>We have some very illustrious and hard-working people in the Senate and I think that the cost of democracy is just that, just as the cost of an election, when we run elections in this province, you cannot complain about the fact that we have a democracy.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I certainly concur with the Health Critic opposite that the EIBI program is extremely valuable to all Nova Scotians. At the present time we do have inconsistencies of wait times across Nova Scotia, and some of these are being addressed every year, but the timeliness of this program for young children is absolutely critical. We committed to doing a review of all of the recommendations for the autism strategy and, as part of reviewing those 51 recommendations, reviewing as well wait times for EIBI is part of that consideration.</p>

This family has two choices unfortunately - either send their son to school next year and become ineligible for the program, or to keep him home another year and wait for the services. This is an impossible choice for this family and one they should not be forced to make. The EIBI program was expanded so all eligible children will be offered the treatment.</p>
<p>My question is, this is obviously not the case, what can the minister say to ease the anxiety of families who have been unfairly put in this very difficult position?</p></speech>

            <from>MR. GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know in some of the districts across Nova Scotia there are training programs for parents that will assist them in supporting and helping the child until they actually get to meet a therapist. It's obvious in this district perhaps that wait-list and perhaps even for parental instruction is still very limited, but again this program is one that is very, very important to both the minister and this Party, who have advocated long and hard and moved autism from zero dollars to $4 million to $8 million. And doing what we can to support parents and children is, in fact, critical to that child's future.</p>

There are serious differences in wait times for the EIBI program between district health authorities. This program is to be based on the age of the child, but if the family in my constituency were to move to a different health authority, mere miles away, they may not have this problem.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, what will the minister do to address the wait time disparity between health authorities, and how can he ensure that children are seen based on their age?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an unelected, unaccountable Senate is not useful to Nova Scotians. That Senate sits, on average, just 90 days a year. It costs the taxpayers over $90 million annually to run.

          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Deputy Premier. In June of this year the four Atlantic Premiers initiated a pan-Atlantic initiative, aiming at determining the impact of recent changes by the federal government in the EI Program, or Employment Insurance Program. Last week we learned that the new Liberal Government ordered CUPE's Danny Cavanagh removed from his position on the EI panel.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, if Mr. Cavanagh is representative of a large portion of Nova Scotia workers, which we know he is, and he has the professional background and expertise to speak on EI issues, I want to ask the Deputy Premier what is it about Mr. Cavanagh that made his participation on this panel so egregious to that government?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. The EI review that's going on - the panel that's looking at this - had several phases and we really want to thank Mr. Cavanagh for his help in Phase I because he had a great deal to do with what the consultation is going to look like.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the reason for the change in the composition of the panel really has to do with our reliance on seasonal industries and the impact of these EI changes on seasonal industries and that was why the current representative, who is going around the province on that panel, is somebody from the tourism industry.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>MR. CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in correspondence to Mr. Cavanagh, it was stated that Nova Scotia will be identifying a new Nova Scotia representative, as the Deputy Premier said, for the panel for the next phase of this initiative, and she just said it was from tourism.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to give you a little background on Mr. Cavanagh. He represents seasonal workers: the people who drive our school buses, the men and women who work in our nursing homes, the women and men who clear our winter roads. Mr. Cavanagh himself is a small business operator so all of these people will be affected by the use of this EI program.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Deputy Premier, given his background, why was he removed?</p></speech>

I want to first of all commend one of my colleagues opposite, the member for Sydney-Whitney Pier. I keep getting to new names down here, but I know a number of years ago he was involved with a petition urging the government of the day to look at, if not a ban of trans fat, perhaps a reduction. So I want to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>I know that in the department this is an important issue. It's one that I know in regard to the Nova Scotia school policy - the nutrition policy - that to make a reduction in all foods purchased that have no or limited amounts of trans fat, and the same way in the early childhood years, in our preschool, to have a dramatic reduction of trans fat. This is very much in the Thrive! program as well, regarding our schools, our universities, and our colleges, to be able to have reduced trans fat in our food. To finish off, I know that the more Nova Scotians want less trans fat in their food, this will impact on food processors as well.</p></speech>

I'm happy to hear that the department staff is reaching out to Maritime Steel, because it has been over a year now that the workers have been strung along in many ways for political reasons. The NDP Government effectively slammed the door on Maritime Steel by requesting information and then requesting more information, and then, only after a year of doing this, deciding to ask for a business plan, only to use it to request more information.</p>
<p>My point is that while all this takes place, the workers are losing hope. They are running out of EI and are facing the prospects of moving away. So we're losing jobs in rural Nova Scotia, and it's beyond the point of desperation for these Maritime Steel workers. These are good jobs in rural Nova Scotia, and so my question today for the minister is, will he commit to meeting with the owners and workers of Maritime Steel and outlining the process that he expects to be followed?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, again, we're certainly open to hearing suggestions on how to move Maritime Steel forward. But at the end of the day we need to ensure that if we are going to be asked to make investments, we are protecting taxpayers - something which I know the Leader of the honourable member's Party has been very vocal about. Therefore, the department has already clearly communicated to the proprietor what information they would require before being able to properly assess any requests for public funds to assist with that business. I can tell you that we would certainly be more than happy to receive that information and to be able to work and see what ways we could possibly see the reopening of that company and jobs in rural Nova Scotia.</p>

            <from>MR. HOUSTON</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I again thank the minister for his answer. The workers are suffering tremendous hardship. The workers that Maritime Steel would employ are skilled labour and they are good jobs, filled by the type of residents that Nova Scotia needs. The NDP Government seemed quite content to keep asking for information and then sitting back and waiting, and that may have been fine for them at that time, but it is not a reasonable expectation for the workers to just continue to wait. The workers are facing real deadlines and they can't just wait. The workers face bill payments and other types of deadlines, so I would ask the minister if he would be willing to commit to book a couple of hours in his busy schedule and sit down in a timely fashion and meet with the workers and the owner of Maritime Steel, possibly within the month?</p>

I think Maritime Steel is an unfortunate example of that. The member referenced the political realities of Pictou County at the time and as such, unfortunately, it is the workers who have been left to wait.</p>
<p>We have made it very clear, in communications with the owner of Maritime Steel, as to what exact information is required, what financial commitments have to be provided to the department before we are prepared to look at making an investment on behalf of the taxpayers of Nova Scotia - an approach which I believe the Leader of the Official Opposition should certainly support.

KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, on November 6<sup>th</sup>, the Department of Environment issued a directive to Northern Pulp to allow the department to closely monitor the company's progress on meeting the emission limits outlined in its operating approval, because the company was exceeding the operating permit levels 15 per cent of the time. This directive specifically requires monthly reporting on total reduced-sulphur emissions and detailed descriptions of the work being done on the equipment to further reduce emissions.</p>

The people of Pictou West are concerned about the effects of air pollution from Northern Pulp on their health, given that this facility is a major contributor of fine particulate matter of air pollution. As I am sure you are aware, particulate matter is now officially recognized as a carcinogenic to humans by the World Health Organization's specialized cancer agency, the international agency for research on Canada.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. EPA cites scientific studies that attribute fine particulate matter, PM 2.5 to a variety of negative health outcomes, including but not limited to, heart attacks, asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms. Children are particularly sensitive to this fine particulate matter pollution. Fine particulate matter settles on the soil and water, causing environmental damage.</p>
<p>My question, Mr. Speaker, through you to the honourable Minister of Environment, is the minister confident that his department is doing all it can to protect the citizens and the environment from the harmful effects of PM2.5? Does the department have a universal standard for particulate matter, specifically once again the PM2.5, that may be emitted by any one industrial facility?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, sexual assault service providers and advocates across this province have called upon this government to implement the sexual assault strategy to address the issue of sexualized violence. The Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act assured us in 2011 that the government was aggressively working on a strategy. Yesterday when questioned in the House on the sexual assault, the Minister of Justice insulted every Nova Scotian with his response to the question. So my question to the Premier is, where is the sexual assault strategy?</p>

DELOREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the ongoing concerns of the residents of Pictou - and I don't believe it is limited to the residents of Pictou West, Pictou East and all of Pictou County share those concerns - what I can say is that with respect to this particular operation, they are currently operating with a temporary approval that is up for consideration in April of the new year.</p>
<p>As we continue to put the environment and the concerns and the health of the citizens of Nova Scotia first, with respect to the review of the approval situation, approval granted to this organization, we certainly look at all aspects of the operation as it relates to the environment, and they will be considered as part of the approval process leading up to any action taken on that April renewal.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we know that Nova Scotia has the highest rate of sexual assaults in Canada, 40 assaults for every 1,000 people. Given the staggering rate of sexual assaults in Nova Scotia and considering they were aggressively working on it in 2011, my question is, why is there no urgency from this government to act to implement a strategy to resource outreach initiatives, to support victims and bring aggressors to justice?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. MACFARLANE</from><p>Thank you, minister, for your answers.</p>
<p>The second directive issued to Northern Pulp by NSE on March 8, 2013, required the mill to address the issue of particulate matter emissions. To do so, Northern Pulp identified that it would need to install a new piece of equipment, an electrostatic precipitator - the anticipated date of installation of this equipment is sometime in 2015.</p>
<p>Since directives are issued by NSE for non-compliance to operating permit conditions of a facility, it would appear that this second directive was in response to Northern Pulp exceeding its permitted values of particulate matter emissions. Since the World Health Organization has declared particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans, it's a deep concern of mine, not just for Pictou West but for all of Pictou County and beyond.</p>
<p>During the election campaign the Premier signed a declaration that said a Liberal Government will "&#x2026; insist on aggressive monitoring of the emissions from the plant." and that "&#x2026; a system for reporting this information be put in place." and any further assistance to the plant will be based on cleaning up the air emissions. I will table that document.</p>
<p>My question, Mr. Speaker, through you to the Minister of Environment is, will the minister commit, today, delivery on the Premier's election promise to aggressively monitor the amounts of a known carcinogen into the air, land, and water, and not make Pictou residents and beyond to wait two years for action?</p></speech>

We try to put these things in place in advance, where they make sense. We have done some of that already with respect to specialized medical personnel; in fact, right across the province, those who are health care providers have already received training to deal with people who are victims of sexual assault and we're going to continue to do that and not wait until there is an overall strategic framework to do that. I would say that work is continuing. The Leader of the Opposition would know that this is a well-organized community. They have been engaged with the government for some time on it. They have had support from the government to do some of the work they are doing in relation to this issue.</p>

Everyone, of course, wants the best for our children, particularly in the early years, but a true comprehensive program is both real and meaningful and accountable for results. The handbook known and called <i>Investing in Early Childhood Development</i> says, "Accountability requires development of plans that include goals and objectives, timelines and targets, review and evaluation &#x2026;" - I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier.</p>
<p>My question is, if the Premier is so serious about early childhood development, why are there no goals, objectives, timelines, targets, reviews, or evaluations included in today's announcement?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we're working with the McCain Foundation in relation to these Early Years Centres. They are designed on some of the best modelling anywhere, and the reason for this is that it requires actual consultation with communities to decide which services should be in each one of the Early Years Centres.</p>
<p>In other words, these Early Years Centres will be tailored to the needs that the community analysis determines, and it also means that they will be different - maybe different in one community than in another because, as you know, Mr. Speaker, the needs differ in different parts of the province. In fact, they can differ in different parts of a city the size of Halifax. So of course all of the measures that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is talking about will ultimately be part of our approach to the Early Years Centres. Right now, we are working with one of the foremost expert organizations in the development of those centres.</p></speech>

<p>Comprehensive early childhood development includes dealing with child poverty. It includes dealing with nutrition and brain stimulation, among other important factors. But under the NDP, the cost of living has gone up, causing further hardship to too many of our most low-income families.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, since we're talking about early childhood development, does the Premier realize that his own policies - raising taxes and power rates and making life tougher for low-income families - will also have to be reviewed if we're ever going to have a true comprehensive plan for early childhood development?</p></speech>

            <p>Thank you for the question. I'm not really clear on what the member is trying to get at, other than the fact that as the Premier had answered in an earlier question that a number of strategies have gone forward, a number of committees have met and work is being done across - and I'll give them one example: when we deal with the domestic violence court and all the componentry, and how we're measuring that and trying to get the feedback and the information from there and how to expand that program where the benefits are across the province and to address what we see as a very serious problem and concern in the province.</p>

The Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act said in this House on December 6, 2011, and I'll table that response: We are taking aggressive action. One would think that 16 months of aggressive action would at least result in a plan or a strategy to address this issue.</p>
<p>My question to the Minister of Justice is, what kind of aggressive action is the department taking, and why have we seen nothing addressing rape and sexualized violence?</p></speech>

We've taken sexual assault very seriously in the government, we recognize that it crosses many departments, so as the Minister of Health and Wellness the department has taken the lead, with my deputy minister, to work with deputy ministers from Justice, the Status of Women, and Community Services, and to work with stakeholders like the Avalon Sexual Assault Centre.</p>
<p>We've provided a number of grants now that they support Nova Scotians through anybody who comes to their programs or through a 1-800 telephone line, Mr. Speaker. We've supported programs like the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner in two parts of the province.</p>
<p>We know we need to improve services for those individuals who find themselves a victim of sexual assault, so we're working with those partners to move forward on a number of initiatives that we already have implemented and we're going to continue to move forward to ensure that Nova Scotians have access to the support they need, especially those individuals who might find themselves a victim of sexual violence.</p></speech>

          <p>Mr. Speaker, I move that the adjourned debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne be now resumed.</p>

        <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable member for Northside-Westmount.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's an honour for me to stand here in Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. Just a short time ago - two and a half years ago, for example - I was elected in a by-election to represent the people of Cape Breton North. With the changing of the boundaries during the last election, I took on a new role to represent the people of Northside-Westmount. With that boundary change I took on approximately 2,500 new electors and approximately 1,600 new households.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it was a real honour for me to go around during election time to meet the people of Westmount, Point Edward, and part of Coxheath and Balls Creek area, to see their concerns, to listen to their concerns, and to find out what mattered most in that part of the constituency. I found out that jobs, the economy, certain recreational facilities, and numerous other things in this part of the constituency are of the utmost importance to that area. Roads was a big part of the area. Infrastructure on recreational facilities, Legions, fire halls, all seem to be a big part of the concerns of that area. I'm hoping that through my time here, this next four years, we will be able to address a lot of those concerns and make sure the people of that area are happy with the representation that I may provide them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, going through the rest of the constituency, I found out the same thing. A lot of the things were jobs, the economy, and infrastructure. Legions play a big part in all of the constituency in my area. I have four separate Legions and an Army Navy Club that have a hard time keeping their doors open due to the high cost of power, the high cost of heating, and the dwindling numbers of members that are part of those organizations. I've been quite successful so far in obtaining some funding for different parts of infrastructure to some of those areas, and I look forward to making sure we continue those good working agreements.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, before I was elected first, I went home one day and I mentioned to my dad that I was going to look into running for politics, because the member in that area was looking at retiring and running federally. Of course, I got the results a lot of people got in here: was it something I was really serious about? The conversation that day was kind of colourful, if I could say the least, but the final advice I got was if I was going to do this, to do it well. I would like to think that because of this past election, being re-elected, the people of our constituency think that's actually the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, during that election, or before I was elected the first time, my dad passed away. My mom, who was a big part of my election the last two times, came to a lot of functions that I went to, and in this election she actually sat back and said this one here was a lot more fun because we were going around to different events and different circumstances, they were in the office doing things, and the circumstances in the air around the election were a lot more fun. So I would like to thank her for everything she has done during this election. (Applause)</p>
<p>There are a couple of other real special people during this election, Mr. Speaker, whom I have to mention - that being my beautiful wife, Jane. We've been married for 23 years now, and the last two and a half to three years were times that we spent real close together, because around election time she was there almost every day. The talk at home, of course, was all election campaign stuff. My two children, who are now 20 and 18, really took on the role of children of a politician. They were there every day. They were knocking on doors. They were handing out pamphlets. They attended functions where I could go and really took advantage of the time to help out and help us be re-elected. I have two sisters who live here in the city and both came home as much as they possibly could, donating meals and other time and effort to the campaign.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my CA, who has been with me since I was elected and has stayed on with me, is a vital part to my office running smoothly at home, and I want to thank him for that and for all that he did during the election. I had a great campaign team. We tried something a little different during this election, where we would try to save a little bit of money on the meals that we provided to our staff, our campaign team and members. So my wife and a couple of others in the campaign decided that they would try to get a commitment from six different people to make meals, or 12 different people to make meals for the six days and bring them in to try to save some money that way.</p>
<p>Although a lot of people probably lost a lot of weight at election time walking from door to door, it seems like most people in my campaign either stayed the same or maybe gained a little bit. So I want to thank everybody who did prepare meals. We had turkeys, we had hams, we had spaghetti. One of the members actually said that if he saw another Italian meal after this election, he was going to probably have to try to turn it down, but I know he at that time would never turn a meal down.</p>
<p>My campaign manager, my official agent, and numerous, numerous other people, I don't want to name them all, Mr. Speaker, because if I miss anybody, I don't want to offend anyone. I just want to say that I had the best campaign team in this province, I think, and to thank them from the bottom of my heart for what they've been able to do. It's an honour for us to stay, and to represent the great people of the Northside-Westmount area.</p>
<p>I had two opponents during that campaign. Both ran good, clean campaigns. Both are good friends of mine, which made it more difficult, because usually with a friendship you try not to be nasty to them, but I figure I count nasty as having to beat them, so I did my best with that. But they did run a good campaign. But the thing I did find during this campaign was the awareness of the election process. I found a lot of people were - I don't want to say ignorant to the process or ignorant to what was going on, but the awareness of an election and what democracy means to the people in the Province of Nova Scotia and Canada just seemed like it needs to be a little more polished, I guess.</p>
<p>Some people were damaging signs. Some people were taking signs and throwing them away. The work and effort for people to put those signs up and the cost of those signs seemed to be something that didn't seem to bother a lot of people. So we have to do something over the next four years to try and increase the awareness of what democracy means in the province and what it means for the people who put their name on a ballot to be able to go from door to door and put signs up in areas that they think are going to be beneficial for them to be re-elected and to make sure that people respect that, respect the financial cost, respect the process that we have to go through.</p>
<p>I do want to thank all current and past MLAs for the service they provided to this province. When you sit back and think of it, to be one of now 51 members in this province of 940,000-some, to represent the people in the province is a real honour. It's an honour for me and it's not an honour I take lightly. I will do my best over the next four years to represent the people in my constituency, but not only that - all the people in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>As you know, Mr. Speaker, for the first almost 25 years of my working career, I was a physiotherapist in Harbourview Hospital in Sydney Mines, which is a rehab hospital for the community and also a veterans' hospital. I will say that those 25 years didn't seem long to go by, and I realized at that time, during those 25 years, the challenges some people face. I want to commend you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment to the chair as Speaker. Knowing what obstacles you've overcome in your lifetime to get to this stage of the game, and again I want to thank you and congratulate you on getting to that position. (Applause)</p>
<p>As I said before, I'm the last MLA for Cape Breton North, which is kind of historic because there were a lot of good MLAs that came before me. Cecil Clarke, who held many Cabinet positions; Brian Young; a gentleman by the name of Len Arsenault. We've had good, good representation from Cape Breton, and I hope I can carry on that tradition and make sure we pick up that for the new people in the new part of the constituency that were represented by a member in this House who was here almost 20 years.</p>
<p>If you look at the constituency itself, it contains the communities of North Sydney, Sydney Mines, Florence, Bras d'Or, all along the beautiful ocean. It runs right around to Westmount, Coxheath, Point Edward, and runs along Highway No. 125 towards Sydney. If I get into the Westmount-Coxheath area, it has one beautiful provincial park, Petersfield Park. If you have the chance, or anybody in the Legislature has the chance, on Canada Day to visit Petersfield Park where there are thousands of people with entertainment, and food booths, and advertising booths where people give things away - the atmosphere there is a party atmosphere and it's a beautiful spot to spend your Canada Day and it's something I would recommend everybody get to see.</p>
<p>We also have in our constituency - the new part of our constituency - the Canadian Coast Guard College. I know they find that getting people locally to go there is a challenge because it's not really well known. It's a real hidden gem in our province. It provides great employment to the area. The recreation facilities they have there are great. What we would like to see eventually is a new Coast Guard vessel come into Sydney and report there. What that would bring to our economy would be amazing. I was talking to one of the skippers on CCGS <i>Louis S. St-Laurent</i> and says it would bring approximately $1 million to the economy of Cape Breton if we could do that. But we have to take small steps first. We have to hopefully get a training vessel there, and a little extra work done in the harbour.</p>
<p>We also have the new greenfield site that has great potential to bring our island back into the limelight again. If we can develop that into a great port terminal, we can look at boosting our economy and increasing the employment levels in our economy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we have two yacht clubs in our area. One of them is in Point Edward, and one is in North Sydney. Both are beautiful facilities. They house some beautiful vessels. To watch the Wednesday night sailing in the harbour around Sydney from some of the people who have their boats here - it's just amazing to see. People come from all over just to watch the beautiful sails in the harbour and watch the racing that is going on.</p>
<p>North Sydney has a great fishing history. At one time we had three fish plants in our area; at that time, North Sydney had about 8,000 people, or 8,000 residents, and three fish plants. The processing that went on there was amazing. The activity that was going on was absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>We have a ship repair plant that we're hoping will be resurrected in that area with the new shipbuilding contract here in Halifax, and that we can see that plant become vibrant again and that repair industry become vibrant, either providing material to the shipyards plants here or repair to the ships that these can't get because of the size of the contract.</p>
<p>We had a vibrant railway at one time. We don't have a passenger train anymore. There's a lot of people who can tell you stories about the passenger train from North Sydney to Halifax in their college days. It would be interesting to see if that would ever be something that could be brought back to life again.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we have a little town called Sydney Mines, which has a great mining history. I took part in the Santa Claus Parade there a couple of weeks ago, and it's one of the largest parades they've had in years and years. It's good to see the people come out to support areas. I was one of the elves - I had the Grinch with me &#x2026;</p></speech>

          <speech by="#13787640-1a96-4b80-8d04-ce79410f4a22"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we can all recall the advice that the Minister of Education received from Dr. Wayne MacKay and the warning to the minister that steps needed to be taken, immediately, to try to begin to address the problem of cyberbullying. That was in February 2012.</p>
<p>In the minister's own task force report, there were three recommendations that spoke to Internet service providers and the Criminal Code. The minister's own response to that report, through Bill No. 30, was silent on both of those issues. My question to the minister is, why would the minister ignore critical important recommendations that should have been part of her immediate response?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#b31db77c-006f-4f6e-ab57-0c449cb2d93a">
            <from>HON. RAMONA JENNEX</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, we have moved forward with the recommendations from the report and we have implemented an action plan with 40 actions in it. Many have started; many are in the process of starting, over the three-year period. We have more supports in our schools; 40 actions are underway in the Province of Nova Scotia to combat bullying and cyberbullying. I would like to say that we have had a very serious situation in Nova Scotia and I would like to say that our action plan is in place but if there are other areas where we can effect positive change, effective, research-based positive change, this government is going to move forward to do them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#13787640-1a96-4b80-8d04-ce79410f4a22"><from>MS. CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the recommendations that I spoke about that were in the task force report, speaking to Internet service and the Criminal Code, would have gone a long way to help this province. This minister has had ample opportunity - one full year - to respond to those recommendations and to those in particular. One recommendation, which was supported by the Liberal amendments to their Bill No. 30, that of course was defeated by the NDP; and again the amendments to Bill No. 102, again defeated by the NDP and included in the Bill No. 106, the Liberal bill, asked, "The Governor in Council shall direct the Minister of Education, the Minister of Justice and any other members &#x2026; to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada with the purpose of making changes to the Criminal Code (Canada) with regard to addressing inappropriate behaviour and bullying by electronic means, including Internet and cellular telephone use." I will table that.</p>
<p>Over one year has passed and only today has the Premier finally acknowledged that maybe there is a need to work with the federal government on the Criminal Code. This is one year too late. My question to the minister is, will the minister acknowledge today that her inaction has done nothing to help families bring bullies to justice?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, since the comment was directed towards the Premier, I would like to ask if it would be okay if the Premier could speak to that. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that none of those bills were defeated because they did not, in fact, come forward to a vote. The reality is that there is a constant, ongoing exchange between the departments here and the federal government about the kinds of changes that we see as necessary, whether it is with the Criminal Code or with other pieces of legislation. Certainly the Minister of Justice would have those kinds of conversations with his federal counterpart.</p>
<p>I would just point out that as it is now Nova Scotia is a leader in this country in its approach to cyberbullying and bullying, and has one of the best regimes anywhere in the country. We used a process - essentially a commission - to look at that issue and to thoroughly examine it. We took the benefit of that advice and we brought forward legislation and made policy decisions in that regard.</p>
<p>People in Nova Scotia should be proud of the record of the Government of Nova Scotia with respect to this. We acknowledge, and I hope everyone does, that things are always going to change, and more information will come forward. We will see events happen that challenge our ability to be able to deal with them, but we do not shy away from them. We accept that, and we work toward better and more complete answers.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, one of the more important recommendations of the cyberbullying task force, Dr. Wayne MacKay's report, was that cyberbullying, a new and devastating phenomenon in our province and around the world, ought to be defined in law, including provincially, where the consequences, including restitution, can be spelled out for those who engage in cyberbullying.</p>
<p>I will ask the Premier, in light of that report, in light of the bills that have been brought before this House, to actually put a definition of cyberbullying into law so people can recognize it for the offence that it is. Will the Premier commit now to defining cyberbullying in Nova Scotia law and spelling out the consequences for those who engage in it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out already, we have a constant ongoing dialogue with the federal government around issues like cyberbullying. Obviously if it is to be a criminal offence, then it must be defined in the Criminal Code of Canada, which would be something that - and I'm sure the federal government already has this on its radar, because I know that we have been working through the Department of Justice to bring these issues to their attention.</p>
<p>I know that the Minister of Justice is certainly aware that legislation needs to evolve to address new events, so that's what we're doing.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the time for dialogue is over and the time for strong action is now. There are many offences defined in law provincially, and cyberbullying should be one of them.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Speaker, the time has come to give our courts and law enforcement officials the power to confiscate cellphones, laptops, and other electronic devices when they are used as weapons against our own children. So I will ask the Premier, will he bring in legislation to give the courts and law enforcement officials the power to take away laptops and cellphones and other electronic devices when they are used in such a destructive manner?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I don't believe the jurisdiction of the courts is limited in that regard. Anything that is used in the commission of a criminal act, I believe, would be capable of being confiscated.</p>
<p>I take the question very seriously. What I want the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to know is that obviously a review of these matters is necessary. We are going to look at it in a comprehensive fashion, and we'll be doing so over the next little while.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer from the Premier. I will say that he may believe that the courts and law enforcement officials and others have all the tools they need, but they are not being confiscated now in these kinds of situations, and they should be. I hope he does bring a review and actual actions that we can all take together to stop cyberbullying in its tracks.</p>
<p>The MacKay task force was a comprehensive task force on the issue of bullying and cyberbullying. It consulted with a great number of Nova Scotians and produced a wide number of recommendations. Government has adopted them piecemeal, when in fact it represents a comprehensive whole.</p>
<p>I will ask the Premier, will he commit today to implementing all of the recommendations of the MacKay task force so we can together get on with the job of stopping bullying and cyberbullying and the effects that it's having on young people?</p></speech>

<p>There's a well-known area in Sydney Mines where they have a new fossil museum. Most of the fossils have come from areas in Cape Breton, from our long coal history and from the history of the ocean. It's just amazing to go through that museum and look at some of the fossils that are there and the date of the fossils that are around. They have a real challenge with funding to keep the doors open and the heat on. It is always a challenge. They run three museums, and they get funding for just one. That's something we're looking into for the future, to see if we can't make sure that these museums stay open and that they do provide our youth and our adults with insight into the history that we have in our communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the big challenges in our area, as it is in the rest of Nova Scotia - especially rural Nova Scotia - is jobs and the economy. People have to move away for work, since the closing of the coal mines and the steel plant and the fishing industry. When those people move away, families suffer, communities suffer. Because of that, we lose our best and our brightest people to other areas of the country.</p>
<p>We know that people in our area are proud descendants of steel-making families, coal-mining families, people who used to work very rich in the forest. Not only do we lose our best and our brightest but we also lose a lot of valuable volunteers - people who volunteer as coaches, mentors, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Girl Guides. When we lose those volunteers, we lose part of our community. We all know that in rural areas community is huge. People in our area know each of the volunteers. They go above and beyond everything that we can ask of them, and to lose them is just a real shame.</p>
<p>We have two very important festivals in our area. One of them is the Johnny Miles Festival. It is named after a two-time Boston Marathon winner from Sydney Mines - they ran in Sydney Mines. The story goes that he ran in a pair of sneakers that he bought at one of the local bargain stores for 20-some cents. He was up against a bunch of people who were running in the best of gear, in the best of clothing, and had the best of training. The rumour is that he ran that race wearing nothing but a pair of old shorts and an old pair of sneakers, so that is a tribute to how good a runner he was. That's why the festival was named after him. It's a great celebration of our coal history, and over the years this festival has grown.</p>
<p>We also have what they call a Bartown Days Festival, which celebrates the incorporation of North Sydney as a bar town. Funding is always a challenge; we're finding more and more people becoming interested in these festivals and it's always a challenge to try to increase the awareness and make sure the funding is there.</p>
<p>We know the challenges facing Nova Scotia, Mr. Speaker. They didn't wait while we were having an election - we heard the same thing before the election; we're hearing the same thing after the election. We want to see the government get on with their business; we want to make sure the government holds true to account to what they've promised Nova Scotians in the election campaign. We know that when the government succeeds, we - as individuals in this province - all succeed. We know that when the capital city of Halifax is booming, rural Nova Scotia will be booming. So we're hoping that Nova Scotia will rise up and be the province that it once was.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank all the people who were instrumental in my election and in the election of everybody here in this House of Assembly. I know I'm excited about representing the new constituency of Northside-Westmount, and I want to let the people in my constituency know that my door is always open, my phone is always on, and we will do our best to address the concerns of every constituent, no matter where they're from or what colour Party they represent.</p>
<p>In summary, Mr. Speaker, if I could, on the weekend while I was home I had the opportunity to confirm that on Boxing Day - last year I started hopefully that which will be a tradition for the next number of years, putting on a community meal in my community for people in the constituency, and people beyond, so that people can get together and enjoy a hot meal over the Christmas season. Again, I want to tell everybody that's going to be on again this year on Boxing Day, at the North Sydney Fire Hall.</p>
<p>Last year we had hundreds of volunteers. The two local grocery chains in the area, Sobeys and SuperValu, donated a lot of the food. The people in the area came out to volunteer and enjoy a hot meal. It's good to see the smiles on people's faces. It's a time of year when people forget all the problems that are in the province, and the world, and get together and unite as one and enjoy the company of each other. I hope that during this holiday season everybody here gets to enjoy some family and friends and have a happy holiday. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM. - SCH. REVIEW PROCESS: FLAWS - AWARENESS</heading>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, parents, teachers, and communities across Nova Scotia have been put through a heart-wrenching process reviewing schools for closure. Last week, after hundreds of hours of work, including community meetings and board deliberations, the Minister of Education stepped in and requested that boards call off these reviews.</p>
<p>Last year, on April 11, 2012, the Minister of Education refused to intervene in a review because, "Under the legislative process the school review is very clearly mandated and it is not to be interfered with by the minister. The school review process is a very clearly articulated process where parents and community have the opportunity on two separate occasions to offer their input to the process and to the board."</p>
<p>It seems that the minister and this government stood behind the school review process enough not to get involved last year, so my question to the Premier is, at what point did the government decide that the school review process was flawed?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, school reviews and the allocation of budgets and assets are the responsibility of the school boards of our province. We elect them - their communities elect them to do this job, and of course we support those boards in their work.</p>
<p>The review process in this province has been altered a number of times, as the Leader of the Opposition would likely know. Unfortunately, they have become increasingly adversarial, and we don't like that. We want communities to be able to make good decisions around the allocation of the assets that we have. (Interruptions) I'm sorry, is there a further question there?</p>
<p>I believe what we are attempting to do with this is we made the request to the boards - and it was a request - to suspend the current reviews in order that we might work with them to find a less adversarial way to do what it is that they are trying to achieve, which is to get the best balance for communities in terms of the assets, capital expenditure, and operating funds that they have to provide the best possible educational service.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Sydney-Whitney Pier.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the school review process is no more adversarial this year than it was last year. Yet last year the board and the minister and the government supported it. (Applause) School boards across this province last September went about doing their business, doing what they've been elected to do, as the Premier said, and they've been doing it to follow legislation that has been put in place by this government and reviewed by the Minister of Education back in 2010.</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia School Boards Association stated that the minister's request could be all but a moot point because of legalities on the board decision. Even before the association raised this point, boards, including the South Shore Regional, were skeptical that they could heed the minister's snap request. They simply can't afford to maintain schools' needs so they can stay open and pay teachers and students support.</p>
<p>The government has said they are not going to provide any more money to school boards, so my question to the Premier is, how is the Premier going to protect classrooms in the wake of the minister's about-face?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#81ace0ab-54e7-4b6d-8d48-6d416fbcd939"><from>MR. GORDIE GOSSE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's always a pleasure to get up on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne, to talk about your election and your riding.</p>
<p>Before the election we had 52 seats in the provincial Legislature - we went from 52 to 51. The one seat that was eliminated was the riding of Cape Breton Nova. That riding was held by three members of this Legislature since 1956. From 1956 to 1970 was, I say, the illustrious Percy "Pinky" Gaum for the Progressive Conservative Party, who was a World War II veteran and a prisoner of war, who represented it very diligently for all those years.</p>
<p>From 1970 to 2002 we had the Honourable Paul MacEwan who represented the riding for 32 years. Madam Speaker, Mr. MacEwan represented that riding for 32 years and he is the longest-serving member in the history of the Nova Scotia Legislature, with nine elections in 32 years. He retired back in 2002, and is still a good adviser for any Speaker or any MLA who sits here in the Legislature. I don't know if anybody will ever break that record of nine consecutive elections and 32 years in this Legislature.</p>
<p>Then it was myself going forward, representing Cape Breton Nova until the riding was eliminated by the Electoral Boundaries Commission in 2013 - but not before the community of Whitney Pier had its say. I think it was in August 2012 that we had a little meeting down at the Ukrainian Hall in Whitney Pier where the community showed up in great numbers to say that you cannot divide this most ethnically diverse community in Atlantic Canada in two when it has been a part of the riding for many, many years. So the Electoral Boundaries Commission had a change of heart and included the whole riding of Whitney Pier, which eliminated the top part of the old City of Sydney.</p>
<p>The riding now encompasses the six wards of the City of Sydney, which is Ward 5 right up to Ward 6, but on the upper part of the old riding in Cape Breton Nova, the commission at that time decided to go up Reeves Street, eliminating the seniors' home at Reeves Street where I have lots of friends and seniors who live there. They went down Upper Prince Street into the ward and up Centennial Drive, down Ranna Drive and up Carlton, and eliminated about 150 people out of the riding when they did that. The people up in that end of the riding, who live in the City of Sydney, are now represented by the member for Louisbourg-Sydney River-Mira - I think that's the new name of that riding over there. I might have missed a part of it there somewhere. (Interruption) So I was close enough, I guess.</p>
<p>It's always an honour and a privilege - it's my fifth election - to come back to sit in this House. You always remember one thing as an elected official: people may always doubt what you say, but they'll always believe what you do.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think it's important that we realize that the seats in this Legislature are owned by the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. They're not owned by the members of the Legislature, and who sits in these chairs will always be determined by an election.</p>
<p>Now I will get on to thanking some of the people. I know members stand in here and say, and I have such a list of people that I don't want to thank, but I'm going to name each and every one of them. I'm going to stand here with my time and say that, first, I would like to start with my campaign manager for the new riding of Sydney-Whitney Pier. I think somebody had asked, well, how did they change the names of that riding?</p>
<p>Well, many years ago, we had a bus that would come into the community. We only had one road into the community of Whitney Pier, and it was an underpass. In 1967 they decided they would build an overpass into that community - a beautiful community, Madam Speaker, with lots of people there of ethnic backgrounds from all over the world. You know, that place was once the industrial immigration capital of Canada during the coal mines and the operation of Sydney Steel, but again, my campaign manager, Nelina McGuigan Seymour, a little ball of fire - I think that was her fourth campaign where she was campaign manager, and realized the challenge that we had in front of us, realized what we had to do to get myself back into the Legislature, and realizing also that we were running against very, very capable candidates: the former councillor for the City of Sydney, young Derek Mombourquette, a very fine young man. I think someday he'll be sitting in this Legislature, when his time comes. He's a very fine young man. (Applause)</p>
<p>It was a pleasure. The candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party, Leslie MacPhee, a very nice young lady. You know, I had a lot of respect for Leslie. I guess it's not public knowledge that something that affects the human being in life is that Leslie was once living here in Halifax as a university student, but Leslie's sister died with cancer and left her nephew, an autistic child, who Leslie is now bringing up. She moved back to Cape Breton and put her career on hold to help her mother raise that child. It takes a very special kind of person to do that. So I had a lot of admiration for both candidates, Leslie being one and Derek Mombourquette being the other. They're both young people.</p>
<p>Someday this old fellow will step down and walk aside. I don't know if it will be in the next election - I'll make that decision with my family - but at the end of it, I think you have close to 15 years. So it's something that I'll think about, you know, unless I decide I'm going to run for the Leadership of the NDP and stay around long enough, but I would have to be hit over the head with something, Madam Speaker, for me to stay along long enough for that to happen, I guess.</p>
<p>Do you know what, I always remember when we first interviewed my constituency assistant a long time ago, Albert Crawley, who was a retired clerk in the military. Actually, he was Rom&#xE9;o Dallaire's clerk in Ottawa before he retired and moved back to Cape Breton. I remember them saying that one of the questions you always ask your constituency assistant - and I think they devised 10 questions when you interview people for a job as a constituency assistant - and the only person who ever answered in that question was one of the questions that I asked to put in it, which was, what is the main focus of your constituency assistant? I think the main focus of your constituency assistant is to get you re-elected. I think that's what his job is, to answer constituents, so I'm fortunate to have a good, hard-working guy like Albert Crawley, who retired from the military, moved back to Cape Breton, bought a home in Whitney Pier, and is now settled in and looking after his sisters and anybody in his family.</p>
<p>Then I go to my other constituency assistant. I have always had a part-time constituency assistant, which many MLAs - I have Keith Neville. Keith Neville recently was just here in Halifax for some medical attention, but Keith is back at the phones and back at his desk. Keith is quite a hard-working young man who does a lot of work on DVA. Keith does a lot of DVA for my office. We're probably one of the few offices in Nova Scotia that does Department of Veterans Affairs. We appeal them; we do them right to the end.</p>
<p>Keith is very upset about the recent announcement of the closure of the Department of Veterans Affairs in downtown Sydney. He feels that the services provided to those veterans - the one-on-one, hands-on services - will no longer be there, and travelling to Halifax or other areas to receive those services - Keith has a passion for DVA. My office has been fortunate enough - we even solve cases - the DVA in Miramichi, New Brunswick, Thunder Bay, Ontario for veterans - we've been very fortunate. Keith is. That's his forte.</p>
<p>Keith's father, Abby Neville, was the service officer for the Pier Legion for 55 years, and recently, when the Queen was here, his father was given an award because Keith's mom is a war bride from England. Keith's dad was given an award for his dedicated service to the veterans of Nova Scotia when Queen Elizabeth was here.</p>
<p>Then again, I guess I might as well go to thanking some family members. The better half, and probably the most important part, is my wife, Susan King. You have to realize that when you get into politics, the person you rely on the most is always your partner - your wife or the person you live with. I remember when I met Susan in Holland College, when I went back to school at age 35 to become a youth worker. I fell in love with Susan shortly afterward, and moved her back to Cape Breton. I'm always teasing her. My wife is a Miramichi girl, so I tell her that I moved her out of the Miramichi to take her back to Cape Breton to domesticate her, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, the minister did exactly what she should do, she waited for the completion of the process. It came to an end, I believe, on the last day of March. Within a day or so the minister made the request of the boards. That is as it should be. This year the boards will get more money than they got last year and this year they will receive the highest per capita funding in our province's history.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, if this process is flawed, the minister should have stepped in at the very beginning instead of putting communities and school boards through what is a very difficult and gut-wrenching experience.</p>
<p>I want to remind the Premier, Mr. Speaker, that the South Shore Regional School Board is not getting more money. Five out of the eight boards in this province have seen a reduction. Nova Scotians know this about-face by the minister and the NDP Government in the school review process is simply electioneering. If this government was truly committed to improving the school review process, it would not have waited until they were three and a half years into the majority mandate to do so. They would have funded public education so boards could have had the option of keeping schools open and supporting all students.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that the Premier has tried to balance the budget on the backs of children, Mr. Speaker, now he's playing politics with their education. Will the Premier admit to communities, teachers, parents and students that his government's request to call off the review was just an empty political manoeuvre, with no real commitment to help communities keep their schools open?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. What the people of Nova Scotia know is that in working with the NDP Government, we are always prepared to listen to them. It's their community. We take very seriously the responsibility that we find ourselves with in terms of the finances of the province but we balance those with our desire to improve services to our citizens.</p>
<p>You only have to look at this year's balanced budget where it is not only balanced financially, it is also balanced in that we are extending more services, like the Early Years Centres that we announced this morning, like insulin pumps, like putting more money back into the hands of senior citizens. These are all things that improve the quality of life in our province and the best thing the Opposition could do to support that would be to vote for the budget, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, on April 3<sup>rd</sup>, two days after the school review process was finished, the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development wrote to school boards to request the school review process for the year 2013-14 be suspended. It got some headlines. Later that day the same minister said she's not able to interfere and all she can do is ask the school board if they will honour the request, and I'll table that article. My question to the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development is, how will the school boards stop the school review process?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#b31db77c-006f-4f6e-ab57-0c449cb2d93a">
            <from>HON. RAMONA JENNEX</from>
            <p>The school review process for the upcoming year would start in October and end in March, so I've asked them to suspend putting identifying schools for the upcoming school year because it would be starting in October and ending in March, so I've asked for a suspension in the review process while we work through a better way. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Yesterday the president of the Nova Scotia School Boards Association said the minister's request has left them with more questions than answers. He said the Education Act dictates that the decision of boards with this regard is final, so boards have questions about whether they have the leeway to reverse this or not, and I'll table that article.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, does the minister honestly believe the school boards can do anything to stop the school review process and keep schools, already slated for closure, open?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#b31db77c-006f-4f6e-ab57-0c449cb2d93a">
            <from>MS. JENNEX</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, that is why I made the request of the board to suspend the process and to delay the decisions that were made in the current year. Thank you.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the minister put parents, teachers, students, communities, and school board members, through a nightmare process and then, at the eleventh hour, asked the school boards to do something she knew was not even possible. Some school boards had already made decisions about the fate of their small rural schools.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will she please stop spreading false hope to the Nova Scotians who were led to believe that maybe her announcement meant something, when it was really just political posturing to grab a newspaper headline?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#81ace0ab-54e7-4b6d-8d48-6d416fbcd939"><from>MR. GOSSE</from><p>I hear you.</p>
<p>I have two sons, my son Gordie, who is 37 years of age, and my son Daniel, who is 19. Quite a gap in between them, so it's two stages of my life, raising the two boys. My son Gordie currently lives here in Halifax, in Fairview. I don't know what riding he'd be in now, since the boundary changed. He lives on Rufus Avenue there in Fairview.</p>
<p>Then again, Madam Speaker, going back to - I have a great story in the campaign, and I think I'll drop that on today. I'm going to tell that story today about how there was a function on a Sunday afternoon. I think it was the member for Cape Breton West at that time - oh, no, his riding had changed to Sydney River-Mira-Louisbourg - and he had a function out there because Sheila Dermody - who is a good friend of mine - and her daughter Shelly, and Sheila's granddaughter Mallory were out to this function, because the member's son is married to Sheila's granddaughter Amber, and they have three beautiful children together. I don't know if it was the christening or something of one of the children that day, but there was a function out at the member's on a Sunday.</p>
<p>That evening when I came back to the campaign office there was a muffin for me on my desk. It was a beautiful chocolate muffin, but on that muffin in blue icing was "Vote Alfie." I really looked at it, and being a diabetic, I knew I couldn't eat that muffin, but I decided to have some fun with it. I'm not a Facebook guy and I'm not a Twitter guy, but I decided to take that picture with myself and young Mallory. We posted it on the Internet, and it said myself and young Mallory "Vote Alfie" with the muffin. A lot of people said - and I'm not a Facebook guy - but they said that picture got more hits than anything else in the campaign, to have that "Vote Alfie" muffin on my Facebook page. I also had a phone call the next day from the member thinking it was pretty funny.</p>
<p>We had lots of laughs over that. It's always good to have friends in the Legislature even though we're on opposite sides of our policies we believe in. But friendships go a long way in life when it comes to family. (Applause)</p>
<p>I have to tell the honourable member I didn't eat his chocolate chip muffin; it would have driven up my sugar that day and I was trying to keep my sugar down for the campaign. Also in there, I look at Bob Beaton, my next-door neighbour, who just shortly after the election had a mild heart attack and who came here to Halifax and had a stent put in. Bob is recuperating now. I saw him on the weekend putting up his Christmas lights - guys like Bob, walking with you every day and doing those things - talking and that. I also had lots of young people, Mallory Axworthy and Steven Campbell; that little Steven Campbell is in Grade 12 at Sydney Academy High School.</p>
<p>That was another thing about the election, it was the biggest debate outside the Leaders' debate that we had at Centre 200. CBC had put on a debate at Centre 200 and I think there were over 300 people who showed up at that debate between the three candidates. The honourable member for Northside-Westmount was there; the former member for Cape Breton South was there, there were all kinds of members there. It was a big crowd. Someone said it was almost as good as the Leaders' debate on that night. It was moderated by the then host for Information Morning, Steve Sutherland - great job debating that.</p>
<p>Again, it was a very civil debate. I must say that through the whole campaign, everything that was done there was very pleasant, civil. It was a pleasure to go out there and knock on doors and listen to people's views. It's a pleasure when you're running in a campaign knowing that your candidates are above-board, honest, and trustworthy, and I can honestly say that of all three people who ran in that campaign in Sydney-Whitney Pier.</p>
<p>Young Steven Campbell, again, a high school student involved - a great person. I thought that he learned a lot in Grade 12. He is in the political science class at Sydney Academy with Anita Kumar. There were some college students who were involved, a young lad by the name of Brandon Ells. I think Brandon actually went campaigning in my campaign and also campaigned with the member for Glace Bay in that campaign. He's one of Tom Urbaniak's students at CBU and I remember someone in the campaign said, this guy is out canvassing for you and out canvassing for the Liberal candidate. I said, you know the young fellow is just trying to find his way. He's trying to find his way in life and his professor, Tom Urbaniak, had looked at him to get involved in a campaign, so why not canvass with myself, and canvass with the honourable member for Glace Bay to get a different view. I respect young people in university going out and not putting all their eggs in one basket, getting out to see what everybody's points of view are. That's what makes a good society - when we have people like that, who do things like that.</p>
<p>There were lots of family members involved. My brother Harold took time out of his busy Texas hold 'em schedule to work on my campaign as my official agent. Who better to have than the guy with numbers like that? The guy has been to ESPN World's three times, been to the Canadian championship three times. When your brother has that kind of gift with numbers, it is good to have him as your official agent. My brother Bill is another guy who took some time out of his busy schedule at betting on the ponies to help his brother out. I'm kind of fortunate I didn't get that bug on gambling so it was good that my brothers were there. I had lots of fun. A campaign should be fun; it really should be fun when you're out there campaigning, you should have fun.</p>
<p>I had lots of laughs every day, took a couple of spills. I remember falling over one step about six feet and near broke my neck, but I got back up and dusted myself off. I think it was Kelly Lockton that was with me that day and said, are you okay? I said, that's just a part of canvassing. It's either you get bit by a dog or fall over a step. Some of the times you have the funniest moments in life when you're canvassing. I remember back early when I first ran, I think my young lad was seven years old, and I was knocking on doors and he was just hounding me to death that he wanted to go canvassing with me. And that he did and I was knocking on a door and I turned around and the woman was giving me this awful look and I wondered - what have I done? I said I just wanted to see if you would support me and here was my seven-year-old peeing on her hedges. I always wondered if I ever got her vote, thinking about that time when he had done that. I'll never be sure if I did or not, but campaigns are supposed to be fun.</p>
<p>I think of all the guys who went walking with me, I think most of them are probably wearing hearing aids now after canvassing with me, after having being deaf in one ear. I said to Todd Smith and John Maruschak - now there's a good guy. He was my ball coach when I was a kid, but still stood around. He's old enough to be retired from Devco and is a great guy - still involved in the CNIB curling team, he coaches them. John was a great fellow, he was great to walk with, and Todd Smith. You know, one of the better guys who came with me every day was a guy by the name of Wayne Hardy. It was just great to talk to Wayne and walk every day. I made it a policy over the last five elections that I ran in that I always had somebody with me. I would never suggest that anybody canvass alone - it's always good to have somebody there, you never know what can happen.</p>
<p>But having these guys like Todd Smith - Joey Jacobs was another guy. I had Joey on the campaign right up until October 1<sup>st</sup>, until duck season started. Joey was working with me every day on the campaign, but as soon as the duck season started I never saw Joey. He was out hunting ducks all day and I lost Joe. We had a lot of fun talking about that and different species - I don't shoot animals, I photograph animals, but we had lots of fun talking about it.</p>
<p>Joe sent me an e-mail when he was out duck hunting and he said that he saw an all-white, large bird like a Great Blue Heron on Dominion Beach, out at Number 9 Dam in Glace Bay. He wanted to know what it was, so he sent me a picture. I said, Joey, that's what they call a Great Egret. It was a large white bird, the same as a Blue Heron but it's called a Great Egret - two different species, the Snowy Egret and the Great Egret. I told Joe that and said for heaven's sake, Joe, don't shoot that Great Egret. Shoot all the ducks you want, Joe, I know that you love duck hunting.</p>
<p>Bernie Jessome is another guy who canvassed with me. Bernie is a retired insurance salesman. Bernie has been canvassing with me since 1999, a great guy to have with you because he knows everybody in all of the riding. You wouldn't get a better guy than Bernie Jessome. Recently Bernie was at my little Christmas function on Sunday - it was great to see him. There's nobody better - he was the treasurer for my riding association.</p>
<p>Bernie Mason, Regina Mason, great people. I don't know if you remember the story that their son had a stroke in Japan and was in Japan and had no family or anything and they had to airlift him back to Canada from Japan; the young lad now is doing fine. I'll tell the Legislature that after being medically lifted back to Canada and back to Cape Breton, he is now in the NSCC, Marconi Campus, in school and doing fine. He is hanging in there, God bless him. I think the world of him. I mean we think that we're all handed different things in life but to overcome that, that devastation of having a stroke and being in a foreign country with those types of medical problems, to come back and go to school and to see him at NSCC - we should be very proud of a young lad like that who lives in our community.</p>
<p>Bradley Ross and Debbie Ross - good people. Many people would know, like the honourable member for Northside-Westmount, Brad is the coach of the Sydney Boxing Club, and his wife Debbie, put on many boxing cards over the last four or five years. Brad just fought two years ago - I think this is his last fight, he says that according to Debbie it's his last fight down in the United States where he won the middleweight championship. It was great to see Brad and Debbie out helping, doing those things that are important for you in the campaign.</p>
<p>Susan Christie, another lady who is - actually there's another good story. Susan Christie was 39 years of age, went back to school, the mother of three children - Shara, Amanda, and the young lad Tyler - went back to school and became a nurse. She graduated as a nurse at the age of 40 years old - went back to school with three children and now she works at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in the infants' ward, in pediatrics. So there's a good story - you're never too late to go back to school.</p>
<p>I always told Susan that I was 35 years of age when I went back to school, to Holland College, to become a youth worker. I went to the school (Interruption) Somebody said, where did you graduate? I said HK, and they said, what school is that? I said "hard knocks" to somebody.</p>
<p>Kenny Long was another guy who showed up every day, and I think of my good friend Russell Fitzgerald who came canvassing with me. Actually Russell is probably the longest-serving employee at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. I remember when we graduated from high school we had this debate - I'm going to the steel plant; he's going to the hospital. This year he celebrates his 40<sup>th</sup> year working at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital - I don't know how the people up there ever put up with him for all those years, I really don't. Russell is a great guy. He has been a friend all my life and played ball and hockey.</p>
<p>Another good friend, Larry Hawranik, Larry showed up every day in the jeep. Larry has a young lad who's autistic, William. Bill is in junior high this year, young Bill, named after his grandfather, a World War II veteran, Bill Hawranik. It was a pleasure to have Larry with me every day, you know, to do all those things.</p>
<p>Kelly Lockton was just a pleasure. I think Kelly's niece works in the Protocol Office, Mallory, she's been there for a number of years now. That's Kelly's niece. She may be off on pregnancy leave, or parental leave now as we call it I guess. Another lady who has been with me from day one is Alice Swan and her husband, John Swan. John worked at the Marine Atlantic. He retired recently. John has been diagnosed with cancer and has been receiving treatment for that and we all wish him the best. Alice is just a sweetheart. John showed up on my campaign but Alice was there each and every day. You could count on her to do the things that were asked of her and John.</p>
<p>Old-time New Democrats like Heather Patterson who was the former EA for the then MP Peter Mancini from 1997 to 2000. Heather is a school teacher at the adult school in Sydney. Heather is just a great person. It was great to have her there. My good friend from high school, Janet Bickerton, Janet is a Public Health nurse now. We hear her sometimes on CBC. I remember doing a study with Janet back when I was the executive director of the Whitney Pier Youth Club. It was a sexuality program for teenagers using a mental health approach and could have found that on the Web site in Ottawa. Janet was there from the day that I built that youth centre, when I had nothing, I had a rat-infested old building that I took and made into probably one of the best youth centres in the Province of Nova Scotia to this day.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Chester Borden is now the executive director of the Whitney Pier Youth Club. Chester was probably the first African Nova Scotian MVP in the Nova Scotia senior ball league back in the day. Chester was a great shortstop, good glove hands and was on the Canada Games team, a great ball player. I think that my colleague, the member for Northside-Westmount, played with Chester back in the day. A great guy to have running the youth centre. I'll talk about the youth centre again along the lines of some of that.</p>
<p>Well, here's a lady I'll talk about, Suzanne MacNeil was another lady who came with me. I think Suzanne is on the Cape Breton Federation of Labour and the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour. I think I drove that poor young girl insane with some of the foolishness. As a matter of fact, I wore her out. I was wondering why she was taking all the Advil afterwards. I wore her out but she said since the campaign was over and she had her hearing checked, she seems to be getting a little better from all the talk going on there.</p>
<p>Joanna Farrell was another person from up on Fisher Street. Greg Thomas, a cab driver, works in Alberta. Greg's brother is the president of the Operating Engineers in Alberta. He has been there for a long time. Kevin Thomas; Kenny Long, a driver; Elsie Deleski whom you will know recently I read a resolution last week about her husband, Don Deleski, where the Government of Nova Scotia and the Sydney Tar Ponds Agency just renamed the bicycle park there for her husband, Don, and her brother-in-law Ron. So it's now called Don and Ron Deleski Bicycle Park which is an honour for that. I actually received a picture, I think I have it in my office now, of Don Deleski and Ron with a 45-gallon drum shovelling the tar pond sludge into that, and I can't repeat the phrase that Don used that day in public, but he made sure he got his point across and got them started on the cleanup of that, you know.</p>
<p>Mary Sheppard, who recently just lost her husband, Earl, who was a World War II veteran, volunteered for years at the Whitney Pier Legion. Harold MacDonald, my brother, I mentioned. Kelly Brown O'Rourke each and every day was on the canvassing phone team. She was there each and every day. I think of Bob Dwyer, a good friend of mine who I was just at the hockey with on the weekend, canvassed with me a few nights here and there. Joanne Crezner volunteering in there, coming in. Diane Delaney, a lady who recently lost her husband a few years ago, Pat, two beautiful children, Amanda and Lisa, always worked on every campaign that I ran in. Diane has had many obstacles in her life but never let any of those bother her. She has risen above and beyond. Now she has the love of her life, her grandchild, with her on the weekend and I think that keeps her happy.</p>
<p>Old-time New Democrats like Nina Kirby in there each and every day, working on raising money for the campaign. Brenda Steele was somebody who wasn't in my riding but showed up each and every day to work the phones.</p>
<p>It was important to work the phones because in Cape Breton and all the campaigns that I run, I don't use a call centre. I have all volunteers and people who are there. I've never let a call centre call into my riding during a campaign. It's strictly all volunteer, all campaign members who help out. Never decided to ever go that way. Brenda Steele was there each and every time.</p>
<p>Probably two of the best canvassers during the campaign were Carter and Paulette Hayes. I'll tell you, some day that guy should be a politician, because if anybody could talk people into voting for you, that Carter could do that. I'll tell you, he was a great canvasser, a great friend, I was glad to have him with me and it was an honour and a privilege. Paulette, whose dad died about three days after the campaign - my condolences to her and her family and her mother.</p>
<p>Then again, signs are an important part of an election. It's probably my pet peeve, signs in an election. I'd like to someday run an election where we never had to have a sign because it becomes quite a competition. (Applause) My pet peeve is signs, I say give each member who is running in the election 10 signs and put them on the 10 busiest intersections in the riding and that's it because you get into this sign war and it's such a costly event. I think they were like $4 or $5 a sign.</p>
<p>I had a new riding that expanded from 12,000 to 18,000, I had 6,000 more voters. In the first six days of the campaign I ran out of signs, and then we had to order 400 more, so it's a cost. I think that maybe someday we could use that, but if we did that, I guess a fellow like me would have to step aside. Because without signs, you would have to use social media, whether it be Facebook or Twitter, those things that I'm not accustomed to - although my 19-year-old could tell you when you get all these abbreviated, LOL and you've got to ask your wife what does that mean, laugh out loud, you know. So you've got all these things.</p>
<p>I'd love to someday not have signs in an election. I remember when I was EPC and the sign chair for Sydney-Victoria back in the 1990s and I remember the brain child in Ottawa at that time decided to come up with two-sided signs. I remember working for six weeks trying to put them together. I had to buy two-by-fours, split them, cut them to one-third, bang - I'll never forget that. Without that sign crew, the Bob Barringtons and the Tom Jones, each and every day doing that, Tony DiFlavio, Derrick Legg, Kenny Evans, people like that who went out and did those things for you, they're an important part of a campaign.</p>
<p>Again I say today I would like to thank - and if I've forgotten anybody - I may say my mother Enid, she is listening today. For those of you who don't know, she's blind but she sure can hear me, I'll tell you that. Her senses are pretty good. I don't know if she knows I'm speaking today, but no doubt somebody will tell her in the seniors' because they know everything that goes on in the seniors' unit there. They keep an eye on each other.</p>
<p>It's funny, when you talk about seniors and keeping them in their own home or keeping them in seniors' units, I think of the riding of Cape Breton Nova, when we put in 32 seniors' units in what they called Jim Mac Court. These are barrier-free seniors' units with in-floor heating, concrete driveways - probably the best seniors' units I've ever seen in the Province of Nova Scotia. There's such a waiting list to get into those seniors' units. They are for low-income seniors, but the way that the accord worked at that time between the federal government and the provincial government, it was based on Canada Mortgage and Housing income. At that time they decided in the Department of Housing that those would be $650 - heat and lights included in that - which is quite good for seniors, but their income had to be between $19,000 and $24,000 for them to qualify.</p>
<p>That itself up there on Terrace Street in that riding has become its own community. It's its own community within itself; they all look after each other. I was fortunate enough also to have duplexes and single units for low-income single mothers. I thought that in the community of Whitney Pier, we have the highest per capita public housing in the Province of Nova Scotia. So when they decided back - and I remember meeting with the former government and the former minister and I talked about ghettoization of public units and I thought about the slang names of the "chicken coops", they called them, and how the kids that I grew up with and the kids in my neighbourhood were ghettoized because all the units were put together. They had 104 units in one neighbourhood and 104 in the other. When we had an opportunity this time - and I had an opportunity to speak with the former minister from the Progressive Conservative Government to talk about a strategy around housing, we decided we would look at building these units in neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This is what we did in the community of Whitney Pier, so I look at the Minister of Community Services, if she would look at the way these units were built. They are recipients of housing units paid for by the Province of Nova Scotia under the Community Services Department of Housing. What we did this time was took those housing units and put them in neighbourhoods and they're all occupied by single mothers, but they are occupied by single mothers who are working. That was the strategy here. They are single mothers in those units in that housing who are actually working - so it's a beautiful part.</p>
<p>To talk about going on to the different parts of the new riding, Cape Breton Nova no longer exists - my salute to Cape Breton Nova. As the newly-elected member for Sydney-Whitney Pier, I'm honoured and privileged to be here to represent those people. I think with expansion, the riding has now gone to 18,000-some voters. The first thing I did, as I was chairman of the House of Assembly Management Commission, back in August when we had a meeting to make sure that we would have barrier-free offices for all MLAs elected and barrier-free offices for MLAs who were elected, as chairman of that committee, I knew the debate. I remember the James McGregor Stewart Society was advocating on behalf of wheelchair accessible offices for MLAs.</p>
<p>The first time I met that committee was April 22, 2013. I met a gentleman by the name of Kevin - whom you would all know - a gentleman by the name of Gus and a lady by the name of Kelly. I met them on April 22, 2013 and it was a pleasure to meet with them. It wasn't until I had actually an eye-opener to talk about not only barrier-free offices, but it was about employing somebody with a disability who was in a wheelchair. Now - you couldn't do that, Gordie, because your office isn't barrier-free. I would like to report to the Legislature today that I made it a point, after the election - and I was fortunate enough to come back - that I now am in a barrier-free office as of November 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>I didn't want to wait the three years. I said I'll lead by example. I understood the issues as I have a son who had many, many issues, and one of them is not being in a wheelchair, but lately he has been in and out of a wheelchair with some of his epileptic problems and I realized that, you know what, I'm going to set an example here. I am going to move.</p>
<p>I am now in a new, barrier-free office at 731 Victoria Road. If anybody wants to come down to the multicultural community of Whitney Pier, they are more than welcome. The bathroom is barrier-free as well. I think it was important as the chairman of the House of Assembly Management Commission and the former Speaker, that I lead by example, to make sure that we include these people not only in our offices but in our daily lives.</p>
<p>I remember a year ago I spent a day in a wheelchair and used the Handi Trans system. I, myself, as a human being didn't realize that, so I would ask all members of the Legislature if they would like to spend a day in a wheelchair one day, actually go in a wheelchair like I did and try to navigate the sidewalks, try to navigate the buildings and then you will realize. You wonder what people - I always thought when people got older they could go to the Department of Community Services Housing Division to get a grant for a wheelchair ramp. I always had this idea and I always thought - the federal government's DVA has wheelchair ramps made out of aluminum and metal so if that person's life expectancy is a couple of years, instead of building a very expensive wheelchair ramp on the home, if we had a mobile wheelchair ramp, when that person unfortunately passed away that ramp could go on to somebody else - to recycle that ramp each and every time so there wouldn't be such a waiting list for wheelchair ramps.</p>
<p>The new riding now includes the area of Membertou First Nation. I canvassed in the area of Membertou during the election. That reserve is named after the Grand Chief Membertou from 1510 to 1611. The community of Membertou belongs to the greater tribal group of Mi'kmaq Nation. Membertou is situated three kilometres from the heart of the City of Sydney, Nova Scotia, within its tribal district of Unama'ki. It is one of the five Mi'kmaq communities in Cape Breton and one of 13 in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Membertou is an urban First Nation community consisting of over 1,260 people and one of five communities that make up Cape Breton Regional Municipality, with a total population of over 115,000 in Cape Breton Regional Municipality. Membertou was not always situated at its present location. Many years ago Membertou, formally known as the Kings Road Reserve, was located just off Kings Road along the Sydney Harbour. In 1916 the Exchequer Court of Canada ordered the relocation of 125 Mi'kmaq, the first time an Aboriginal community had been legally forced through the courts to relocate in Canadian history. In 1926, the Mi'kmaq Membertou community was officially moved to its present-day location.</p>
<p>Membertou operates under the Indian Act of Canada, federal legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada. It is governed by one chief and 12 councillors that are elected every two years by the Membertou community members. Chief Terrance Paul, a good friend of mine, has been elected chief of Membertou, I think it's 29 years now he has been the chief of Membertou - 29 consecutive years, a long time to be in politics and a long time to be in any type of politics.</p>
<p>Membertou Chief Terry Paul has had that position since 1984, a long time to be in public life for the chief, but it is one of the most open and efficient Native communities in the country. Hard to believe it's one of the most efficient Native communities in the Country of Canada. Chief Paul has served on many boards and is one of the original founders of the National Capital Corporation. Where do you have a reserve in Canada that's ISO-rated? Membertou is something that all Mi'kmaq should be proud of from all over the country.</p>
<p>Their councillors work hard. Some of the people who helped me in the campaign - Alex Paul, Alex works in the education field for the Membertou. Jeff Ward, Jeff is not originally from Membertou, Jeff comes from a band up in Red Bank, in the Miramichi. Red Bank is located just on the other side of Sunny Corner. Beautiful place to go fishing; I have a camp up there so I know all about that beautiful fishing territory in the Miramichi - happened to marry a girl from up there so I'm well aware of Jeff Ward who helped out in the campaign.</p>
<p>Bill Bonnar of Membertou, Terry Paul, Alex - those 12 councillors in Membertou and their chief - you know, it's a success story, the story of Membertou. In 1995 the Membertou band had 37 employees, it was operating on a $4 million budget while dealing with a $1 million annual operating deficit in Membertou. The community was poor with low morale and high unemployment rates. It was then that Chief Terry Paul decided it was time for a major change.</p>
<p>With great determination he and council recruited band members who had left the reserve prior to pursuing their education and were employed throughout the country by various companies such as Lang Michener Barrister and Solicitors, the Union of Nova Scotia Indians, and other corporate and government organizations. Terry knew he could bring these young, well-educated people back to Membertou, so what he did is the newly formed leadership decided an unprecedented approach for Membertou would be needed.</p>
<p>While the task required sacrifice, it also generated a renewed sense of accomplishment and discipline for the band. They quickly earned the respect of external parties in government and industry. With its financial house in order and vastly improved capacity in management and administration, Membertou is now positioned to play a greater part in the mainstream economy.</p>
<p>With a goal of generating new revenue streams to diminish dependence on government transfers, Membertou made three strategic decisions - the first was to actively forge a new economic frontier, one that built on the innovations of today while at the same time incorporated indigenous knowledge-based principles of conservation, sustainability of resources, and reverence for the land and the waters where we live.</p>
<p>With the principles of conservation, sustainability and innovation and success firmly in place, Membertou then strategically increased its profile with major private sector companies by launching the Membertou Corporate Office in downtown Halifax. This provided lucrative partnerships with private industry sectors in oil and gas, engineering, mining, GIS, IT, aerospace, business management and consulting services.</p>
<p>The third strategic decision was to initiate proactive education and career-related training programs for residents of Membertou in order to maximize employment opportunities that arose as a result of the newly forged business partnerships and initiatives. The present and future development opportunities flowing from these strategic decisions continue to build momentum for Membertou's aspirations of financial independence and self-determination.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 past years, I'm proud to say, Membertou's budget has gone from $4 million to a current $65 million operating budget. The number of employees has jumped from 37 to 531 to this day. There are many new internal departments and businesses such as Membertou Market, Membertou Advanced Solutions, Membertou Mapping Service, Membertou Quality Management Services and, most recently, the prestigious Membertou Trade and Convention Centre.</p>
<p>Now if that's not a success story for Nova Scotia and all of Canada - we all can learn from the success of Membertou and what they've done, from being removed from a piece of land where there was traditional hunting and fishing on Kings Road to this piece of land, in almost 100 years, the success is known all over Canada for Membertou and what they have done for their people and their community.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think other Band Councils around the Province of Nova Scotia, the 13 that are here, could learn very much from Membertou and what they do. We graduate more Mi'kmaq at the University College of Cape Breton than anywhere else in the country. Our Mi'kmaq are very well educated, along with keeping their traditional sense of the land and the water and what they stand for.</p>
<p>That's just the new part of my riding, which I'm very fortunate to represent. Off Membertou is Alexandra Street, Brown Street, Albion Street, Topshee Drive - my good friends Scott Black and Milt MacDonald live on Alexandra Street, good people who come out for me in the campaign because I was never their MLA before, I never represented that part of the riding so you can understand. I think the way the riding broke down was 51 per cent of the riding was Cape Breton Nova and 49 per cent of the riding was Cape Breton South, which was represented - I'll say his name now that he has retired, I know that you don't say somebody's name in the Legislature - the Honourable Manning MacDonald, who represented the riding of Cape Breton South from 1993 until his retirement in 2013.</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald represented his riding, a man proud of his riding which was very loyal to Manning over the years. That riding was a Liberal riding from 1974 to 1993, which was held by a former Speaker, Mr. Vincent MacLean. He was a former Leader of the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia from 1974 to 1993. All told, the riding of Cape Breton South was a Liberal riding for 39 consecutive years. So, Madam Speaker, you can understand the challenge I had. I think on election night, as soon as you turned the television on, it said riding to watch - Sydney-Whitney Pier - riding to watch - Global, CBC; I don't know who else - the Cape Breton Post, the Halifax ChronicleHerald, all of those - the riding to watch, Sydney-Whitney Pier.</p>
<p>I said maybe they knew something that I didn't. I guess because it was a new riding, had a young Liberal candidate. Maybe it's because they brought Justin Trudeau into the Pier Legion, maybe that was the factor they were saying. They brought Justin Trudeau into the Pier Legion. I kind of said, well you know, Justin Trudeau in the Pier.</p>
<p>We had Tommy Douglas there back in December 1982. I was a young lad when I went to listen to Tommy Douglas at the Ukrainian Hall in December 1982. So I'm bringing Tommy Douglas, Justin Trudeau. I remember saying Jeez, and all these billboards popped up and there was a picture of the young candidate, the now Premier, and Justin Trudeau. In my old ballfield where I played all my life there's this big poster and there's another one - I don't know, thousands of dollars to put these billboards up. So then you had Justin Trudeau in Whitney Pier; you had the former MLA for 19 years, Manning MacDonald; you had the now-Premier four times into the riding giving out pop and chips at Ashby Corner. There were pop and chips that I think were left over from the barbeque they had at the Pier that they didn't get rid of, so they were going to give them to people during the campaign on Ashby Corner. I mean, you think about that now, so some of my friends said, you ran against Justin Trudeau, the honourable Premier, the former member Manning MacDonald, and Derek Mombourquette. That was quite an accomplishment, to think you ran against all four of them.</p>
<p>Like I said, Justin Trudeau seemed like a nice young lad in the Pier, but he should have come back on October 8<sup>th</sup> and come to the Pier Legion. That's when we had a hoedown at that Legion that night, and I extended him an offer to come back on October 8<sup>th</sup>. We could have had a real good party with him that night. The crew that was there that night would have really wanted to party with him.</p>
<p>I remember CBC saying the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia won every riding that Justin Trudeau was in and visited - they won every riding. I said, Jeez, that's strange, I thought he was in Whitney Pier at the Pier Legion. He was, I know he was. You can bring in all the resources you can to a campaign, but I thought, if you work hard &#x2026;</p></speech>

KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, last year on April 11, 2012, the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development stood in this House and talked about the school review process and she said, "The school review process is a very clearly articulated process where parents and community have the opportunity on two separate occasions to offer their input to the process and to the board." I will table that.</p>
<p>Last week, when speaking of the very same process, the very same minister said the process was "adversarial and heartbreaking." and I will table that. So my question to the minister is - here is a complete contradiction - will the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development tell members of this House when she had that change of heart, when she had the recent flip-flop, and when this all came to light?</p></speech>

<p>The Minister of Education and Early Childhood Learning spent nearly $1 million on ads and promotions while wait-lists for accessing speech-language pathology and school psychology were growing. It is the same minister who slashed funding to school boards and offered no additional supports to cover increasing costs, and then turns around and asks them to halt their decisions.

KEITH BAIN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development had a chance to reassure parents that they will continue to have a choice in what kind of child care they want for their children. When she had a chance to be clear she waffled; when given an opportunity to bring clarity to the confusion her predecessor created on the file, she ducked; and yesterday during estimates the minister muddied the water further by saying that Nova Scotians are seeing the beginning of a big shift.</p>
<p>My question through you to the minister is, will the minister be clear today and tell parents and small-business owners what this government's plans are for child care?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this was a very important day for Nova Scotians because this is the day that we were able to discuss how we are going to be shifting, philosophically, how we take care of our youngest citizens. So today we announced that we are going to be providing an integrated service model in the department, working collaboratively along with our stakeholders in that process, and our advisory committee. I want to say that as we move forward we are going to be setting up some initial sites, but while this is happening, it will be business as usual in the Province of Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p>

In December 2011 the minister who used to be responsible for child care attended a press conference with CUPE where she said her department has begun discussing phasing out public funding for private operators. The minister said, "It takes a long time to change a system, but I think there's a great appreciation in government that something needs to be done."</p>
<p>I will table that, Mr. Speaker, so my question through you to the minister is, will the minister tell us today if the former minister was incorrect when she said that the NDP was bringing socialized daycare to Nova Scotia?</p></speech>

We need to make sure that from birth until our children enter school, and throughout the system, we provide every opportunity for them to be successful.</p>
<p>The announcement today is providing an opportunity for Nova Scotians. There is going to be a shift with the integration of our services. We have created a new department under one roof. We will be able to serve the needs of our children, as I said, from Primary forward. There is no change in delivery of service in the Province of Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p></speech>

BAIN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, back in February, two months ago, the Deputy Minister of Community Services appeared at the Standing Committee on Community Services. What he said was exactly opposite to what the minister said at the CUPE news conference. He said, "There is no planning around, in fact, actually moving away from our existing model." I'll table that.</p>
<p>Today the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development told reporters that child care funding is under review. So my question through you to the minister is, who is right and who got it wrong? Is there an NDP plan to change the funding model for child care or isn't there?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Last year the federal government expected revenues to grow by 6 per cent. However, they have now had to downgrade their revenue growth projections to 3.8 per cent. In short, the federal government has had to adjust its tax base estimates downward, and with that the feds are expecting lower revenue growth. This realistic adjustment is in stark contrast to what the Finance Minister is telling Nova Scotians today about our revenue projections.</p>
<p>My question is, with the province expecting to lose 1,100 jobs in the next year and clear indications of a slowing economy, where is the Finance Minister finding an extra $145 million in new personal tax revenues?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, private-sector economists at all of the major financial institutions review Nova Scotia's budget economic assumptions, and they compare them against their own forecasts. In addition to that, the Conference Board of Canada, APEC economists, and economists here in the universities all look at the economic assumptions of the department, and having done that, they concur with the assumptions of the department, and that formulates the estimates, the fiscal forecast, of our budget - a balanced budget - a balanced budget that restores really important services like the children's dental program that were cut by the Liberals in the 1990s.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, standing behind assumptions and so on is flying in the face of a lot of the facts that I'm bringing today. Where's forecasting in the budget for a 0.2 per cent decline in employment next year? Just as important to note, the labour income growth last year was slower than it was even during the recession, and because of downgraded GDP growth, the federal government is expecting revenues to be a full $17 billion lower than were predicted in the Fall. All of these are facts. We, too, are facing a slowing economy and nominal GDP is only expected to grow 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 3 per cent in 2014. With all of these facts affecting the tax base, it is very difficult for us to understand how the Finance Minister can provide a lot of bafflegab about how she's going to achieve this overly-estimated revenue future.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, will the Minister of Finance tell Nova Scotians how provincial income tax revenue can be expected to grow at a whopping rate of 7 per cent in the medium term, when nominal GDP growth rates are forecast to be only 2.3 and 3 per cent, respectively?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, all of the economists in the big financial institutions in the country looked at the assumptions that were put together by the economists in the Department of Finance, and they compared those assumptions with their own forecasts, and they find the assumptions to be reasonable. In fact, they found the assumptions in the Department of Finance to be conservative compared to their forecasts for the coming year.</p>
<p>Many economists in this country are looking at Nova Scotia's economy in the coming year and out into the next year, as being growth in the middle of the Canadian provinces for the first time in many, many years, Mr. Speaker. This is the result of a number of very positive projects that are on the horizon. This province is turning the corner, with the shipbuilding contract, with the building of the Nova Centre, with the investment in IT by IBM. There are many positive job opportunities for Nova Scotians that will contribute to the GDP growth of this province, good jobs and good taxes that we can reinvest in programs for kids, seniors, and small business.</p></speech>

LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, according to a freedom of information request received in our office last month, more than 3,000 Nova Scotians - 3,132, to be exact - are waiting for hip and knee replacements in our province. Of these 3,000-plus patients, over half of them, 55 per cent of them, have been waiting more than the national benchmark of six months. In fact, a national report card produced last summer by the Canadian Wait Time Alliance gave Nova Scotia an F for our effort in knees, a D for hip replacement, and foot and ankle, of course, is off the charts, some of the worst grades in the country.</p>

<p>We know we need to work on the wait times for orthopaedic surgeries. That's why I'm proud that we just recently announced an additional $2 million to increase the number of orthopaedic surgeries that we could do over a weekend, to really address those individuals who have been waiting over a year.</p>
<p>We're going to continue to work in that fashion, to ensure that Nova Scotians get access to the surgeries they need.</p></speech>

We have 1,700-plus patients waiting longer than six months, another 500 who have been waiting longer than one year.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the question. The Target 100 program is a very important program. I believe that we're well up in the high - around 48, 50 in the numbers. It is a program that is different than others because it is being run by the co-operative, plus the other factor is that it's a higher level of employment for individuals coming off income assistance. It often puts them like in an assistant management position. It has been a program that has been working well for those who are involved. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned the first time, the fact is that the program is actually being run by the co-operative and we support the co-operative through the clientele that we feel have the ability and the education or initiative that they want to go forward with this. So if there's an agreement with the clientele that they want to be involved in this program, we support them from that angle. Then the co-operative supports them in finding the work and ensuring that they have the monitoring and support to make it successful for them. Thank you.</p>

We're looking at it in a variety of different areas, including the employability of individuals, and we're working with LAE also, so we are doing things very differently. We're doing them in a holistic manner, bringing departments together and providing opportunities that neither Party ever thought of looking at when they were in government.</p>

LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I don't like to go back too far in political history because Nova Scotians don't want us to go back to when we were in power in 1999. They are going to judge this government on its ineffectiveness for the past four years. (Applause) But just for the record, the last time the Liberals were in government, the orthopaedic wait time was four months.</p>
<p>My question, again, is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Late last month Nova Scotia lost a bright young orthopaedic surgeon. Dr. Andrea Veljkovic went to Toronto. Having been in the Valley for two years, her wait-list grew to 1,300 patients. There are not too many specialists like Dr. Veljkovic out there. In addition to ortho procedures she specialized in minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery for people with diabetes, a demand which will only grow in this province, not diminish. She was young, bright and innovative, apparently just too bright and innovative for this NDP Government. With wait-lists exceeding 3,000 patients, with her own patient load of 1,300, how could the minister afford to let Dr. Veljkovic go?</p></speech>

Back in the 1990s, Nova Scotians will remember and health care workers will remember, and they can pretend it didn't happen but it happened. We're going to continue to invest in Nova Scotia. We have the first physician resource plan in the province's history. The Liberals didn't bring one in; the Progressive Conservatives never brought one in. We need to ensure that we have the right mix of physicians in this province so that we can improve services for all Nova Scotians. We're going to continue to work to ensure that Nova Scotians have access to the right doctors that they need and we're going to continue to work with all district health authorities to ensure that people have access to the surgeries they need.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is hearing the alarm bells going that the physician resource plan doesn't quite monitor the true clinical footprint of this province. This is a surgeon who wanted to stay. The district asked the department for the financial resources to keep her and the answer from the NDP Government was no - so much for autonomous local decision by DHAs. We have an NDP Government that can find over $1 million for self-promoting TV ads, yet no money to keep an orthopedic surgeon here in the province.

<p>The member opposite actually was the minister in charge of the department similar to this department. I'm going to give him a little history lesson. I think it was the Regan Government - I could be wrong - but anyway, at one point in the past a previous government really took over the funding for education. Prior to that, education funding was done at the local level. The government took over that funding to the level of 85 per cent of the costs, and now municipalities are responsible for about 15 per cent.</p>
<p>When the member keeps saying this is a provincial jurisdiction, what the province actually did was remove 85 per cent of that education cost from local government, and they're left with 15 per cent, which I think turned out to be a good thing for municipalities.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#81ace0ab-54e7-4b6d-8d48-6d416fbcd939"><from>MR. GOSSE</from><p>Not a problem. Can I finish now? Thank you.</p>
<p>So you wake up each and every day as a human being and you try to learn from your mistakes, and you try to learn from things that you did. There are no heroes in politics, there never are, and when I die there will be no "honourable" written on my headstone. I'm just an ordinary human being who's trying to do the best he can for people that he represents. I think the people that made that judgment about me and put me back here again, they've made that decision to come back here, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>You talk about the riding - and I'll try to finish the riding, try to finish what I was talking about, saying that in politics, sometimes you overcome obstacles that are greater than you. That's what you do. It's not up to you. The people of the Province of Nova Scotia own each and every seat in this Legislature. They'll determine who sits in this seat. They'll determine it - not anybody else, the people. When they have an election like they did on October 8<sup>th</sup>, they decided where you'll sit in here.</p>
<p>I've sat in every chair in this Legislature - Opposition, government, that chair, and this chair. I know what it's like. There is not another chair that I can sit in in here. I know what it's like to get in here. I know what it's like to do your job, to get up and represent the constituents that you represent. There is not another chair, there is not a taste of anything in government I haven't had, and I will continue to learn each and every day, as I get out of bed, what life is all about.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the north end of Sydney, the Holy Angels High School - I remember before the campaign I visited that Holy Angels High School. Actually, I think I took the former Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism there; the former Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage; the former Premier there, because I thought it was a worthwhile endeavour for Holy Angels to be purchased by New Dawn. They have some great ideas there whether it be IT, whether it be an English preparation program, or whether low-income housing units go in there.</p>
<p>I think it was important for the new part of the riding in the north end of Sydney. I think the former government gave them $80,000 along with $20,000 from the Cape Breton Regional Municipality to come up with a feasibility study to look at best uses for the former Holy Angels High School to see what was best for them, to see what they can use to best describe the use for that facility, a long tradition of a girls school but now we're going to move forward and look at that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the opening of the Open Hearth Park - it was a pleasure to be there to see that. I actually marched on that day with all my former colleagues and steelworkers, guys that I haven't seen - I put on my helmet and my heat clothes for the first time in over 23 years, and it was an honour. I remember they were saying, well, what's the difference between being in the Legislature and being on top of the coke ovens batteries, you know, wearing wooden shoes and a jackhammer in 2,100 degrees? There was no difference.</p>
<p>I always said that what I missed the most about Sydney Steel and being a former steelworker was the camaraderie among men, the places that you worked in from the blast furnace to the open-hearth of the blooming mill pits, to the rail mill, to the coke oven batteries. To see the transformation of that property to what it is today is just amazing. I know there are people out there who are probably still skeptical about the technology that was used to solidify and stabilize that.</p>
<p>The very first football game was played there recently where the Sydney Academy High School Wildcats played their first inaugural football game. There had to be upwards of almost 1,000 people at that football game with an artificial turf football field lighted for the kids in our community. Now with the Open Hearth Park being completed, we have a peewee, an atom peewee, bantam and now a high school football league.</p>
<p>So for many, many years now we'll be able to make sure that that place is used. We have a bicycle park. If you drive by the Open Hearth Park nowadays - and as a young man who went down there through No. 5 Gate as a kid and remembers the open hearth, the blast furnace, the blooming mills, all the different parts and it's all gone. They have a soccer field. It's used so much when you go by at night. There's a basketball court. There's a tennis court lit up until 11 o'clock at night; a soccer field, natural, and the football field used for both.</p>
<p>A piece of land has now been given by the government to Horizon Achievement Centre. Horizon Achievement Centre would be somewhat like the Prescott Group that's here in Halifax. Horizon Achievement Centre is a program where the people with disabilities go to work each and every day and become an important part of our community. There's a piece of land, I think it's about 5.3 acres, set aside for Horizon Achievement Centre to build a new multi-use facility for their clients and it would really enhance that Nova Scotia land and the business park in there. So after losing the Sydney Steel and 4,000 workers we must be able to attract business to Sydney.</p>
<p>Some will argue - is Sydney on the rebound or is it not on the rebound? If you think about it, the new opening of the Old Triangle in Sydney - Danny Ellis has opened the new Old Triangle in downtown Sydney at Charlotte Street. That's a very important part of the downtown core, now, to have that open up. New stores are now coming in. We just opened a new Target on Prince Street, welcoming new stores. Also, Giant Tiger is supposed to be coming sometime in the new year.</p>
<p>I don't know if we are turning the corner in Cape Breton but why are these large box stores now locating in Cape Breton, setting up business there - Target? Now we have competition between Sobeys, President's Choice, Target, Walmart, Giant Tiger. Who benefits from competition but the consumer? The consumer always benefits from competition. By having that competition, I think it will be there.</p>
<p>The other important thing is that for many years we've always had untreated sewer water and untreated water going into Sydney Harbour. Presently, and over the last two years, the Province of Nova Scotia with $5.1 million; the federal government with $5.1 million; and the CBRM with $5.1 million - $15.3 million to take that untreated raw sewage from going into the Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>Right now Phases I, II, and III are underway, so what that meant is the raw sewage coming off of the former radar base site will now be redirected into Battery Point going into the treatment facility. Untreated water and sewage from South Bar, MacLeod Street now that sewer pipe that runs in Ward 6 will be redirected, and the other line coming in along King's Road.</p>
<p>I remember my constituent Tom McCabe, who's a retired major in the military, said that when those are all completed he's willing to go for a swim in that part of the harbour. I said to him, we could never swim there when we were kids with all that untreated raw sewage, but I told Tom he's more than welcome to do that once we get that untreated raw sewage out of there.</p>
<p>That part of the harbour has been closed since 1980. Nobody has been in there, and again, it's an honour and a privilege to come back to this Legislature to speak on behalf of the constituents of the new riding of Sydney-Whitney Pier. Thanks to all my campaign workers, and thank you to my family. The sacrifices of your family because you're away from Monday to Friday - you come home Friday night and you spend some time with your constituents on Saturday doing events, stuff again on Sunday, you see your family, and then drive back either Sunday night or Monday. I think as politicians we should all read the book <i>The Dark Side: the Personal Price of a Political Life</i> by Steve Paikin or <i>The House is not a Home</i> by Eric Nielsen - very good literature for us to live by as politicians.</p>
<p>My time is up, and I will now have my seat.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, from February 2009 to February 2013 the price of energy went up 44.5 per cent. If we compare the four years before that to the price of energy, it only went up 6.5 per cent; then of course the previous government didn't use dirty, imported coal to produce energy. During the four-year comparison, there is a 37.9 per cent difference in percentage increases; that is horrendous. The NDP has inflated the price of energy to the most expensive in the country and the price of their solution is well unknown. Yet small- to medium-size businesses, and everyday Nova Scotians, are left wondering why there are no jobs. Mr. Speaker, the province is not open for business. My question to the Minister of ERDT is will he admit not only have the NDP jobs failed but they have created a perfect storm of economic breakdown?</p>

            <from>HON. PERCY PARIS</from>
            <p>The fact is that we have created a good environment for businesses right across the Province of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotians, for the first time in 20 years, are optimistic about their future, the big projects that we have on the horizon, the Maritime Link, the Nova Centre, the ships project. The fact that we've got PROJEX, the west coming east, IBM building a centre of excellence that could have been anywhere in the world, and they chose Nova Scotia. The horizon has never been brighter in 20 years.</p>

            <from>MR. ORRELL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, if we look at the CPI in general for the last four years and the four years preceding that, the percentage increases are 11.7 and 6.9 per cent respectively. That means that all items with in the CPI have increased by 4.7 per cent more than the four years before the NDP started their reign of terror. This means there is less disposable income for consumers and more expensive conditions for business operators. Shelter increased by an additional 1 per cent from the four years before, clothing 7.7 per cent, goods 9.5 per cent, and transportation 20.6 per cent. These numbers are significant. Now if the NDP had their way, I'm sure they would be hidden along with their $27 million error. My question is, will the minister apologize for making life harder for Nova Scotians and adopt policies that actually grow the economy and create jobs.</p>

            <p>It is indeed a pleasure to rise on my feet and talk about all the opportunities that have been created for Nova Scotians in the last four years. Just very recently, after the good Minister of Finance tabled her budget here in the House, she went to Cape Breton and she addressed the chamber of commerce. As a result of that the chamber was quoted in the Cape Breton Post - bear with me because I'm going to table this - and guess what the chamber of commerce said? This is by Paula Gallagher who is chairwoman of the chamber of commerce, and I quote - this is from Cape Breton Post and it is dated March 28, 2013, "MacDonald said one of the major initiatives in the April 4 budget will be a plan to simplify access to programs for small businesses. She also said the small business tax would be cut half a percentage point to three per cent - the lowest rate in 20 years." And I quote, "The budget reflects the fact that the minister and the government have listened to what matters to the business community." Paula Gallagher, Mr. Speaker.</p>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the minister also told the chamber about lowering the threshold during that budget.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, from February 2009, Nova Scotia's increase in CPI was 10.8 per cent; nationally it was only 7.8 per cent. In the four years prior, Nova Scotia increased by 7.4 per cent and nationally we increased by 7.7 per cent. Remember the days when we had economic statistics that were lower than the national average, but in a good way? Four years is a long time and Nova Scotians are sick of this government's mishandling of our economy. Nova Scotia has the third-lowest percentage increase in weekly wages and almost 2 per cent lower than the national average.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister commit to scrapping the failed NDP economic plan and provide relief for taxpayers who need a break?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you don't have to take my word for it; I want to read another quote for you. This says - and I'm not going to start from the very beginning - referring to this government it says "great changes and approach for making it easier for businesses to get support and connect with the right agencies and services. It will be important to get the word out as this is quite a significant change to how business is done in the province especially how businesses interface with government. We will do what we can to spread the word."</p>

<p>Back in 2007 the municipal council in Clare forwarded a proposal to the Department of Health to ask government to replace the existing long-term care facility of Villa Acadienne, which opened back in 1974 in Meteghan. Villa Acadienne opened around the same time as the Tideview Terrace in Digby, and Tidal View Manor in Yarmouth. These two long-term care facilities have both been replaced in recent years.</p>
<p>My first question to the minister, has his department made a decision yet on replacing the Villa Acadienne?</p></speech>

My commitment to him was, as soon as possible, to get down to see the Villa Acadienne in his area, in his riding, because I've tried to do that on a number of occasions across the province.</p>
<p>I've said in the past that the government is going to continue to be involved in replacement of long-term care facilities; we're going to continue to be involved in renovating existing long-term care facilities, Mr. Speaker. We're going to continue to assess the needs in the community, also with the investment that we are making in long-term care and home care.

          <p>We know the demographic shift and change that we're seeing here in Nova Scotia. That's why, as a government, we need to ensure we change policies. We ensure that services are there for seniors, and long-term care is one of those areas we need to continue to look at investing in, but also ensuring that seniors in our province have options, so they have options if they need to go into a long-term care facility - but more importantly, and from what I've been hearing, and I know many members of my caucus have been hearing from Nova Scotians, especially seniors, is that they want to stay in their homes longer. So we're going to continue to move forward on both fronts, ensuring that long-term care facilities are there in communities across the province, but ensuring that the services like home care are there for seniors also, so that they have good options for the care, the residence, and the support they need as they get older here in our province.</p>

<p>It has been a challenge over the last four years. We know that the finances of the province haven't been great. The Progressive Conservative Party that was in power for 10 years left us with a financial mess that we had to clean up. I was very glad to see that our government introduced a balanced budget, because then it gives us more options to entertain organizations; it gives us more options to look at projects like the Villa Acadienne and the replacement of that into the future.

<p>If the entire province is to benefit from mega-projects on the horizon, then a sound, fact-based decision to support local employment is both financially prudent and good public policy.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the mayors, wardens and chief administrative officers of the Strait area have raised concerns over the decision by the NDP to move from 12 regional development authorities to six regional enterprise networks, to carry out economic development initiatives in Nova Scotia. The Strait area, which includes municipal units within the Counties of Richmond, Inverness, Guysborough and Antigonish, have a long history of working together on many fronts. They are concerned that having the Strait area divided between two regional enterprise networks will weaken the focus on economic development in the Strait. My question to the minister is, will the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism advise whether his government is open to the proposal for a Strait Area Regional Enterprise Network?</p>

I'm honoured and, at the same time, humbled by being here before my honourable colleagues and all Parties in the historic Chamber of the Nova Scotia Legislature. Never in my thoughts did I think that I would be in this position. I'm proud, privileged, and honoured to represent the riding of Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank and all its citizens of the Province of Nova Scotia. In this hallowed hall, I have to pinch myself every day when I get up - and I hope that continues for a long time.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, congratulations to you in your position as Deputy Speaker and to our Speaker, the MLA for Eastern Shore.</p>
<p>My life journey began to change in 2009, when I received a call from no other than Stephen McNeil. I had never given any thought to running in the political world of provincial politics. At that time he requested me to run in the upcoming election, being a Halifax County councillor in the 1980s and 1990s and being very comfortable at the municipal level of government, I had not considered provincial politics until that call.</p>
<p>I indicated to the Premier, Stephen McNeil, my wife and I were leaving shortly for a trip to the British and American Virgin Islands for two weeks of sailing, 10 days and some travelling, and would give my answer when I returned - I thought this was a better situation than walking in the park in the dead of winter in order to decide my future. My answer is obvious.</p>
<p>From a retired Environment Canada employee in 2007 after 37 years, to the aspiration of a Liberal candidate in 2009, I came second to the Honourable Percy Paris. I re-offered in 2013 and was successfully elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly. An MLA was a life-altering moment, not just for me, but for my family. I have to take this opportunity to thank my opponents at the time: Brian Wong for the PCs and the NDP candidate, the Honourable Percy Paris, for their credible, clean, and well-run election campaigns.</p>
<p>In the last four and a half years and with a lot of effort I worked tirelessly, but enjoyed attending more than 1,000 meetings in the community, out five nights a week and a member of a dozen organizations, chair of four, past president of one, vice-president of another. I attended many other meetings and functions in the Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank area. Some of these will be found in resolutions to come in the future.</p>
<p>Before I go too far in my Reply to the Speech from the Throne, I want to recognize the tremendous support from my wife, Pam, home alone most evenings and many days, and my two daughters, Tracey and Kelly, who stood beside me over the four years to accomplish this endeavour and who recognized and understood the importance to me of becoming an MLA for the Liberal Party. Thanks to my gals, Pam, Tracey, and Kelly. I have to say that Tracey provided the expertise for my brochure, which proved to be instrumental in my election campaign. Thanks to my brother Bob - who has been a Liberal all his life, probably more so than I am, more dedicated to signs and more dedicated to getting around talking to people and a resident of Eastern Passage, living on the original grant of land given to the Hornes in the 1750s - for his campaigning throughout most of the election during the day.</p>
<p>Thanks to my sister Julie for the many calls from Cochrane, west of Calgary, making sure I was okay and wondering how it was going; and to my two grandchildren, Jensen, 10 and Reid, 8, calling on Skype every night asking Grampie how the election is going. They all seemed to understand what was going on and were willing and wanting to come to Wellington and go out on day-to-day campaigning with me.</p>
<p>Also I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my parents, Horace Horne and Emma Horne, who are not with us today. They would have been so proud of me. I am, as far as I know, the only elected politician in the family.</p>
<p>I recognize the diversity that exists in this House and have listened to most of the members' life experiences in reaching their goals. Immigrants today are really not much different. Our family were immigrants in the 1750s and today, still, we are families who live in Nova Scotia not far from where I stand today.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, here's a quick history of the Hornes. In 1751 they were immigrants from the British North America 263 years ago. Two brothers, Jacob, my immediate relative back in those days, and Johanne, his brother, were young Germans who probably could speak French, from the community of Strasburg in the Alsace-Lorraine area, presently part of France. At that time it was part of Germany but it is part of France now. It changed back and forth, depending on the country that won the next battle in the 1700s.</p>
<p>At any rate, the British were looking for young, able, hard-working immigrants to come to Nova Scotia, to North America, and populate this country called Nova Scotia. In 1751 they left Strasburg for Rotterdam where they embarked on a sailing vessel called <i>The Gale</i>, along with over 200 other eager immigrants from countries such as Holland, Denmark, and Sweden.</p>
<p>The trip was long and arduous with many hardships, and after more than three weeks they arrived in Halifax on August 21, 1751. The ship anchored in Halifax Harbour and while all the able-bodied men worked to build the fortress around Halifax, returning at night to the ship, the women and children stayed on board the ship.</p>
<p>These passengers were to go to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, to grants of land and start their new lives. However, this group stayed in Halifax and I'm not sure why, other than that they worked on the fort for most of the summer and the Fall. Jacob and Jean worked and stayed in Halifax but when opportunity knocked, the brothers would travel by vessel up the St. Lawrence River to what is known as P.E.I. today. They both married Acadian gals in 1756, the Savary sisters, who were expelled off their family farms in Grand-Pr&#xE9; in Nova Scotia in 1755. Today the family's name is on the plaque in Grand-Pr&#xE9;.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, they left P.E.I. for Quebec due to a chicken pox outbreak and were given grants of lands in Bellechasse in Quebec City on the St. Lawrence River.</p>
<p>In 1759 both boys fought with General Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City and were navigators for his ships up the St. Lawrence. Jacob returned to Halifax from Quebec after the war with his wife and young family of three. As lore tells us, the family snow-shoed from Quebec to Halifax and was given a grant of land on McNabs Island in Halifax Harbour. They built their home from the wood of wrecked ships on the shoreline of McNabs Island, fished, worked in the woods, and gardened, taking firewood and produce to the Halifax market by boat.</p>
<p>Jacob moved to another grant of land after a short time, to the mainland at Eastern Passage, where the family has thrived for over seven generations. Most Hornes in Nova Scotia are probably related. Also, I have not moved far from the area, to Dartmouth and Wellington in 1970. I lived in Eastern Passage until I was 12, when our family moved to Dartmouth; graduated from Saint Mary's University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science; and worked as a chemist for 25 years at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography for Environment Canada, supervising a chemistry lab engaged in water, air, and sediment studies and research for Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p>In 1995 the labs at BIO were closed, as well as those in Newfoundland, and moved to Moncton. However, I was able to get a position with Environment Canada as an Environmental Assessment officer and Environmental Emergencies officer responding to assessments of major projects, such as offshore oil and gas projects and major pipeline projects and responding to environmental spills, and as a chemist on the HAZMAT team and conducting environmental audits on the drilling platforms near Sable Island.</p>
<p>In 1973 my wife and I moved with two children to Wellington, to our new home on Lake Fletcher. I have been there for the last 40 years, and am still married after 44 years.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I'd like to change the subject a little bit now, after you know a little bit about my ancestry and genealogy. I truly believe in volunteerism. I think volunteerism is probably the finest thing you can do for your community and yourself. The state of community well-being can be judged by the strength and passion of volunteers. Volunteers are the heart and soul of our community. Their passion to succeed or to accomplish their goals is important to all communities. It is my belief that they are the indicators of a thriving community. The riding of Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank is one of these communities.</p>
<p>Our Liberal Government should support volunteer groups and non-profit groups that are registered under the Societies Act by providing funding to MLAs for these groups so they can complete projects and can realize their goals. There are over 120 volunteer groups in our community, and every year more than 80 volunteers and their sponsors are recognized with certificates and a banquet. I have been a member of the Volunteer Awards association for seven years and chair for two years of this riding. The volunteer group is the Volunteer Recognition Awards team. It has been gratifying to be part of such a like-minded volunteer group.</p>
<p>I now would like to recognize a few volunteers who helped me get elected. Without having such a group of 50 dedicated and passionate Liberals, I would not have been elected. I do truly thank each and every one. We called the team Bill's Liberal Team. Slogans on the red shirts were "WE BILLIEVE." Over 100 T-shirts could be seen all over our riding at functions, sports events and barbeques, July 1<sup>st</sup> days and all the time campaigning. Our team once challenged the PCs to a baseball game and our team happened to win 17-6. The PCs had their candidate, Brian Wong, he used one of those Segways, running around the bases on a Segway. He has had an operation on his hips, so he's much better now.</p>
<p>My co-chairs, our councillor for the HRM was one of those, Barry Dalrymple, who works tirelessly and has a work ethic unlike any other and Bill Munden, who can convince at the door, while canvassing nearly everyone to place a sign on their lawn. He probably had an 80 per cent to 90 per cent success rate; nobody else could manage to do that.</p>
<p>It takes a special person to be your OA and that was, Randy Snow, one of the most important positions as far as I'm concerned; he was unbelievable. He was such a well-organized, calm and unflappable person, a stickler for details and paperwork and reports, I never had to worry at all. I must admit that last night I got home and had to sign the final paper that he had to send to the CA, and it was kind of nice.</p>
<p>My fundraising chair was Wayne McRae, and his team was more than successful in raising the needed funds. We accomplished every planned PR event and signage that was needed. We had a youth group and it was led by Mark Joycey and Kirk Pinkney and they promoted an evening with youth to discuss the issues and had a wonderful evening.</p>
<p>My sign team, Fred Wyatt, an 80-year-old, Kirk Stephen, Tim Rand, Dale Schrimpt, Paul Dalrymple, Shawn Dube, David Reid, Jez Thorpe, John Bona, Barry Dalrymple, Leo Meagher, and Brandan MacGillvary. All my signs went up the first weekend after the writ was dropped and keeping them up was a bit of a problem, but we managed to keep things going.</p>
<p>We had many canvassers, Sandra Carr, Bob Horne, Pam Horne, Sandy Burgess, Joyce Munden, Tanya Tattrie, Helen and Scott Young, June Wyatt, Emily Dalrymple, Stephanie Dube, Jen Reid, Joanne Dalrymple, Wayne McRae and Paula Beck.</p>
<p>I just wanted to mention something that I found I was doing quite a bit. One of my goals was to see a lot of homes in a day and I'm a jogger, so I used to jog to the doors. If I talked any more than 10 minutes to any of the residents I would have to jog to the next three houses and I found out I was jogging all of the time. One of those times and the very last day of the campaign I was jogging up a hill as fast as I could to go to the next house, I had to get to the last 500 homes. Anyway, I didn't do that, but as I was jogging up I was passed by my competitor, the PC candidate, Brian Wong. He was on his Segway and he passed me; he stopped about 50 feet past and he turned around and laughed and he got off and talked for the next half hour. That closed out the campaign. At that time he said he went to 6,327 homes, but he started in May, I didn't start until October, until the writ was down. It didn't seem to matter, but at the time I was quite worried that maybe he had done something I didn't do. At any rate the turnout was for me.</p>
<p>My office manager, Joyce Munden and her team, Sandy Burgess, June Wyatt, Emily Dalrymple, Pam Horne and Tattrie, and Helen Young. I had a Web site group, Greame Van Leer and Patrick Smith, and a sign-maker, Victor Cobb of Beaver Bank. Also, I would be remiss if I didn't thank all the workers who worked the day of the election. We had 34 working at the different polls.</p>
<p>Our communities are very progressive, with many new subdivisions. We have many bedroom communities considered suburban and rural in nature, and most building lots are an acre or larger with their own water and septic systems. Most people commute to Halifax and Dartmouth, resulting in many traffic tie-ups in the morning and evening, and as a result, safety issues with Highway No. 118 and Highway No. 102, which have been talked about with TIR.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I think one thing that all Nova Scotians want is strong, economically viable communities. One of the things that should be known, when it comes to the regional enterprise networks, is that this is led by the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities. We are one of the stakeholders and the downsizing of the RDAs was one of the recommendations that was put forth a few years ago by Donald Savoie. The municipalities thought that this was an appropriate avenue to take and certainly as far as we, the government, are concerned, we are open to listen to anything. The door hasn't been closed on anything yet.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to hear that response. Projects such as the Melford container terminal, the proposed Bear Head liquefied natural gas site, and possible expansion of NuStar Terminal in Point Tupper, present exciting possibilities for the economy of the Strait area, yet having the Strait divided between two regional enterprise networks - one for all of Cape Breton Island and one for Guysborough, Antigonish and Pictou Counties - will certainly weaken the focus of these projects and others for the Strait area. My question for the minister is, is the minister prepared to meet with the mayors, wardens and chief administrative officers of the municipal units in the Strait area to explore the possibility of a stand-alone Strait Area Regional Enterprise Network?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In 2005 the former NDP Minister of Finance and member for Halifax Fairview understood bracket creep. If I may quote, it was said at the time, "There is no increase in the income tax rates but, let's make no mistake about it, this budget includes an increase in income tax, but it does it indirectly not directly. There are two principal ways the government is doing that, and one is that there is no inflation indexing of the tax brackets. So while inflation marches along, the tax brackets do not. Simply by virtue of inflation, more people move into a higher tax bracket." My question for the current Minister of Finance, does the current minister - if the NDP cared about bracket creep in 2005, why are they 0 for 4 in addressing the matter in their last four budgets?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I've been in this House for 15 years, and one of the things that I do remember was when Premier Hamm and the government of the day decoupled the federal and provincial income tax systems. That led to provincial income tax no longer being indexed, so there's nothing new here. I don't know how many Finance Ministers we've had since that time, but I venture there have been three or four, anyway.</p>
<p>Taxes support the services that Nova Scotians rely on. I'm very proud that this year we've been able to bring the province back to a balanced position. We've been able to introduce some modest tax measures to provide relief to small businesses and to senior citizens and people who live with low incomes.</p>
<p>That's quite an accomplishment, given the mess that this government inherited. We will look into other tax measures in the future, but let's get this budget through, and I'll be looking forward to the support of the honourable member when that vote comes.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6918f31d-8900-4400-a42c-b0374b14b8ff"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I think the minister highlights the importance of keeping one's word here in the Legislature. I know for myself I've always kept my word in here, which is something that members on the opposite side haven't, with respect to bracket creep.</p>
<p>We also have to wonder about how the state of this province would be if Nova Scotians had to endure what these members opposite suggested we do when they voted against balanced budgets in the last eight years before they inherited government, so that needs to be put on the record.</p>
<p>I want to quote, Mr. Speaker, one more time from the former Minister of Finance, and that is, "Let's make no mistake about it, this is a tax increase measure, the government's continuing refusal or inability to index tax brackets." He also said, "That is as much of a tax grab as if the Minister of Finance reached into your pocket or into your wallet or into your purse and took out the money."</p>
<p>My question for the minister is, does the current Minister of Finance feel as if she has reached into the wallets and purses of Nova Scotians and taken their money?</p></speech>

I just happened to look up and see Mr. Rick Clarke, president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour - and a Springhiller - in the gallery. I don't know if they noticed him on the government side, because he is sitting in the Opposition gallery, where, of course, he is more than welcome to be. I just wanted to recognize that he was there.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this bill, intergenerational reporting, a bill that I believe is of tremendous importance, because it would be a great step forward in the way that the province is governed, truly bring Nova Scotia into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. The bill, quite simply, requires that in addition to the 12 months budgeting that goes on in this House, in addition to the day-to-day, short-term decision making that goes on on the government side, that once in a while the House and the government be required to report on the effect of today's decisions on the next generation of Nova Scotians, and that every five years the government be required to account for its decisions not just to today's taxpayers and voters and citizens, but to the next generation.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that report, of course, would include the state of the province's finances and whether they are truly in balance or not, but also the state of the social health of the province, the state of the province's environment and whether today's decisions are creating an environmental deficit any more than they create a financial deficit, or a surplus, because young Nova Scotians want to know that they are being looked after today in all of these ways, even in the demographics of the province. Are more people coming to Nova Scotia than leaving, or the other way around? And what does that mean for the long-term economic and social well-being of the province?</p>
<p>These are the things that we want the government to report on and that all Nova Scotians want to know are being taken into account when government makes decisions. I'll give you a few examples, Madam Speaker. Nova Scotians now know that the Auditor General of Nova Scotia reported to the people that he believed the question of the ever-escalating pile of debt that is building up in our province, now the second-highest per person in the country, raises ethical questions about whether that is fair to the young Nova Scotians who are going to be left to pay the bills for today's decisions. Decisions that the NDP have made today might look very different if they were required to account for those decisions to the next generation of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>When the NDP came into office and repealed the balanced budget law, and started a string of four consecutive deficit budgets, that decision might look very different if they were required to answer not just to today's House of Assembly, but to a whole new generation of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The Liberals are no better. While they complain about deficits and debt, they go out and they do polling to decide whether they are going to be in favour of actually doing something about it or not. They flip and they flop. They look at polls to tell them whether it's right to stop the growth in debt, whether it's right to balance the budget or not. But if, like the NDP, the Liberals were required to answer that question, not just by relying on polls but also by answering to a whole new generation of Nova Scotians, perhaps even they would be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing for our kids, and that is to say no more to the growth in debt, and all those bills that we hand on to them to pay, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>In fact, even reporting to their own members, perhaps the Liberals wouldn't be running a deficit in their own Party's books if they knew that ultimately they have to look beyond just today, when they make their own decisions and that Nova Scotians can look and judge them, like they will judge the NDP and us, on whether we're ready to form a government based on whether we can even run our own affairs. Those are the kinds of decisions that people can only make when they know the facts about how each Party runs its own affairs, whether they complain about deficits but run them themselves, or not, that is one of the benefits of requiring these kinds of reports, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>I'll give you another example. Power rates and power policy is another great example. One would have to wonder, would the decisions of the government be different where they commit Nova Scotia to 35-year, $1.5 billion decisions, clearly leaving the bills for many more generations of Nova Scotians to pay, acknowledging that those decisions today will add 1 per cent or 2 per cent every year to our already sky-high power rates? Maybe if they were required to answer not just to today's Nova Scotia but to the next generation of Nova Scotia, those decisions would be very different.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, one can just imagine what the last election campaign would have looked like if politicians were required to account for what the say in the long run. What Nova Scotians now know, four years into an NDP Government, is no one asked them, the NDP didn't ask them, the Liberals didn't ask them, no one asked Nova Scotians in the 2009 election, do you want to pay more for power? Are you willing to pay more for power so that the NDP can brag that they have the highest renewable targets in all of North America?</p>
<p>Perhaps Nova Scotians would have voted differently if they had been given an accurate question, and this bill would point to an accurate question. What we now know is Nova Scotians have seen their power bill skyrocket by over 30 per cent, that they do not want to pay more than they can afford, and yet no one asked them that in the last election.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, for the Liberal Party to run TV ads promoting a policy that actually jacks our power rates up even more and manages to eliminate any hope of private investment in renewables at the same time - that is an amazing trick. The very policies that they promote have been proven a failure in New Brunswick, in Ontario, in Texas, in California, in all of those places the very policies that they advertise on TV, both drive up our power rates and stop the investment in renewables at the same time. That is why it's important that they, too, be held accountable for what they say not just today, but for the future. The only responsible power policy that meets the test of today and tomorrow is to freeze power rates, not charge Nova Scotians more, and invest in renewables in a way that Nova Scotians can actually afford. That's why this bill is so important.</p>
<p>I could move on to taxes because the government has chosen to pull $3 out of the pockets of everyday Nova Scotians for every $1 the government, itself, plans to find in so-called savings to try to get to a balanced budget - $3 from us for every $1 from itself is not a balanced approach to budgeting. That is why so many Nova Scotians are skeptical about what the government is claiming about this budget because they are the ones who are left to pay while the government lets its own accounts off the hook.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the NDP were required to report not just to today's voters, but to tomorrow's Nova Scotians about why they want Nova Scotia to have the highest taxes in all of Canada, user fees that have skyrocketed beyond the ability of Nova Scotians to pay, and on and on and on, perhaps then we could get some sanity when it comes to tax policy in this province, perhaps then young Nova Scotians would stand up and say, when you do that more and more of us move away, more and more of us go to Ontario or Alberta, where there are more jobs, where there are lower taxes.</p>
<p>Lower taxes and more jobs go together, and only when you report on all of those things can you truly make responsible decisions as a province. But no one asks them; no one asks the very next generation of Nova Scotians who have to pay those taxes, who have to make those career decisions, who have to decide who to believe on jobs, on the economy, on power rates. No one asked them and that is the problem and that is exactly the problem that this bill will solve, hold all Parties to account for the crazy things they say today because, ultimately, tomorrow &#x2026;</p></speech>

          <speech by="#de2082f3-cf3a-4955-8a4e-4f1bf0ac1301"><from>MR. MAT WHYNOTT</from><p>Madam Speaker, I don't even know where to begin with this bill because it's quite rich coming from the Progressive Conservative Party about accountability and trying to make decisions based on informed information that is informed. I find the Progressive Conservatives of Nova Scotia are the all-time big spenders in this. Let's not forget that it was just prior to the 2003 provincial election it was the Progressive Conservative Party that said what we're going to do is pass out $150 cheques to everybody in the Province of Nova Scotia - will that decision be the best thing for our next generations?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I've heard from many of my colleagues who have been in this House since that time and they said, at that point in history, people were donating those $155 cheques back to charities. People were giving donations to campaigns - the $150 cheques - because they were so enraged that the Progressive Conservative Party would give $150 cheques to everybody across the province - cheques.</p>
<p>What would you do with a cheque? Of course, I would never say this in this Chamber, but why would you give $155 cheques days before an election, Madam Speaker? Why would you do that? That is the reality about the Progressive Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the Liberal Party later but I do want to talk a little bit about the Progressive Conservative Party, Madam Speaker. Let's also talk about the Progressive Conservative Party in this Chamber that brought forward a plan when it came to refurbishing one of the much-needed infrastructure needs in our province, which was around physical fitness - physical fitness which some of us, including myself, need to do a little bit more.</p>
<p>The Progressive Conservative Party brought forward a 10-year plan. It was called the B-FIT program, a 10-year program to invest in recreational facilities right across our province. Madam Speaker, they brought forward a plan that would ensure that the next generation would be able to - this was an investment in what they called the next generation and this was going to be a sustainable program for 10 years so that we could really make a difference in the physical fitness of our communities.</p>
<p>What did they do, Madam Speaker? They spent it all in two years and when did they spend it? They spent it prior to an election. That is the Progressive Conservative Party, talking about investing in our next generation, investing with informed decisions - $68 million that was spent in two years.</p>
<p>Another example, Madam Speaker, is they brought forward an example of a hospital in Colchester that was much-needed for that community. But the interesting part is they brought forward a hospital without a plan, decisions that could have been informed if they had a plan in place for our next generation, exactly what this bill is talking about, having informed decisions; but classic Tory, they didn't do it.</p>
<p>Another example, Madam Speaker, is allowing spending in government. Now this is a Progressive Conservative Party. I know Progressive Conservatives don't like government, they would prefer a smaller government, but this is what I find interesting. The Progressive Conservative Party, when they were in government in the last little bit, between 1999 to 2009, spending in government departments rose by 6, 7 and 8 per cent, depending on the year you look. They were just handing over money, hoping to fix problems - classic Tory. They say they have a plan but never follow through on it. That's exactly the sort of thing that they're saying this bill would do, but maybe they would hire a fancy-pants consultant like Corpus Sanchez in 2008, to reform our health care system, a $1 million consultant and there's only one person who got a job out of that, and that was the executive assistant to the Minister of Health who got a job out of that.</p>
<p>Another example of the Progressive Conservatives making decisions about our finances, we know that our offshore revenues peaked in 2008. We had over $450 million in offshore royalties coming into the province as revenue, so the Progressive Conservatives built programs based on money that they could not guarantee would come in every year. The Progressive Conservatives did that, Madam Speaker, so I find it ironic that this bill is before us in the Legislature - and of course I could not forget the issue of the kiddie ATVs, a decision that I'm sure the Progressive Conservative members across the way would be hanging their heads in shame.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I've done enough to the Progressive Conservatives; now I want to talk a little bit about the Liberal Party because, of course, if this bill was to ever come forward, whoever had their way - now all three Parties in this Legislative Assembly, whenever the election is called, have the ability to form a government. That's the reality. That's what elections are.</p>
<p>One of the ways this bill would - we have to have accountability in the decisions of whatever Party is in power, but I can tell you that in the past, the decisions of the Liberal Party were to bring forward P3 contracts for our schools. We've been paying those fees. We've been paying those leasing fees for the last 14 years, and no matter who's in power in the coming years, the government of the day would have to decide whether or not we're going to buy those schools for our children. If we were to buy all of those schools - an additional $250 million. An additional $250 million is an example of when decisions in the past remain without having informed decisions.</p>
<p>Another example, Madam Speaker, is when the Liberal Party, luckily, didn't have their way, but what they did was that they were proposing to borrow $600 million to pay down the debt of the DHAs - $600 million, just borrowing the money, and how does that work? Another example of decisions made and not thinking about our future generations was the decision to close 1,500 hospital beds - 1,500 hospital beds that the Liberal Party closed, and they fired 1,000 nurses, told them to leave the province.</p>
<p>We're still paying for their decisions. That's the reality. That is the reality of the Liberal Party in this province. They tore up the teachers' collective bargaining rights and rolled back people's wages. This government has been able to contain government spending so that we don't see these large inflationary costs in our province.</p>
<p>The member for Yarmouth was speaking earlier today, and he was talking across the way about amalgamation. He said that he agreed with amalgamation. He agreed with forcing the HRM to come forward. He said that was a good decision. Well, talk to the other municipal units during that time. People were not happy with the decision of the Liberal Government of that day.</p>
<p>You know, the only foresight the Liberal Party saw when they were ever in government was that they would put a tax on every bottle of liquor in this province. That's what the Liberals did, and they put it in their own coffers. They put it in for electioneering purposing, and I can't believe that the Liberal Party would do something like that.</p>
<p>I know what our government has done. We've ended "March madness'. We've made sure that we've lived within our means. We've made strategic decisions and disciplinary decisions in how we spend our money. We are turning the corner on 20 years of the slowest economic growth in Canada, with large new projects like Muskrat Falls, the shipbuilding contract, and the Nova Centre. I wish I could go on, I really do, but thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <heading>MAR. LOBSTER PANEL REPT. - TIMELY RESPONSE</heading>
          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand in late debate to speak for a few moments in regard to this resolution.</p>
<p>As many of you know, southwestern Nova Scotia, especially the Municipality of the District of Barrington, would be known as the lobster capital of Canada. The majority of the industry there revolves in and around the fishery. The fishery is one that I think every year at the start of the season, if not at the end of the season, that people will start to question the price, question the validity of the industry, will re-question exactly what they should be doing to make that fishery better. Many times lots of ideas are flown around and I'm sure if you asked the 800 to 900 licence holders in the districts, you would probably have 800 to 900 different ideas of how to fix the industry.</p>
<p>I can say in southwestern Nova Scotia the last number of weeks have been an interesting start to the lobster fishery in Districts 34, 33, 32, I had been away a few weeks prior to that, and one that has had its weather events - some storms and a late start to the season. As far as we understand at this point, as we talk to the buyers, talk to individuals in the industry, we're looking at about a $4 lobster, a $4 plus 25 cents in some cases. Depending on what happens over the next number of days will hopefully increase that price. The catches are relatively good in District 34 - great to report that - not so good in District 33 as you go around past the Baccaro line going to the east.</p>
<p>Really, Madam Speaker, the point of the discussion here today is maybe to question the minister and see what is going to be happening over the next number of weeks. We have the Maritime Lobster Panel, which reported back a number of months ago, one that has a whole bunch of good recommendations, all of them very, very difficult and I would say "hot potatoes" for this government to try to manage. Some of them actually require, I believe, decisions by this summer, so we're looking at August 2014 in some cases to come up with an action item on behalf of this government.</p>
<p>Let me go through maybe some of the recommendations, the ones that I find interesting and ones I find that might be a challenge - and that I know we would like to hear from the minister or the government of the day of how they are going to react to these ones. All of them I think will make a stronger industry, but all of them again will be a very difficult thing to do and definitely a hot potato.</p>
<p>The first one is the challenge that I find the most difficult, which is the organization itself - the organization of the fisheries which is the number-one recommendation in the report. It talks about that fishermen should come together and "where not already in place, establish and participate in well-organized, representative fishermen's organizations. These organizations should come together under a provincial organization structure (similar to the way fishermen do in PEI). These provincial organizations should have the capacity to work together from an East Coast perspective and engage US counterparts to jointly address issues related to the entire lobster industry."</p>
<p>It really doesn't say within that recommendation who should be responsible for it, but at the same time if we're talking about Nova Scotia, then we're talking about maybe a Nova Scotia responsibility. As you may know, the fishery is split up by a number of LFAs, Lobster Fishing Associations, that speak on behalf - so we've got management boards and advisory boards and different groups right across the province, all of them speaking sometimes in different ways, but all of them working very hard for their respective industries and trying to find a solution to their problems.</p>
<p>Exactly how are we going to be organizing these groups into one coherent voice? I see it quite often, especially in southwestern Nova Scotia, the strength of our fishery is the independence. At the same time, probably one of the biggest problems we have is the independence itself, because there is a lot of - jealously might not be the right word, but everybody is sort of wondering how the next person is going to do and making sure that people don't get ahead and to try to manage that. But the recommendation is very clear within the report that we need to find a way to organize the fishery in southwestern Nova Scotia all across the province in order to do that. It's going to take a lot of work on behalf of this government to get that done, so how is that going to get done?</p>
<p>The second recommendation is definitely one that fits in the discussion with the minister and DFO because a lot of the recommendations have a cross-governmental problem where they have to petition the DFO - the Department of Fisheries and Oceans - on how to manage the fishery. Of course, the management of the fishery, when it comes to the true management plan, is the responsibility of the federal government. One that I'm not really supportive of, but it is an interesting one, is Recommendation 3, the rationalization to work with the government on the rationalization, which means a fewer number of fishermen, fisher people, licences within the system - definitely a challenge, I think, for the minister to work with that one.</p>
<p>There are a number of recommendations in there that are based with DFO but one that the minister has to work towards. The consensus approach of our organizations has always been difficult where they always have to have 60 per cent to 70 per cent acceptance on any change that happens to the industry, which is one they've never been able to get. The best example is the work done prior to this fishing season, where there were a number of ideas floated out, I believe, by the advisory board. Once the balloting happened and the vote happened, they were rejected by the fishermen themselves. So how do we get beyond that one?</p>
<p>There are the more specific issues for the province in how we work with the Fish Harvester Organizations Support Act, which is an Act that was brought forward by the previous government, one that is underlined within this report, to try to strengthen. Is it the intention of the government to do that or not? Is it going to be bringing in its own similar bill in order to do this? We're never too sure.</p>
<p>I know I'm running out of time really quickly. It's an extremely large and complicated industry and one that, I believe, needs this government's support and attention. I think it is one that the minister has been sincere in saying that he is willing to work with all sides of this House of Assembly to come up with the best possible solutions to it, and it is one that I hope he really means and I'm sure we'll hear in a few moments about that. I can say that I would be more than happy to work with him on this issue, as well as with the member for Queens-Shelburne, the previous minister, because many of these issues are much larger than we who sit in this Legislature. They are of the utmost importance to the issues of southwestern Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>One last pitch that I'll send across - I have only one minute left - is the issue of the lobster cannery in southwestern Nova Scotia. I hope that he had the opportunity to sit down and chat with Erica Smith and Buzzy Smith, or Alton Smith and the group of volunteers in that organization who are trying to put something together for a better value chain in lobster, one that is going to be difficult and a big question for the minister to address.</p>
<p>Finally, it is just simply what are you going to do with these recommendations? How are they going to roll out and what can we expect to be pulled together in having this great discussion? Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>It's a pleasure for me to get up and speak a little bit about this bill. Madam Speaker, when I looked at what this bill is about, it strikes me as highly unrealistic. It's a suggestion that every five years the government will report on financial and fiscal and different government policies that have come into play, and it will report on how that's going to affect people 45 years in the future.</p>
<p>It's clear that right now we see the difficulty in forecasting one year into the future. The NDP's current budget and estimates for the coming year are, again, part of a narrative that's been created by the government to go into an election with, to create a story that looks positive when in fact it is not - when all the indicators, financial and otherwise, are saying that we are not going to see huge increases in revenue. It's difficult for politicians and government staff to forecast one year out, let alone looking 45 years out to see the impact of their decisions. What sounds nice in this bill, it sounds nice to call it an intergenerational bill, it sounds like a good idea to consider the impact on the future, but it is highly unrealistic. I think that says a lot about what we see right there.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Third Party went on at some length about power policies and other issues that while very interesting really don't have a great deal to do with this budget. The one thing we know about the Conservative budgets and how they approach finance is that they say one thing and they do something different in government. The Leader of the Third Party has taken a page right out of Harper's book, the Prime Minister of Canada, and saying in Opposition that he's going to balance budgets, that he wants balanced budget legislation and so on, when in fact we only have to look at the last six or seven years here in Canada, under the Harper Government, and we can see that they took it from a huge surplus left by the Liberals to deficits every single year that they've been in power. They completely squandered large surpluses that were put in place through difficult fiscal measures in the 1990s, which the NDP here in this province love to hearken back to. At the time when the Liberal Government took power in 1993, the province was bankrupt.</p>
<p>At the first Cabinet meeting that was held they were told that although they were only two or three months into the fiscal year there was no money in the coffers - imagine that, if you were in Cabinet and had to face the fact that the previous Progressive Conservative Government had completely squandered an entire year's worth of payments in two or three months, not even a quarter of the way through the year. That was what the Liberal Government was faced with, after years of just squandering money, wasting money and buying electronic toilet seats, and God knows what else, under the Progressive Conservative Government. We remember that kind of fiscal management and it was abominable; it was abhorrent. I think the Progressive Conservatives in Opposition and outside of government love to preach that they are fiscally responsible, that they're literally big "C" Conservative - they are not, the Harper Government has not been Conservative, neither have previous Progressive Conservative Governments in this province.</p>
<p>It is a bit ironic that it is the Liberal Party that had shown the greatest amount of concern for people, balanced with financial concerns. We are the Party that has found that balance. The opposite Party here, the NDP in government have absolutely abandoned all of their principles, all of their social democratic principles, all their "sister this" and "brother that", out the door, that's where it is - and the labour unions darn well know it. The labour leaders know that, the labour union members know that, your social democratic principles have gone out the window to be more conservative than the Rodney MacDonald Government was before you. (Applause)</p>
<p>It's difficult to encourage people to be active and interested in politics when there is so much hypocrisy that surrounds me today; it really is. The Leader of the Third Party is talking a good talk with this kind of intergenerational talk, but he knows how to cut a good deal for himself as well. The Leader of the Third Party has benefited considerably from federal appointments by Prime Minister Harper, including seats on the board of the Halifax Airport Authority &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>I was mentioning that the Leader of the Third Party has benefited greatly from federal appointments from Prime Minister Harper, including seats on a number of boards including the Halifax Airport Authority and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. The Leader of the Third Party stated that he stands for cutting wasteful public spending, all the while he has claimed stipends and travel costs from Prime Minister Harper totalling $310,275 in federal tax dollars. The Leader of the Third Party earned $25,000 to attend 25 board meetings and claimed $9,000 in travel costs alone.</p>

WHALEN</from><p>We're talking here about whether or not people live by the philosophy that they espouse in bills like Bill No. 6, which is before us, this concern about the future, about good fiscal policy, about making decisions that are good for the future and I'm saying that there are things that we need to know about how people manage their affairs that have to do with emulating - and I'm talking about the Third Party and the Leader of the Third Party and how his stance today emulates that of Prime Minister Harper, when he was in Opposition, promising there would be only balanced budgets in the future and then in fact delivering us budget after budget that's been in deficit, year after year in deficit, growing debt every single year. That was an extremely right-wing, Conservative person, a right-wing Conservative Government, and yet, at the end of the day, we've seen year after year of huge deficits. That's what we can expect from the Third Party and they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth when they bring in this kind of a bill to ask us to consider something that is not even workable.</p>
<p>I was also speaking about the fact that the NDP Government has surprised everybody and, actually from the outset, has been more conservative than Rodney MacDonald's government, which was rather profligate in its spending, which kind of hearkens back to earlier governments that we've seen as well. The Progressive Conservative Government, through the 1980s, added more than half of the debt that we currently carry on the books of Nova Scotia. They added it by not knowing how to say no, by giving to everything, by having huge largesse and all the while carrying the banner that they were conservative, which is completely an oxymoron; their behaviour and their name completely do not match. That's what we can expect in the future.</p>
<p>There are a lot of points that I want to raise this afternoon, but I think it's important that we point out that people and governments and Parties should remain true to what they stand for. In particular, we had years of hearing from the NDP in Opposition who took a very high moral stand on a lot of issues. Very often they were saying things that I liked to hear, that I thought sounded good, but even my own excitement about seeing a change in government - because we needed a change from Rodney MacDonald's years as our Premier, we needed to go in a new direction - I thought, okay, we have an NDP Government for the first time, let's see where they go.</p>
<p>They have disappointed Nova Scotians across the board and they've disappointed their base and the union membership and the union leadership of this province. They've disappointed the poor who expected some real improvements in their lives, and across the board it's been a disappointing four years for Nova Scotia. Absolutely. Bill No. 6 doesn't offer any legitimate improvement to finances in this province and it's coming from a Party whose history does not support any fiscal management. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure to stand here in my place today and say a few words about Bill No. 6. Every day I think about how our decisions in this House have an impact on the future of our children and our grandchildren. I think that all governments and all Parties need to be accountable to the young people who are coming forward. I believe that it is imperative that we understand the impact of today's decisions on our finances, on our future, on our environment, and on our social conscience as we move forward in this province that we all love so dearly.</p>
<p>Now we're in here, and we have different ideas and different thoughts of how things should be done. The one thing I do believe is that each and every person is here to try to do the best job they can for the people they represent and for the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has an aging population, and that means there will be fewer workers to support the retirees and the children of this province. To maintain a strong, fair, and resilient Nova Scotia, we need to plan for the future, and we need to plan now. Nova Scotia's ability to meet future challenges depends on actions that we take in this House of Assembly every day. Acting properly now avoids more drastic action later, when problems start to escalate.</p>
<p>So how do we do that? As a group, we have to look at where we're going and what the decisions we make are going to cost the people of the Province of Nova Scotia. What are those decisions going to cost your children and my children and our grandchildren? What are we going to be able to do to make sure that the kind of province that we've enjoyed is there for our children to enjoy? This bill is a start toward that: making sure that we look at the decisions we make, check them out, and see if they're actually going to work down the road.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think there's anybody in this House - and I certainly know that I don't think I have all the answers. There's nobody more surprised than me at the changes in the way technology and lives have been going on here in Nova Scotia. So to think that we, as a group, can sit here and make legislation and make decisions of where we're going in the future without that future changing and without that future having different impacts than it has today would not be something that I think this group of people would want to do.</p>
<p>We all know that the variables are changing as we move forward. How we are going to move as a province is changing day by day, hour by hour. Now, no piece of legislation is perfect, but it has been my experience that we have to start somewhere. The Auditor General raised the issue of whether a deficit is moral. Well, do you know what? The reason he did that is because we load spending onto the young and we make future generations pay for services consumed today. This bill is to help address that.</p>
<p>It's time that we had a formal and transparent way of taking stock of what we're leaving behind, what we're asking our children and grandchildren to pay for. We need a process that makes us think and account for what it is that we are passing in this House of Assembly.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this bill helps to focus our thinking on doing the right thing. A few weeks ago - maybe a week ago - I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Halifax Clayton Park speak to the principle of transparency. I view the member for Halifax Clayton Park as a person with high character who does the right thing. It was very telling when she decided to defend the failings of her own Party leadership on another issue of transparency. It was a great example of an issue of how we should do the right thing. It was a great example of how politicians should be transparent about the things that they do, where people will have trouble believing they did the right thing. It was a great example of how politicians should account to a new generation for the actions of the past. I don't think she would have made the same choice herself and she would have been right not to do so.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, now we're moving forward and looking at this bill. There's an argument that is essentially an aging population and a slower population growth is likely to produce a gap between spending and revenues. That gap will increase government debt, it will increase it higher and will impose higher taxes on our next generation. That means that higher taxes would mean smaller pay packets and less disposable income for the ordinary Nova Scotian.</p>
<p>With the workforce being a shrinking portion of the population as the population ages, the tax burden becomes heavier and heavier for the working-age person. By 2036 there will be 1.68 times more Nova Scotians over 65 than there are right now, according to the Department of Finance statistics. The number of people over 85 will have doubled. By contrast, the number of Nova Scotians under the age of 19 will have dropped by almost 12,000 people. The decline in the natural increase of the population started to accelerate in the first half of the 1990s, dropping from 4,800 in 1991 to 2,900 in 1995. This bill is important for us to help secure the future of the young people in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We need to look at where we are, we need to figure out where we have to go, and we have to figure out a way that we're paying for it and it's not our children and grandchildren that are paying for it. This bill is a stepping stone towards that. This bill will make some more accountability in the process that we enjoy in the Province of Nova Scotia. The people in this House have a genuine interest, regardless of their political stature, in where we go. We need to work together to make sure that there is the ability for the young people of this province to enjoy the type of life that I've had the opportunity - I know most of you here in the House have had an opportunity - to enjoy.</p>
<p>If this bill were to be moved forward it would need work. But, Madam Speaker, if you don't start a journey you'll never complete it. This bill is the beginning of a journey that will help the young people of the Province of Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#3b49aa8d-3e78-4679-b8f7-f3161f11d3a3"><from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's certainly an honour and a privilege to talk about this timely topic here tonight. The resolution reads a timely response by the sitting government on the Maritime Lobster Panel Report. I can say that I'm also privileged and honoured to initiate part of the recommendations to the industry. I remember very distinctly being in Antigonish when that recommendation, when I was on the podium with a packed house - I'll get into that later.</p>
<p>This particular recommendation came out last Spring, or late Spring, I believe, if my timing is right, into May or early June, when we had 1,500 vessels tied up in northern New Brunswick and in P.E.I. regarding low prices. We worked with the Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Rural Development from P.E.I. and the Department of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries from New Brunswick on this particular topic, and we appointed a panel. I want to recognize them first of all, before I get into some of my remarks, but first of all, Ministers Olscamp from New Brunswick and MacKinley from P.E.I., and the authors of this particular report, the Lobster Panel Report: Gilles Th&#xE9;riault, from New Brunswick; John Hanlon, from Nova Scotia; and Lewis Creed, representing P.E.I. I had the opportunity to read this mid-November, and there are 33 recommendations.</p>
<p>I can tell you what I said that night in Antigonish. As a fisherman, my background, Madam Speaker, I spent 38 years on the water. I have literally gone through what they're feeling and what they were doing in that particular time then. I know very well the feeling of low prices. When fishermen, the fishers' industry, make the decision to tie their vessels at the wharf, they are making that a statement, and to me, there are a number of great recommendations that have been set aside.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that I can speak with confidence in saying that all will not be endorsed. What needs to be done now - and I have taken the time to speak with a number of my colleagues across P.E.I., New Brunswick, and in my hometown to digest these recommendations. I think that the industry, the stakeholders are going through this as we speak. They need to come forward, and nothing to me - that I hope the government and the industry partners will gain a consensus of where they want to go. I heard this from both speakers earlier, that we all want to work together on this and we should adopt - the industry needs to give a clear message to stakeholders on what the industry and all involved want to adopt and endorse, and we need to move forward.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances, Madam Speaker, is that we put any regulations in place unless we have the inshore fishers' consent. I know them, I've been involved with them, and this is a crucial part - and to me, the number one priority. This is one of the reasons why I wanted this job, is that the first priority with all of us is to protect the independence of the inshore fisheries.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Argyle-Barrington stated very eloquently that this was a benefit to the tax base of Barrington. I know that area very well - I spent nine years as warden - but I just want to correct him on one point. He made reference to the lobster capital of Canada and I understand that immensely. (Interruption) I want to point out to the member who just brought that comment. What is important to all the Atlantic Provinces, including the New England States, from Rhode Island right across the Atlantic Provinces, up through Maine, all five Atlantic Provinces to Newfoundland and Labrador - the lobster industry is the economic engine that drives all rural communities, and there is the point right there. (Applause)</p>
<p>What we need is this consensus of working together and bringing those ideas forward, because when I go home, I find it interesting when I drive by marinas and I see that the seasonal boats, the pleasure boats, are drawn up on the bank. They took a lot of time to seasonalize those recreational boats, but that's the time in many areas across Atlantic Nova Scotia, including southwestern Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy, that the fishers actually start to go out on the water in their winter fishery. That's an important point. This is why it's important that we get this right.</p>
<p>Some of the questions that I raised early in Question Period today - or not today, but over this earlier session, and the sessions that may go on in the next while - is the support. I've asked for support. These are important questions about support for MSC - Marine Stewardship Council - certification for lobsters that are competing in the European market. Maine has introduced that; P.E.I. is in that process. We need to have that certification to be in that marketplace because we are dealing with bountiful harvests in our lobster industry, where we are dealing with larger volumes, and now we need to get out and find new homes for these lobsters and make sure that we are competing in these new markets in China and Asia and so on.</p>
<p>The other important part is that the minister talked about marketing and quality and my interest is - are we committed? Are we committed as a government? Are we going to finance to find those new markets? They are there; we just have to be aggressive and go out and do that. I really believe the industry is going to be demanding some of those requests.</p>
<p>My final point tonight is that I've seen this industry - in a lot of places in rural Nova Scotia we are literally down to one main industry and that is the lobster industry. When you come to those boats or to the wharves across Nova Scotia, other than in the lobster season, 90 per cent, or a higher number, are literally tied to the wharf. That needs to change. That needs to change and I'll table - not to get into it - but I went to Ottawa in February 2013 and I'll table the presentation that I made there.</p>
<p>To me, this is about diversifying the industry and while we sit as a government we'll commit to finding, or paying for the science, to develop two new species. The fishermen know that these undeveloped species are out there. I can show that in the presentation to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, we talked about stone crab, whelks, and I'll just make reference to stone crabs.</p>
<p>The fishermen know these species are out there and we need to diversify this industry to give people other opportunities. I heard it from the minister in his remarks that he wants to keep people in these coastal communities. We all want to do the same thing. If you have a commitment from the sitting government, regardless of what Atlantic Province you're in, to develop two new species, just do the multiplication, and the federal government needs to match that.</p>
<p>What I said in my presentation is that your science is out of date. Your science is obsolete because it is based on 30-year-old science. I can tell you right now as a fisherman, my background, my observation strictly from a fisherman's point of view - you talk to any fisherman on the wharf, they see temperature rising, climate change and since the cod moratorium was introduced in the early 1990s, they see a difference of predator relationship between lobsters and fin fish. They have experienced an explosion in shellfish so therefore they see the crabs, shrimp, and all the shellfish species literally exploding and saying, we want to go after that. We want to stay in these communities. We want to have jobs for our people and we need to diversify and give these communities these opportunities.</p>
<p>Getting back to the report, there are opportunities there to solve this. The report has given 33 recommendations. The industry needs to come together, get a consensus on where you want to go and as elected officials we need to work with stakeholders to achieve that and we will keep people in rural Nova Scotia. Thank you for the time.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to stand and speak a few moments on Bill No. 35. I think this is the second time that we've put it through the House of Assembly; I think it's probably the second time or third time that we've had the opportunity to talk about it. I want to welcome a number of people in the gallery today to witness it without having to look at it on a little tiny TV screen that I know they do watch quite often on Legislative TV. I welcome them here today to the talk, Mr. Tracy and Mr. Clarke for being here today.</p>
<p>Many times that we've talked about this, it's about putting patients first. I believe patients, a lot of times when it comes to labour negotiations, that they tend to be put to the side and I think too often that has happened in the past, and one that I don't feel is right. It's not about protecting a political interest, it's about making sure health care services are there for Nova Scotians when they need them, even when there is a threat of a labour disruption. This bill provides for an alternative resolution of contract dispute in health care that avoids work stoppages or even the threat of those stoppages as well. At the same time the bill respects the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p>Last Spring, 3,300 Capital Health care workers were poised to walk off the job. Just the threat of a strike set in motion a series of events that caused real fear, uncertainty and disruption for thousands of Nova Scotians. Capital Health responded to the threat of a strike by cancelling hundreds of surgeries and appointments. Capital Health postponed 530 diagnostic imaging appointments, 430 surgeries, and 1,947 outpatient appointments.</p>
<p>Now I remind members that these are not simply numbers, there are people who are attached to those numbers, people like Lisa Morehouse. She is a single mother raising a young child and she had cancer. Just as her treatments were about to start, they were postponed because of that threat, just the threat, there was no strike, just the threat. Those numbers also represent people like Mac and Marjorie Fiander.</p>
<p>Last Spring, because of the threat of a strike, Marjorie's surgery was cancelled overnight - outright. At the time Mr. Fiander wrote to the Premier saying that cancer doesn't wait for anybody, which is absolutely true, and that the cancellation was totally unacceptable. Few people can argue with him. Cancer does not wait. With full knowledge that the very threat of a strike would cause undue stress for thousands of Nova Scotians, some who were very ill, this government let hospitals ramp down. The Liberals look at it the other way, they actually said nothing and I know the government, when they get up to speak, probably will take a couple of shots at the Liberals as well.</p>
<p>This legislation will ensure government, no matter what political stripe, would put patients first. It ensures hospitals will stay open, that not another surgery would ever be cancelled, that no important test would be postponed because of a contract dispute. As terrible as the threat of a strike was, an actual strike would have been much, much worse. At the time the Capital District Health Authority said the system could only withstand a strike for a matter of days. The quote from Barbara Hall, who is the health authority's vice-president of person-centred care said, "The pent-up demand for all the other things in the community, for the elective surgeries that would be cancelled, that pressure will get larger and larger." I can also quote her as saying, "We don't feel that we could endure, with emergency staffing, a very long strike." I'll table that, it's an article from CBC News, April 11, 2012, so just about a year ago today.</p>
<p>Again, members should take a moment to think about what it would mean. How many Lisa Morehouses and Marjorie Fianders would there be? What would it say about our province if Nova Scotians couldn't count on getting the treatment that they need because of a labour dispute?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I am very interested to hear from the other two Parties, to hear if they stand with the patients or, of course, stand against them. As we've said before, this is not about the collective bargaining process, it's about making it better for patients and making it better for the health care workers who provide that service for us. They are an incredible group of people who work very hard for us, as well, and all we can say is that one cancelled surgery, one cancelled program because of the threat of a strike, is far, far too many, and that's what this bill aims to stop.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak today and I look forward to comments from my colleagues.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#20520cce-c7eb-4da6-bc5e-8e9f24f3db6b"><from>MR. JIM BOUDREAU</from><p>I'm very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill No. 35, the Trade Union Act. Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, conservative politicians have attacked workers' rights. The members opposite oppose minimum wage increases, and previous Progressive Conservative Governments attacked nurses and health care workers with Bill No. 68 and later Bill No. 1.</p>
<p>I want to quote the Leader of the Third Party. He says, "It's a mystery to me how the NDP make their decisions. That's something they'll have to account for." I'll table that, but I'd like to remind the honourable members that this NDP Government makes decisions based upon logic, reason, common sense, and what is good for the common person and the common good.</p>
<p>Perhaps the members opposite might like to visit the statue of Joseph Howe on these grounds, and perhaps look at what Joseph Howe had to say. It's interesting that I heard quite a bit of reference to the fact that this bill is not about politics. I beg to differ, Madam Speaker. This bill is all about politics. The history of the Progressive Conservative Party in this province is very clear. It's crystal clear. (Interruptions) I'm not going to listen to some of the sanctimonious comments over there. The reality is that we will be judged not on what we say but on what we do.</p>
<p>Bill No. 68 was introduced by the Progressive Conservative Government in 2001, and many of us standing here in this House remember that bill very well. I suspect that the honourable Minister of Health and Wellness would remember that bill very well. This bill was opposed in the House. The health care workers were angry, and even the government of the time - the Progressive Conservatives, the Tories - said that the binding arbitration they imposed was not affordable.</p>
<p>It's interesting that in the days after the bill passed - the one that they're talking about again today, so to speak - they did not impose a contract. "Instead, the Tories agreed to a form of binding arbitration, something they said the province couldn't afford" - and lo and behold, the province couldn't afford it. "Registered nurses wound up with an 18 per cent raise compounded over three years. Licensed practical nurses and other health care workers got just 7.7 per cent plus a $1,500 lump-sum payment."</p>
<p>It's interesting that this group of people will bring this back again and try to revisit this when it has been rejected a number of times on this Legislature floor and it has been rejected by the public, but again, because of clear ideology they will bring this back. When I table some other documents you'll understand the fact that they don't have a plan, and I'll table this one.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Progressive Conservative Government, as I was stating, didn't learn anything from the criticism they received on Bill No. 68, because just a few years later they introduced Bill No. 1, which again aimed to take away health care workers' rights. Bill No. 1 - it's right here in the Canadian Press: basically what happened here, this controversial bill, which was aimed at preventing strikes in the Nova Scotia health care sector - what happened was the government itself filibustered its own bill, convinced that they wouldn't get a chance to vote on it. So, this group, or this Party over there, brought that in twice; the second time they filibustered and killed their own bill. Great. That shows that you're in control, and that you have a good idea of where you're going, and you have a plan. That's a really good plan. I would suspect that that would work very well.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, today this bill attempts to continue the discussion around some of what are the most important workers in our province. Everyone knows just how significant workers in the health care profession and in community services professions are. The significance of these workers is not what is being debated today, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>Again, we want to focus on what is being said today and what was done in the past and what was said is something that they don't believe in. They don't believe in it, they just put it out here as a way of trying to convince Nova Scotians that they have a plan, that they have a purpose. Okay - no plan, no vision. So, while the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Party over there are busy fear mongering, okay, fear mongering, perhaps the rest of us, here will have a reasonable debate about this piece of legislation.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that arbitration may be an option. That does not mean the rights of workers should be stripped away. Taking rights from health care workers is a sure way to worsen health care shortages. Those workers are apt to leave and move somewhere with more desirable working conditions. The proposed piece of legislation means that bargaining decisions would be made by an arbiter, and as a union member and someone who has done some negotiations, I'm very clear, and I clearly understand what that means.</p>
<p>While arbiters can play an important role in the collective bargaining process, we need to understand the risks at stake with arbitration. Madam Speaker, I'm not surprised to hear this from the member opposite. It is his very Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, that let spending get so far out of control that our province's finances were in shambles. It was the previous government that allowed wage increases for health care workers to jump 2.9 percent year after year, a right that was not sustainable. It was the previous government that watched some wage increases jump as high as 5 per cent each year. And I'd like to table this document which indicates that an arbitration panel has awarded workers of more than a hundred different health care jobs in the Capital district, raises that could top 15 per cent. So, that's what arbitration can do to you, Madam Speaker, if it's not dealt with in a responsible way.</p>
<p>I obviously believe in fiscal responsibility and restraint, especially in difficult times. This government understands that, and that's why we're doing what we're doing. Now, through careful and diligent negotiations, this government was able to come to a wage increase agreement of 1 per cent a year. Negotiations work. How much time? One minute.</p>
<p>Okay. I'm going to use the phrase that the opposite side doesn't like to hear. We're turning a corner in this province; we're not chasing our tails. We're not chasing our tails. Now, Madam Speaker, I could stand up here and continue to make this a political debate, or a financial discussion, but Madam Speaker, every member of this House knows that this piece of legislation puts patient safety at risk and truly shows that the Tory Party is a collection of yesterday's men who have no vision and are fixated on the failings of the past. It is therefore not something that our government is prepared to support. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm happy to stand and discuss this Progressive Conservative bill that has come forward. The Liberal caucus will be unequivocally opposing this bill. We see it as an attack on the collective bargaining process, and we don't think that is what this province needs right now. This will be a position that we do share with the government, that collective bargaining is a fundamental process by which employers and employees are able to reach contracts together. There's a balance of power within that relationship that the collective bargaining process keeps and ensures that the outcome is fair, and hopefully fair to both parties.</p>
<p>We see this bill as an attack fundamentally on that process and its fairness and its ability to produce a fair result, for both employers and employees. We see this as a bill that is driven primarily by the far-right ideology of the Third Party. (Interruptions) Well before the members of the government congratulate me too much, they might want to hear the rest of my comments.</p>
<p>A problem that we've seen in this Legislature that I think has been highlighted in the debates that we've had over the course of the last number of years, is the issue and the problem that ideological positions cause when we're tackling collective bargaining. We've seen the government take a very ideological stance on the other side of the political spectrum with first contract arbitration in its most severe form that we've seen in the province.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party did provide some amendments to that first contract arbitration legislation to make it what we felt would be more appropriate and fair to the collective bargaining process. We weren't shouting from on high like the Third Party was, that first contract arbitration would be the end of our economy or anything like that, but there were some issues in that piece of legislation that we thought should be addressed. Employers from across the province had concerns with it, small businesses had concerns with it and that is why we did filibuster that piece of legislation and try to make amendments to it to make it more friendly to the employer side as they had concerns with it.</p>
<p>This is the problem when you approach this issue from an ideological perspective; on the right you have the Progressive Conservatives treating employees as a problem and presenting ideas that would make the collective bargaining process unfair to employees and taking away their ability to strike. If you look at the suggestion that the Progressive Conservatives were making, this bill, if passed, would mean, step one, there would be mediation, step two would mean arbitration, step three would mean decision of arbitration binding and that is not collective bargaining and we don't think it's fair.</p>
<p>On the other side, on the left hand side of this Legislature, we've seen the NDP treat employers as a problem, and I don't think that is fair as well. First contract arbitration, in the form it was presented, did cause a lot of concern with employers and their concerns were ignored by this government. That is why I think, especially when you're dealing with procedural issues like this, you need to keep ideology out of it and just look at the issue from a procedural standpoint and assure that the process is in place which will allow the fairest outcome for all involved. That is why this Party has continuously taken a compromise position when it comes to these issues in the Legislature, reaching for compromise between labour and employers.</p>
<p>That said, employees and their unions do have a responsibility to put forward fair requests when it comes to the needs of their employees, as employers have a responsibility to ensure that what they're giving their employees is fair and that everything is reflective of what each can accommodate and what each can provide and what each can give up in some circumstances. Having a collective bargaining process that allows those two sides to work out those issues amongst themselves is the only way to ensure that the outcome is going to be fair to both sides.</p>
<p>If you go forward with the Progressive Conservative way, employees lose the right to strike. I know that labour disruptions can be challenging for some to accept but they're a necessary part of the collective bargaining process. Labour disruptions happen, they'll continue to happen, and sometimes they should happen to ensure that employees are able to get what they need and what they deserve from employers, to ensure the outcome is fair for them.</p>
<p>On the other side, forcing a first contract arbitration on employers can potentially shift the balance of power the other way and allow employees to, perhaps, at certain moments - and we're not saying this is going to happen - but it does shift the balance of power to allow employees, we think, to ask for a bit more than the market, or their employer, could sometimes provide. That's why it's fundamental that we all stick to the principles of the collective bargaining process and ensure that both sides are able to work these issues out fairly. That will include, sometimes, out of necessity, labour disruptions, either lockouts or strikes, and that's okay. That's part of what our democracy is about. That's what having a fair relationship between employees and employers is about and that's what this caucus will continue to support - a fair collective bargaining process where the balance of power is in the middle, where neither side has an advantage over the other and where each side is able to use the tools in their employ to ensure their position is properly reflected, throughout that process.</p>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#250f8b2e-9af9-4ca7-9778-41b96426667e"><from>MR. KEITH BAIN</from><p>I'm pleased to stand in my place this afternoon to speak to Bill No. 35, the Trade Union Act, an Act to Protect Patients and Provide for the Fair Resolution of Contract Negotiations in Health Care and Community Services.</p>
<p>This legislation contemplates what effect a health care strike, or the threat of a health care strike, would have on Nova Scotians. We are talking about Nova Scotians at some of the most vulnerable times in their lives, people who are anxious and worried because they have a health issue. That is when the health care system should be there. It should be there when people need it.</p>
<p>Entry into our excellent Nova Scotia health care system should ease the stress on Nova Scotians, and most of the time it does, but we learned last Spring that even the threat of a strike turns the system upside down. Not knowing if the system will help you when you need it, or knowing that the help you need has been cancelled or postponed due to a labour disruption, is not acceptable to someone who is scared, someone with nowhere else to turn.</p>
<p>In preparation for a walkout, 530 diagnostic imaging appointments had to be postponed and about 430 surgeries, on top of the nearly 2,000 out-patient appointments, had been delayed. Of that, about 5 per cent of the postponed surgeries were cancer-related; 172 hospital beds were closed and there was an 80-85 per cent reduction in lab testing. It also stated that, if a strike had taken place, 130 operations would be postponed, every day, during the strike.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this bill strikes the right balance between ensuring patients' access to care, respecting the negotiating process and protecting the taxpayer. It ensures that important health services remain operating during collective bargaining and any ensuing unresolved disputes. It provides an alternative dispute resolution process so that work stoppages or even the threat of work stoppages cannot cause health service interruptions because health care should be there when people need it.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this legislation is modelled on legislation in other provinces that has been found to be constitutional and respects the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including the freedom of association. It allows the bargaining parties to work out a method of final dispute resolution. This bill leaves the door open on what type of arbitration is ultimately chosen, therefore allowing government and management to work with union leadership on the method that is most fair. It contains a provision that requires an arbitrator to consider the state of Nova Scotia's finances when determining a settlement, alongside other considerations such as comparable rates of pay and benefits in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the member for Yarmouth has said that this legislation is far-right ideology, so this begs the question of whether he and his Party consider health care being there when people need it is far-right ideology.</p>
<p>You know, Mr. Speaker, last Spring even the NSGEU president admitted that the threat of labour interruption was disruptive. She said, "&#x2026; the possibility of the strike has created chaos in the workplace &#x2026;" I will table that.</p>
<p>No one who needs a test or delicate operation wants to hear that there's chaos in the very place they are going for help. No one worried about a parent or a sibling or a child who is sick, wants to learn that the people who are supposed to treat them are working in a chaotic workplace because health care should be there when people need it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this bill means that health care workers will not have to feel that their workplace is in chaos. It means that Nova Scotians will have complete confidence that they will get the care they need even if labour negotiations are taking place. Today, with this bill, we will see who puts patients first and who does not, because health care should be there when people need it.</p>
<p>Last Spring, Mr. Speaker, the then Health Minister stood on the sideline and watched as the threat of a labour stoppage struck fear in the hearts of Lisa Morehouse and Marjorie Fiander and their families. Standing beside the minister was the Liberal Leader. He decided to watch to see what happened before he took a stand. He told the media he, "supports collective bargaining and wants to see the sides settle their issues at the table." I will table that. With all due respect, that's what everybody wants.</p>
<p>The real question for the Liberals and the NDP is who wants to bring chaos to hospital workplaces and turmoil to sick Nova Scotians while the collective bargaining process goes on because health care should be there when people need it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to say that my Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, stands with patients and this bill means that the patients will always come because health care should be there when people need it. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <heading>EI SYSTEM: OMNIBUS CHANGES - CONDEMN</heading>
          <speech by="#ce90163b-7a3b-4884-b7d9-b5ca06af4cc3"><from>MR. GARY BURRILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I rise in the place of the people of Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley to speak to a matter that is having a serious impact and negative impacts on the communities and the well-being of the people of our province, namely the changes in the Employment Insurance system being introduced by the Government of Canada. I wish to draw attention this evening to two of these changes in particular, the new more restrictive EI eligibility rules for the seasonally unemployed, and the abolition of the Board of Referees EI appeal system.</p>
<p>First, as of January 6<sup>th</sup>, new regulations have come into force for anyone who has filed for EI three times or more in the last five years. People in this newly formed category are now required from the first day of their EI claim to accept employment that pays them 80 per cent of their previous earnings, and people in this same category, after six weeks, now are newly required to accept a job at 70 per cent of their previous earnings - and such employment can be anywhere within a 100-kilometre radius of a person's home. Now those most profoundly affected by these very significant changes in the EI system are employees, of course, in seasonal industries, those industries which are the complete backbone of the natural resource-based economy of rural Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>
<p>Premier Dexter was absolutely right when he said that these changes reflect an astounding failure to comprehend the economic realities of rural life - people who work, for example, in the woods and who are typically, each year, laid off when the roads close. When that happens they don't fail to go down to Walmart and apply for jobs as Walmart greeters because somehow they are people that need a little bit of extra prodding - they don't do that because they know that two hours after the roads reopen they are going to be needed in their normal, regular jobs. From an employer's point of view seasonal businesses of all sorts from limestone quarries to the Christmas tree business, to landscaping, all sorts of seasonal industries are highly dependent, it is in the fabric of their business model that they're dependent upon a trained and experienced workforce being available for recall following cyclical seasonal downturns, and this is precisely what is provided by EI.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Harper has said that the purpose of these changes is to encourage more flexibility - "encourage" here, however, is exactly the wrong word here. The accurate word, the right word to describe what is taking place here, would be words like "force" or "pressure" or "make." The real import of these changes is to pressure, to force, to make people accept lower-wage employment than they would otherwise, thereby depressing wages overall and creating an ever-more-transient workforce, which are the real goals of the Harperist economic program.</p>
<p>Two: under the same omnibus legislation which brought about these changes in seasonal EI, the board of referees system of EI appeals has been abolished. Until now, if anyone wished to appeal a decision affecting their eligibility to benefits in EI, they could do so by applying to appeal before the local board of referees. This was a simple system in its composition. The boards all across the country consisted of three appointees: one who was appointed by a local board of trade or chamber of commerce to represent the business community; one who was normally appointed from a trade union, representing the labour movement; and a third who was a government appointee.</p>
<p>These board members were independent, operating simply on per diems while they did board of referees work. They were not - and this is significant - employees of the EI Commission. Their hearings were held - as any MLA who has represented a constituent in that setting knows - in more-or-less informal settings around a table. In other words, settings in which one would be able to demonstrate what is often the critical factor in EI eligibility decisions, and that is the credibility, the character, and the authenticity of the person who is making their argument about the case, which is something that cannot be established in any way better than it can be established around a table, face to face, eyeball to eyeball with another person.</p>
<p>All of that, 100 per cent of that system, which has operated so democratically and made so many opportunities for people to have wrongful bureaucratic decisions reversed and their benefits reinstated - all of that is gone now. It is gone with the current replacement of every board of referees in Canada with a new thing called a Social Security Tribunal, which is composed of full-time, government-employed, almost all Ottawa-based tribunal members, who will now hear submissions, we are grateful to know, via written submissions - and even, in exceptional cases, we are so gratified to know, via teleconference. In my judgment, it is no accident that the loss of a local, face-to-face voice in the appeals process is exactly coinciding with new rules which stand to intensify the number of people who are being cut off from their EI.</p>
<p>Therefore, this evening I am issuing a challenge to Scott Armstrong, the Member of Parliament for Cumberland-Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, and the federal government's chief apologist on these issues to the people both he and I represent. This is a challenge to Mr. Armstrong to debate me publicly on the subject of the EI changes. (Applause) I challenge Mr. Armstrong to debate me publicly about the EI changes at any place of his choosing. I challenge him to debate me before the people we both represent at any time of his choosing. I challenge him to debate me before the people we both represent on the subject of these nefarious EI changes in any format which he would select - any place, any time, any format, and in any forum which Mr. Armstrong might select. I issue, this evening, this challenge on this very important subject, Mr. Speaker, because I believe that the authors of this egregious unfairness should be called to answer for the harm they're inflicting on our people. Thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I am actually a bit shy to get up, after such a great performance. The member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley articulated the concerns of a lot of Nova Scotians very well, I think, on this issue and always presents a primarily unpolitical viewpoint on a lot of the issues that we deal with in this House. I want to thank that member for his comments.</p>
<p>Coming from a rural area in Yarmouth, a large part of our economy is based on seasonal industries, fishing, our lobster fishery and our other fisheries are the backbones of our community, and herring fishing as well. All along the South Shore and around the Bay of Fundy, that is the economic backbone of our area. It is a dwindling industry, Mr. Speaker, primarily because of the decisions this government made around the Yarmouth ferry, but our tourism industry is still important to our local economy, our tourism infrastructure is important, as well as forestry. We have a lot of woodcutters and folks involved in the forestry industry, which are all, because of no fault of the employees or the industries themselves, seasonal industries.</p>
<p>I think that the federal changes to EI that they have been pushing through the House of Commons, is a direct attack on those industries and will result in a damaging effect on the economy of Yarmouth, the economy of Shelburne, the economies of Clare, Argyle and really the economy of any region of Nova Scotia, which would be most of our rural areas, that needs a strong, seasonal component in their region.</p>
<p>Risks that we have here are: further out-migration from this province; further out-migration from rural Nova Scotia into either urban centres or out West, because most of these individuals who are working in seasonal employment, whether it is in the fisheries, forestry, tourism, a lot of these folks are involved in labour, and if their skills are not being used in our local communities, they are going to take those skills elsewhere and go out West. We have seen that happen over the course of the last decade.</p>
<p>We have had a problem, as a province, stemming that out-migration of individuals, despite all the boasting from government that they have stopped it and there are going to be all kinds of opportunities to come home, stats still show that a lot of our people are going out West because there's not work here. If you have this attack on the EI system continue, you'll have a lot more people who cannot work in these seasonal industries and they will go out West.</p>
<p>I know for many it was very upsetting to hear the federal Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, the minister who I worked under, not politically but in the federal Civil Service, it was upsetting to myself and to many Nova Scotians when she said, well, we just want people to work. Everybody wants to work, Mr. Speaker, and I think it speaks to a flawed assumption from the federal Conservatives around EI that it's being used and that Nova Scotians are gouging the system to simply live off the taxpayers' dime. I know that for any of us MLAs in rural areas, we know that's not the case. There are obviously some people who abuse the system - there will always be a small number of people who abuse any system if given the chance - but as we know, the majority of individuals using EI are using it to supplement their income because they're seasonal employees or they're transitioning into other fields of work.</p>
<p>So to have a minister stand up at a time when the economies of Atlantic Canada are, I would say, a bit recessed, and say, we just want people to go find work, you can find work, get out there and find it - I think that was very insensitive and was not reflective of the realities that our economy currently provides to those workers.</p>
<p>I have spoken with a lot of workers who are employed in our fish plants. They have worked there, some of them, for upward of 30 to 40 years. They're very hard workers, they're diligent workers, and they're very good at what they do, but because their career has been based in that one industry, which is seasonal, they have not acquired the necessary skills or education to perhaps go and seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>Plus, we do not have jobs in rural Nova Scotia right now. Rural Nova Scotia is going through a very difficult time, as we all know, and I hope we all recognize, including the government. There's not a plethora or huge deposit of jobs out there waiting for these people, so you have a lot of individuals who are very stressed right now. They're wondering if they will be able to continue living in our home rural communities with their families and continuing the work that they can do, if they're not able to supplement that work with employment insurance.</p>
<p>The same goes for our fisheries. There are a lot of people who make a lot of money by fishing. There are a lot of folks out there on the boats who do not make a lot of money. They get whatever percentage that they're allocated from the captain from the catch, and they are just making ends meet, but they are able to stay here and they're able to contribute to our local economies and put that money back into our communities because of the current EI system that's in place.</p>
<p>As legislators, I think it's very important that we challenge that fundamental assumption. The employment insurance system isn't a system that is just allowing people to be lazy or maintain ignorance or anything like that. It's a system that is upholding key parts of our economy in seasonal employment. I think it's up to all of us, including members of the Third Party, to challenge that assumption that the federal government has been putting forward on this.</p>
<p>I especially look at what we're going through in Yarmouth, and it's very worrisome to know what these changes to employment insurance are going to result in. We are already a community that is extremely stressed with a lack of jobs, with a tourism sector that has been dwindling without our access to our key tourism market in New England. We have a fishing industry that has been dealing with, at certain points in the season, very low prices or very low catches. People are telling me already that this is not worth it - this is not worth it, we're going to pack up, we're going to go out West like everybody else, because we're not able to do this work anymore.</p>
<p>It's interesting, especially when you look at the fishery, that there are other federal policies that are impacting independent fishers. The quota system does not allow them to go out and fish outside the season that's given to them, especially with the small hook-and-line fishermen. So you have this federal policy which is impacting our independent fisheries, the hook-and-line fishers, who cannot catch as much fish as they should be able to catch, even though it's out there, and who cannot make the livelihood out of that industry that they used to because of that quota system. Now we have another federal policy coming down the pipe that's going to impact the other part of their income, which is the employment insurance part of it.</p>
<p>Forestry and tourism are essential parts of our economy. Seasonal employment, right now, is absolutely critical to the economy of Yarmouth, Shelburne, Clare, Cape Breton - everywhere - because it's what's keeping our communities alive right now and it's absolutely, I think, vital that collectively all three Parties in this Legislature start standing up to these changes a bit more. I know the Liberals have, the NDP have too, to their credit, and we'd like to have the Third Party stand with us in opposing these changes and protect our communities from what could be a very damaging result. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>Whereas until this season the Avonview Avalanche had not fielded a baseball team for competition since 2004; and</p>

            <p>The honourable member for Cape Breton West.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I live in and represent an area that has 18.5 per cent unemployment - much like yourself - in an area that has a lot of seasonal workers, and like all members of this House of Assembly, our caucus has concerns about the EI changes and the potential impact on Nova Scotians and Cape Bretoners. But unlike the other members of this House, the members of this caucus will continue to bring our concerns and our views forward in a constructive manner. (Interruptions)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's fine if the members opposite want to make light of this situation, but I know it wasn't the intention of the honourable member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley when he brought this issue forward. It certainly wasn't the issue for the member for Yarmouth, but if the members on that side of the House decide that that's where they want to go then shame on them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, our Leader and our members will continue to meet with concerned Nova Scotians and we won't stop standing up for their rights. Just after the crisis in Bay St. Lawrence, the Leader of our Party, the member for Victoria-The Lakes, and myself went to Bay St. Lawrence, went in a hall with 78 individuals who were concerned about their challenges with the EI system, and we listened and we talked and we got informed of the challenges that they were facing. But it didn't end there, it didn't stop there because when we left we went and we made phone calls and contacted individuals, and as a result of that, over 90 per cent of the cases were solved in the Bay St. Lawrence area. That speaks volumes about our commitment to helping people with the changes there in EI.</p>
<p>On top of that, Mr. Speaker, our caucus took it upon ourselves to get a meeting with the federal Conservative MPs in the Province of Nova Scotia and sat across the table from them and expressed the concerns of our constituents, who we represent, about the changes in EI. We didn't stand in the House and wail, we actually went and delivered the message to the people that could bring it back to the table where the decisions are being made; that's what we did.</p>
<p>We also, each one of our members, met with constituents, listened to their concerns and made sure that we brought those concerns to other areas. We took the time to sit down with the people at Service Canada, the members from Cape Breton, and we asked the Service Canada people to explain, to give the real facts as to their understanding of what was going on with the changes - not something that we read in a newspaper article, not something that we heard from a group of people that wanted to create havoc; we went to the source to hear and try to understand the changes that were being made.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we sat down with people who are in small seasonal industries, people who have seasonal employees working for them, and found out from them the challenges it was creating for them as employers, and for the people they employed. That's what is proactive, that's the way you find out the real story, and that is what we did.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we met with and we've heard from individuals. The member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley brought up a very important point, when he talked about the changes to the appeal system. That has us very concerned; it has us very concerned. So we have brought those concerns forward. The changes to the appeal process are an area of concern that we will continue to speak out about.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate effects of the changes has been the degree to which the NDP, and some Liberals, have been willing to spread rumours. People hear and read fear-mongering, and they react. But when we check the facts, we find out that much of what gets said, particularly by the federal Liberal MPs, is an exaggeration of the facts. (Interruption) Mr. Speaker, if that member has a lot to say, then I'm sure she would be welcome to speak at any time, if she gets permission from the Premier's Office.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, scaring people, like she likes to do, just isn't responsible. One of the things that is true is that the EI changes now pale in comparison to the great cuts to EI which were inflicted by the federal Liberals. The last time the Liberals got a chance, they carved deeply into EI, and many members remember that. I would hope that all members are prepared to condemn the deep cuts that the Liberals made to the EI system. Thank you very much.</p></speech>
