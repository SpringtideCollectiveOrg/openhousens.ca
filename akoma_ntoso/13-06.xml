      <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>MR. SPEAKER</from><p>Before we start the daily routine today, the subject matter for late debate has been chosen and is:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that this House of Assembly take the time to mark December 6, 2013, as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p>
<p>It was submitted by the honourable member for Fairview-Clayton Park.</p>
<p>Also, before I start the daily routine, I'll give my ruling on the point of order raised yesterday.</p>
<p><b>SPEAKER'S RULING: </b>Government backbencher should not be permitted to ask a question in Question Period (Pt. of order by Hon. F. Corbett [Hansard, p.244, Dec. 3/13)] Limited use of questions by government backbenchers will be permitted.</p>
<p>Yesterday the honourable member for Waverley-Fall River-Beaver Bank asked a question of the honourable Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal during Question Period. Following Question Period, the honourable House Leader for the New Democratic Party rose on a point of order, and it was his position that the tradition of the House was that Question Period was reserved for Opposition Parties and any independent members.</p>
<p>The point of order was supported by the honourable House Leader for the Official Opposition, who added that he believed this issue should be part of a general review by the Committee on Assembly Matters.</p>
<p>In considering this matter, I looked first at our rules. Rule 31 does not limit the putting of questions to ministers only to members of the Opposition Parties. Other provisions in our rules that are limited to Opposition business clearly state such a limited application.</p>
<p>The leading authority on parliamentary procedure in the House of Commons, O'Brien and Bosc, make it clear that while Question Period is designed primarily to allow the Opposition members to hold government to account, it is still possible for members from the caucus of the Government Party to also ask questions.</p>
<p>It says at Page 492: "Any Member can ask a question, although the time is set aside almost exclusively for the opposition parties to confront the government and hold it accountable for its actions, and to highlight the perceived inadequacies of the government."</p>
<p>Note that the quotation says that the time is set aside "almost exclusively for the opposition" - it does not say "exclusively."</p>
<p>This left me wondering how this issue is dealt with in other jurisdictions, provinces, and territories. The Chief Clerk has researched this and has advised me that in all the other provinces and territories in Canada that have Party politics in their government systems, the right of backbench non-Cabinet members of the government caucus to ask some questions to ministers is recognized to some degree.</p>
<p>While there is some variation on how this is carried out across jurisdictions, the general principles are that a limited amount of time is set aside for questions from government backbenchers, usually later in Question Period, after ample time has been given to the Official Opposition, other Parties, and other independent members. In some provinces a turn for a government backbench question is reserved late in the Question Period rotation for the day; in other jurisdictions the right to ask questions is acknowledged but rarely taken advantage of.</p>
<p>The honourable Government House Leader has advised me and the other House Leaders that it is his intent to only have the 10<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> questions in each Question Period asked by non-Cabinet members of his Party's caucus, and that in each case only one question will be asked - there will be no supplementary questions.</p>
<p>Given these intended parameters and the principles of parliamentary procedure I have mentioned previously, I am satisfied that permitting such limited use of the time of Question Period is reasonable so long as the primary use of the time by the Opposition is respected - by this I mean that both the question and the answer should be concise.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the questions will be about matters of genuine interest to the particular members posing them. I believe it would be unfortunate if the questions were simply easy plants designed to allow ministers opportunities to make statements that they are already free to make under the order of business, Statements by Ministers. This has been a concern in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>I believe this ruling is consistent with a recent significant ruling by Speaker Scheer in our House of Commons. On April 23<sup>rd</sup> of this year, Speaker Scheer addressed the question of the individual rights of members to freedom of speech, against the backdrop of the conventions of Party control and use of lists submitted by Party Whips that dictated the order of members being given the floor to speak. No matter what, it's always up to the Speaker to decide who is recognized to speak, and I will safeguard the interests of all members on both sides of the House.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while I thank both the House Leaders of the NDP and the Official Opposition for raising the point of order, it should come as no surprise, given what I have just said, that I must find to the contrary, and advise the House that I will permit the limited use of questions by government backbenchers in the manner proposed by the honourable Government House Leader.</p>
<p>If problems arise I can always revisit the question of this new practice. Also, it is open to the House to come to a more formal recognition of the rights of members to pose questions in any revision to our rules. Thank you for your attention.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Cape Breton Centre.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to take the opportunity to reiterate, as I have done with the two Opposition House Leaders, that under the instructions of our Premier, it is expected that we will have a full review of numerous matters that relate to the Legislature in the hopes of modernizing our rules, ensuring fairness on all sides, and most importantly, accountability to Nova Scotians. I do suspect that we will be coming forward together with more changes to be brought to the Legislature in the weeks and months ahead. Merci.</p>

          <speech by="#8b070bb9-483e-4dec-90fa-9496ca56f8a9"><from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in this House to deliver this government's 2013-14 budget.</p>
<p><b>Back to Balance</b></p>
<p>It is a budget that fulfills the government's commitment to bring Nova Scotia's finances back to balance. Because of that fact, this budget will be scrutinized more closely than others in recent memory. It will be scrutinized closely precisely because it represents a new way of doing things. Too often we have seen governments declare budgets balanced, only to realize, after the voters had their say, that the budget was not really balanced at all. Or that the choices made to show this temporary result were not sustainable or realistic ones.</p>
<p>It is in that context that I am very proud to say the revenue forecasts contained in the 2013-14 budget have received an unqualified opinion from the Office of the Auditor General - something no Nova Scotian government has achieved in more than a decade. (Applause)</p>
<p>Clearly we are on track. But for Nova Scotia to keep living within its means, the province and our government must continue the steps taken over the past four years to reallocate spending to important front-line services and improvements. Government must continue to ensure spending decisions reflect common sense, the will of Nova Scotians, and remain focused on a better future.</p>
<p>Instead of being the province to turn in the worst economic performance in the country over the past 20 years, Nova Scotia's economy is now starting to turn the corner toward a brighter future. Vital public services are secure and improving. Nova Scotians are going forward with greater confidence. We must not turn back.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's first NDP Government came to office during the worst global recession since the great depression, further constrained by a legacy from those who preceded us in government - a legacy of haphazard financial management and the absence of any well-considered plan to grow the economy.</p>
<p>Almost immediately upon taking office, Premier Dexter asked Deloitte to take a hard look at the province's finances. They found that without significant change, Nova Scotia had a projected deficit of $1.3 billion annually by 2012-13 and that net debt would rise from $12.3 billion in 2009-10 to $16.75 billion in 2012-13.</p>
<p>An independent expert panel of distinguished economists - Elizabeth Beale, Tim O'Neill, Lars Osberg, and Donald Savoie - advised us how to dig out of the financial mess we had inherited. They said:</p>
<blockquote>It is the panel's view that the government of Nova Scotia should pursue both tax increases and spending cuts and promote an economic growth agenda to deal with the province's deteriorating financial position. The government should not attempt to eliminate the deficit by 2010&#x2013;2011, but adopt a more gradual fiscal strategy to avoid slowing the economic recovery and destabilizing needed public services. </blockquote>
<p>Economic Advisors' Report November 2009, page 13</p>
<p>They told us that we couldn't get back to balance and turn the corner on 20 years of the slowest economic growth in Canada unless we had a comprehensive approach. They advised adopting an approach with three elements. We needed to increase revenue, reduce government spending, and grow the economy while protecting public services.</p>
<p>Previous governments have placed balanced budgets before this House. None, in recent years, has done so without unacceptable cuts to essential public services, as was the case in the 1990s, or the good fortune of revenue windfalls from the offshore as occurred in the last decade.</p>
<p>While ours is a government that prefers to look forward, the lessons of the recent past are important for Nova Scotians to recall. Many will remember the last Liberal Government - the government that responded to reduced federal transfers by imposing across-the-board cuts to all government departments and entities. They unilaterally broke negotiated contracts, closed hospital beds, laid off nurses, built toll highways, instituted user fees on vital health services, cut our children's provincial dental program, and took away inflation protection for the most vulnerable Nova Scotians. As a province, we continue to live with the outcomes of these hare-brained decisions to this very day.</p>
<p>More people will remember the recent Conservative Government, that undisciplined lot who pretended to be sound financial managers but overspent their budget by nearly $1 billion during their last 3 years in office. They produced budgets with half a billion dollars of spending increases with little to show for it. Instead of using that revenue to invest in people by helping permanently upgrade their skills, they purchased kiddie ATVs. Rather than supporting the diversification of one-industry towns across rural Nova Scotia, they squandered record offshore revenues in a failed attempt to buy their way back to power.</p>
<p>This government has worked hard not to repeat the mistakes of our predecessors, and they've certainly given us a lot to learn from. With the help of many, our government has brought Nova Scotia back to balance while maintaining and often improving services for families, businesses, and individuals. We balanced the budget while investing in the fundamentals of a modern, resilient, and globally competitive economy. We got back to balance and stayed true to our fundamental values: to respect the province's workers, to care for the most vulnerable, and to make life better and more affordable for today's families. (Applause)</p>
<p>In less than four years, Nova Scotia has changed direction, away from the looming billion dollar deficits and low-paying jobs left by the former government, away from the wage rollbacks and standing-room-only hospital waiting rooms left by the members of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, let's look at where we are today, how we got here, and most importantly where we are going. The budget is back in balance, and Nova Scotians are getting better care sooner; schools are putting kids and learning first; and good, high-paying jobs are coming here with more to follow. Students have access to post-secondary education and training at a predictable price and the support of a student aid program that is second to none in Canada. When they graduate, there are tax incentives to stay in Nova Scotia and take on the challenge of a widening spectrum of opportunity. This budget makes it more affordable for students in need to pursue the education and training they require to build a life in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>We are back to balance despite three years of modest revenue growth - not through hoping and wishing. We are back to balance because we asked the experts; developed a multi-year plan; and we stuck to that plan. We are back to balance because we recognized the collective wisdom of all Nova Scotians and their desire to get the province back on solid financial footing without compromising vital services.</p>
<p>In presenting the 2013-14 budget I feel a genuine sense of achievement, along with a sense of hope and optimism for our province. We are starting to turn the corner to a more prosperous future.</p>
<p><b>Better Care Sooner</b></p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there is no service, no program, and no support system that Canadians value more than public health care. In the last election, we heard loud and clear from Nova Scotians that they wanted better care, and they wanted it sooner.</p>
<p>My sincere thanks go to Dr. John Ross, a trusted adviser, who believed passionately that our health care system could be dramatically improved by the creation of Collaborative Emergency Centres. He listened to Nova Scotians, and the government listened, too. Today, Collaborative Emergency Centres are open around the clock in seven communities. Same-day or next-day medical appointments are now a phone call away for families who just a few years ago faced long drives and even longer waits. And soon the benefits of CECs will be available to more Nova Scotians in more communities.</p>
<p>Our commitment to providing better care sooner continues. Thanks in large measure to the work of the district health authorities who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the government as we curbed administration, and to physicians who delayed wage increases and health care workers who settled for a 1 per cent pay increase, Nova Scotia is turning the corner from the time when health care problems were deemed to be unsolvable and health care costs uncontrollable.</p>
<p>These leaders saw our financial pressures as a challenge to innovate and deliver better care; ensuring that patient care is protected while checking the increasing cost of health care is essential to getting health care on sustainable footing.</p>
<p>Funding has been allocated to advance major initiatives, including Together We Can, the Mental Health and Addictions strategy; Thrive!, a wellness strategy with special emphasis on children; and the Physicians Resource Plan.</p>
<p>This year, district health authorities and the IWK have been allocated operating budgets relatively equal to those of 2012-13. The government recognizes that this will present challenges, and the Department of Health and Wellness will work with DHAs and the IWK to finalize plans to manage their operations without an adverse effect on patients.</p>
<p>In the past, health budgets have been allowed to grow at an unsustainable pace. Despite those increases, there was no appreciable improvement in the health or wellness of Nova Scotians. While the cost of medical services continues to grow, the government is confident in the abilities and leadership of DHAs and the IWK to continue to find innovative ways to offer their full range of services.</p>
<p>It is at the core of our values as a government to take every step we can to support our youngest and most vulnerable citizens. In this budget, we are supporting a number of new initiatives that do just that.</p>
<p>Beginning this year, the province will offer improved support for children and young adults with Type 1 diabetes. I am very pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, that some of the new funding will be used to provide insulin pumps to individuals 19 years of age and younger, and supplies for insulin pumps to individuals under 25 years of age. The pumps will provide more stable management of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. (Applause)</p>
<p>This year we will also expand dental coverage for children - finally reversing the drastic cuts made to this program by the Liberals when they were in office. Starting in 2013-14, we are increasing the age for children to receive basic dental care for free, from 10 to 13. This is a significant improvement in health care coverage for children, and will make Nova Scotia's Oral Health Program one of the most accessible dental coverage programs in the country.</p>
<p>The budget includes the necessary funds to make a major expansion in newborn screening. The changes will extend screening to include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and eight additional conditions, with an investment of $1.3 million. Early detection can improve treatment and the quality of life for these children and their families.</p>
<p>Last year, the government completed Nova Scotia's first ever Mental Health and Addictions strategy, called Together We Can. In 2013-14, we will allocate an additional $2.5 million to begin the long-overdue implementation of quality health care for Nova Scotians suffering from mental health issues and addictions. To help children and adolescents get the services they need, $1.4 million has been budgeted to provide more mental health clinicians in schools. All Nova Scotians will have 24/7 access to mental health crisis intervention by calling the Mental Health Crisis Line.</p>
<p>The IWK is one of Canada's most respected hospitals for children and women. It is taking a new and better approach to helping children, youth, and their families access mental health care and addictions services. In the last two years, the IWK has been a leader in North America in implementing a new way to get children faster and more appropriate access to the care they need, when they need it.</p>
<p>This budget provides funding to build on this transition, and to help streamline services for families and children in need of mental health care.</p>
<p>Despite the IWK's leadership, there are areas where it has not had the ability to deliver services available in every other children's hospital in Canada, like programming for youth with eating disorders. Too often children and youth with serious eating disorders have had to be sent out of province to receive care. This budget sets that situation right, by providing funding to help the IWK and Capital District Health Authority design a joint Eating Disorders program: the first of its kind in Nova Scotia, and the kind of collaborative innovation that ensures our health care system continues to lead the way in Canada. (Applause)</p>
<p>To provide treatment closer to home for Nova Scotians with addictions, funding has been allocated that will allow 200 clients of the Mud Creek treatment facility in Wolfville to move to district health clinics in the Annapolis Valley, Colchester-East Hants, and the Capital District.</p>
<p>Since its election, this government has focused consistently on improving health care and other services to senior citizens. This year, the government is allocating $4.5 million to ensure that seniors will continue to pay less for generic drugs and will be protected against increases in Pharmacare premiums and co-payments.</p>
<p>Further investments in home-care program funding will help seniors acquire the community support they need to stay in their home. This includes help with transportation, meal preparation, errands, and yard work. This $2 million in increased funding will bring the government's two-year investment in home care to $24 million.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia will partner with other provinces to reduce the price of six common generic drugs used by many Nova Scotians, and will provide wheelchairs to eligible low-income seniors.</p>
<p><b>Kids and Learning First</b></p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, a solid education gives our children the confidence they need to be ready for the future. Mastering the basics in areas such as reading and math are fundamental skills all students need for the workforce of the future. In Nova Scotia we have an exceptional public education system filled with talented, committed teachers, parents and support staff. But we also have challenges: declining enrolment, costly infrastructure needs, weak test results, and growing costs have plagued the system for years.</p>
<p>Public education expert Dr. Ben Levin advised us how to capitalize on the strengths and opportunities within the system. In response to his report, the province developed a multi-year plan. Now in its second year, Kids and Learning First is improving the future success of our children through a greater focus on the early years, the basics, and safer, better schools. The plan means more teachers, increased support for special education, and smaller class sizes.</p>
<p>This government is also taking steps to ensure that schools maintain their place at the heart of our communities, with the benefit of the best advice Nova Scotians and those involved in community-building across the province have to offer.</p>
<p>This year the province will invest $10,762 per student - the highest investment in a generation. Class sizes for Primary to Grade 3 will remain capped at 25 students, providing the right learning environment to nurture our youngest students. These investments will mean that about 170 new teachers will be hired.</p>
<p>Adequate special education programming and qualified staff are the only way to ensure that students at risk and those with special needs receive the support they need to thrive. With the funding provided in this budget, 25 new program support staff, psychologists, and speech-language pathologists will be hired, and 15 new teacher assistants added. Additional resources will expand the ability of teachers to assess the developmental health of their students in critical areas like physical well-being, emotional maturity, social skills, and language.</p>
<p>To create a safer environment for students who are victims of bullying, Nova Scotia's first anti-bullying plan, Speak Up, will be put into action, with an initial allocation of $400,000 this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Mathematics has become a critical competency for many of the good jobs today and more of those that are coming in the future. To help students succeed in math, we are taking common-sense steps to improve the curriculum - like making math a full-year course in High School - and will soon bring forward a further set of changes for our youngest students.</p>
<p>This is not, Mr. Speaker, about a quick fix aimed at ensuring next year's math scores marginally exceed the last set of test scores. It's about setting these students up for life, with the right skills to succeed in the future. And we all recognize that a good grasp of math is essential to the future for every one of our students. That's why we are taking the right steps to change the way our students are taught math, changes that are long overdue, changes that will pay off for them all in the long run.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, the number of schools offering skilled trades will double and a new course, Manufacturing Trades 11, to help prepare students for upcoming shipbuilding jobs will be introduced. The highly successful Options and Opportunities initiative that helps young people consider career options will be available in Grade 9 through Discovering Opportunities. The number of students in rural areas and small communities who can take advantage of courses through the on-line virtual classroom will triple with an additional investment of $252,000.</p>
<p>Schools play a vital role in their communities, particularly in rural Nova Scotia where the school is often the focal point. To give children and their families more opportunities for after-school recreational, educational, and cultural programs, the Community Use of Schools Grant will again be available.</p>
<p>In addition, the SchoolsPlus program will be expanded to include four more schools, giving more families, students, and seniors the ability to access services and activities at central locations, as funding increases for this program by another $500,000 this year bringing our total investment to $2.5 million. (Applause)</p>
<p>New, better, and safer schools will be built in Amherst, New Glasgow, south Dartmouth, Bible Hill, Bedford, and Liverpool. More than $56 million will be invested in improvements to modernize schools in dozens of communities across the province. In the Halifax Regional School Board, funds will be invested to allow schools to save money and reduce greenhouse gases by 20 per cent.</p>
<p>The early years are critical years in establishing patterns that lead to a happy, healthy, successful life. In the coming year, the government will invest $1.2 million to establish children's centres so families can access support services for their young children and help them make a successful transition to elementary school.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, when this government was elected, Nova Scotia had one of the worst post-secondary student assistance programs in Canada. Today, we have one of the best, if not the best, and it is getting better. This year we are making further improvements in student aid where it is most needed - an improvement in the loan-to-grant ratio to 60/40, and an increase in the maximum weekly student allowance to $180. (Applause)</p>
<p>In addition to this investment of $4.6 million, the cost of post-secondary education to Nova Scotian students will be maintained at or below the national average. The government will continue to invest up to $25 million over three years in a post-secondary innovation fund. That funding is available to help universities collaborate and create efficiencies.</p>
<p>This year, the province is sponsoring an Innovation Summit, in an effort to commercialize university and college-based research and discoveries more quickly and to do it in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia needs to capitalize and exploit its best ideas for the benefit of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Making Life Better for Families</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this government and this Premier have a plan to make life better for families. And I'm sure all members will indulge me as I recall the many years the now-Premier and our caucus spent fighting on behalf of seniors and their families, so that they no longer had to pay the costs of medical expenses in long-term care. This was a long-needed change in how our province respects seniors, and ensures that they are treated with the dignity they so rightly deserve after years of building the society and economy of our province.</p>
<p>In the last four years we have taken even greater steps to help seniors. During the last two years, provincial income tax has been returned to seniors who receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement. In 2010 and 2011, seniors received over $15 million in refunds. In 2013-14, they will receive another $8 million. This rebate means that on average, $450 is put back into the hands of Nova Scotian seniors who need it most.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, that this budget builds further on that vital step forward to help seniors. As of January 1, 2014, we will increase the number of our low-income seniors who will no longer pay provincial income taxes; 25,000 Nova Scotia seniors will receive this benefit. (Applause)</p>
<p>In addition, this year the government will increase the maximum property tax rebate available to seniors by $200. This increase will help approximately 4,000 seniors to remain in their own homes and communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia's public housing policy was certainly well-intentioned, but it has unquestionably contributed to unanticipated and unwanted consequences, predominantly stigmatizing and marginalizing residents.</p>
<p>It is time for a fundamental change. In the year ahead, a new housing strategy for Nova Scotia will be launched. This strategy, with an initial investment of $3 million, will literally open doors for our most vulnerable citizens and make home ownership possible for families of modest income. (Applause) It will integrate low-income Nova Scotians in neighbourhoods and communities where they and their children have a better chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this government has from the beginning tried to find ways to help the most vulnerable members of our society. This year, we will increase the personal allowance rates for income assistance beneficiaries by a further 7 per cent. With this increase, personal use allowances have gone up by $47 a month - or 22 per cent - over the past four years. (Applause)</p>
<p>In difficult financial and economic times it can be a particular challenge but, Mr. Speaker - and I know you agree - it is incumbent upon us to take whatever steps we can to make life a little more affordable for those who need it most.</p>
<p>Often need is greatest in times of emergency and natural disasters. These situations require better planning than previous governments were willing to support. Beginning this year, the province will provide $3 million per year to work with vulnerable communities to better understand flooding and reduce the risk of damage.</p>
<p>This represents a new beginning in the partnership between the province, municipalities, first responders, and emergency relief agencies to ensure a greater level of preparation for, and protection from, natural disasters.</p>
<p>Secure Public Services</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, public services in Nova Scotia must be financially sustainable. Getting them there has required, and will continue to require, firm resolve.</p>
<p>District Health Authorities have demonstrated outstanding leadership in this area by reducing administrative and support services costs. We have already seen financial savings from their efforts and the reduction of administrative positions, including six VP positions. These savings can and will be redirected to front-line patient care.</p>
<p>We will take this approach from the health care sector and expand it across the public sector. Later this session we will bring forward the details of a new approach toward better-coordinated and merged services - an approach that will save Nova Scotians money and ensure continued strong delivery and support of our public services.</p>
<p>To quote my predecessor in this portfolio, the honourable member for Halifax Fairview, who deserves much credit for where we are today, "The decisions we make are rooted in common sense. While some will be tough, they will always be fair." (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, after the most extensive budget consultations in provincial history, the honourable member also said that the government's fiscal plan is built on the collective wisdom of Nova Scotians and reflects their values and priorities. The values and priorities of Nova Scotians continue to guide our every decision.</p>
<p>As the Premier recently said, economic prosperity is vital to Nova Scotia's future. But this government understands that its real value, the reason it really matters, lies in the fact that it provides the capacity to propel social prosperity and make life better for all Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>During these recessionary years, this government has walked a fine line. We had to spend judiciously as well as strategically, and be very mindful of not contributing to a deepening or more prolonged downturn. That's why we invested, along with our federal and municipal partners, in key infrastructure projects like roads and the new Nova Centre, that have kept skilled workers on the job and here at home.</p>
<p>When we began this journey, Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia was on an unsustainable path to a $1.3 billion deficit. Over the past four years, government has realigned, reorganized, and modernized.</p>
<p>Departmental spending grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent between fiscal 2000-01 and fiscal 2009-10. Over the last four years the average annual growth in spending has been held to 0.9 per cent and there will be a 1.6 per cent decline in fiscal 2013-14. (Applause)</p>
<p>In spite of very challenging economic circumstances, I'm proud that our government has been able to balance the budget while balancing the needs of families and small businesses, the needs of students and seniors, and the needs of patients and taxpayers.</p>
<p>We have improved access to health care while slowing its increasing cost. Since we took office the health care budget has grown by about 3 per cent annually, compared to an average of 7 per cent a year over the previous decade.</p>
<p>School boards rolled up their sleeves, too, and tackled their own budgets to better reflect the reality of declining enrolment. And universities worked with us to gain control over ballooning costs, with an eye to providing high-quality, first-rate education.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, introducing a balanced budget is a turning point for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>We are on a stronger financial foundation than we were four years ago, and we are balanced earlier than many other jurisdictions in Canada. Our debt-to-GDP ratio - a key measure of economic health - is close to 35 per cent and stable.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia will be one of only four provinces to table balanced budgets for the coming year. (Applause)</p>
<p>Turning the Corner to Economic Success</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, for two decades, Nova Scotia had the worst economic performance in Canada. Today, we are starting to turn the corner.</p>
<p>After 20 years at the very back of the pack of Canadian provinces, Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians can feel hopeful and optimistic about their future and that of their province. In just two years, the economic plan jobsHere is taking hold.</p>
<p>In Sydney Harbour, Mr. Speaker, lies the gateway to new economic opportunity for that city and region. The Deputy Premier was a great champion of ensuring that we made an investment that attracted the support of other levels of government to dredge the harbour, and as a result the region stands ready to turn its natural assets to long-term advantage for its citizens. (Applause)</p>
<p>This kind of economic infrastructure is dependent on having solid, reliable government-maintained infrastructure to get the products to market.</p>
<p>Our government is ready to begin discussions with the federal government about the successor to the Build Canada Fund so that, beginning in 2014, communities that have pressing infrastructure needs and a plan to address them, like the one brought forward by the Cape Breton Regional Municipality, can get to work, and put more Nova Scotians to work in the process. (Applause)</p>
<p>The National Shipbuilding Procurement contract is the biggest ever landed by a Nova Scotian company. The benefits will reach every community where workers are ready and able to compete, and it will mean an estimated 11,500 jobs will be created.</p>
<p>Supporting this game-changing opportunity is one of the greatest investments ever made by the Government of Nova Scotia - for every $6 loaned in support of this contract the province is able to earn $100. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, families can stay here, more schools across Nova Scotia will have students and teachers, more grocery stores and hairdressers will have increased business - for 30 years.</p>
<p>That is what jobsHere is all about - helping Nova Scotian companies and workers prepare for good jobs with a future. And that future will surely look different than the past in many areas of the province.</p>
<p>As a government we stand ready to support and invest in opportunities to help local economies thrive - whether by committing funds to the right ferry service to serve southwest Nova Scotia from Yarmouth, creating the building blocks to sustain the forestry of the future in communities like Liverpool and Port Hawkesbury, or working with world-leading LED Roadway Lighting to create a home-grown manufacturing success right in Amherst.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, more than 400 companies and 10,000 workers have benefited from jobsHere programs. That is what economic growth is all about. That is what makes life better for Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>Tax Measures</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, four years ago, the panel of economic experts told us that we also needed to increase revenue. We made the difficult decision to raise the HST two percentage points to 15 per cent and we brought in a fifth tax bracket for high-income Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Tax increases are neither easy nor popular, but they were necessary. Next year, as promised, Nova Scotians will see the tangible results of our improved finances with a phased-in reduction of the HST. The HST will be rolled back by one percentage point in 2014 and another percentage point in 2015.</p>
<p>In raising taxes, our government was guided by fairness, which demands that those least able to pay are protected. This year our Affordable Living and Poverty Reduction Tax rebates will provide $74 million in relief to low-income families and individuals. Since July 2010, the Affordable Living Tax Credit has put $178 million back in the pockets of families, and 14,000 Nova Scotians most in need have received up to $250 each year through the Poverty Reduction Credit. (Applause)</p>
<p>And fairness must be the hallmark of any progressive taxation system. To that end, Mr. Speaker, we will maintain the fifth tax bracket for the highest-income Nova Scotians - on taxable income of $150,000 a year or more - recognizing that from those who earn the most, more can reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Unlike previous governments, which made the decision to impose the HST on families by taxing the essentials of life, this province's first NDP Government stood up for families. For families purchasing children's clothing, children's footwear, and children's diapers, as well as books and home energy, over $380 million has been rebated since 2009-10. This budget will continue helping families make ends meet by providing almost $132 million in HST rebates. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the budget that honourable members have before them today, the budget that they will examine and debate in the days ahead, furthers this government's commitment to make life better for families, to ensure the health care system offers better care sooner, to create good jobs, and to extend to every Nova Scotian the opportunity to participate fully in the economic and social life of the province.</p>
<p>Tax measures for 2013-14 are designed to grow more competitive small businesses; help low-income Nova Scotians and seniors; keep young people and new graduates in Nova Scotia; help families put down roots with the purchase of their first home; grow job opportunities in film and digital media; and promote better health.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2014, this government will reduce tax rates for small businesses for the fourth year in a row. (Applause)</p>
<p>The rate of corporate income tax for small businesses will be 3 per cent. Since we came to office, we have reduced taxes on small businesses by 40 per cent, returning savings of almost $78 million for small businesses from Port Mouton to New Minas, from Amherst to Whitney Pier.</p>
<p>Annual savings to small businesses will exceed $33 million once this fourth consecutive tax reduction is implemented. Eligible small businesses can claim the reduced rate on their first $350,000 of taxable income.</p>
<p>In this budget, the government is continuing our commitment to support recent graduates, through an additional $6 million investment in the Graduate Retention Rebate Program. University students who graduated in and after 2009 can reduce their provincial income taxes, starting the year they graduate and in each of the next five years. In the years ahead, we will examine the criteria to qualify for this rebate to ensure that it is reaching first-time graduates and those who need it most.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, 28,000 Nova Scotians work in arts and culture industries, contributing almost $1.2 billion to our economy. The province is working with the industry to help provide the support needed to create more opportunities for these talented Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>This budget continues the government's support for the Film Industry Tax Credit. Since enhancements to this credit were announced in 2010, the film industry has received more than $62 million in tax benefits. It will receive another $24 million in 2013-14 to foster continued growth and employment opportunities. Producers are encouraged to hire locally because they can claim between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of eligible Nova Scotian labour costs. The Digital Media Tax Credit will continue in 2013. The province will continue to work with creative industry partners on how to best serve their sector.</p>
<p>The 2013-14 budget increases the provincial tax on tobacco. Effective at midnight tonight, the provincial tobacco tax will increase by 2 cents on each cigarette and on each gram of fine-cut tobacco. Increasing the cost of tobacco, Mr. Speaker, is a deterrent for first-time smokers, particularly youth.</p>
<p>Small Business Growth</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, over time governments have developed and launched new programs to support small business. I have no doubt that these programs were well-intentioned but as these programs proliferated, governments seemed to forget who they were for - small business. Most small businesses have neither the time nor the resources to comb through lists of programs and pages of eligibility criteria to see which ones might be for them. We are changing all that.</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Savoie, in his astute report to this government said, "The Nova Scotia government should set out to become the most business-friendly jurisdiction in Canada in terms of accessing government programs and services." We have taken up this challenge, and are turning the corner toward that goal.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we will reduce red tape for small business, ensuring that business owners can find and access the help they need to grow and succeed. Instead of wading through a complex list of nearly 40 programs, owners of small businesses will have five doors as clear entry points to the same range of programs and services. With better one-on-one support, more frequent site visits, and shorter approval times, government will better respond to the needs of small business. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in 2009 the economy was suffering and a new Nova Scotia Government recognized how important it was to keep jobs in communities. We developed the best-planned capital program in years and created an estimated 6,300 jobs across the province.</p>
<p>This budget includes $248.4 million to build and maintain roads and other transportation infrastructure; $38.4 million to improve information technology in public services like hospitals and schools; and $156.2 million to invest in new public facilities and land purchases.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's traditional industries are vital to our way of life and to the economy of the province. Nova Scotia is the only province in Canada experiencing growth in both the number of farms and in farm gate receipts. We want to keep that going. (Applause)</p>
<p>By relocating offices to Truro-Bible Hill, Cornwallis, and Shelburne, government will better serve farmers and fishermen. In addition, we will invest at least $250,000 to promote Buy Local food efforts through Select Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's Crown land holdings increased substantially in the past four years, when we acquired 550,000 acres in western Nova Scotia - the Bowater lands. We will be consulting extensively with communities, including the Mi'kmaq people, regarding the uses and preservation of this land. The Department of Natural Resources has budgeted $750,000 to ensure appropriate stewardship of this land, and an additional $2.4 million this year to continue implementation of the forestry strategy.</p>
<p>Turning the Corner</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians and this government have successfully faced down four difficult, post-recessionary years. There have been some bumps along the way, but collectively we have a lot to show for our efforts.</p>
<p>More Nova Scotian workers than ever are improving their skills, training for and getting better jobs. In fact, in 2012, more Nova Scotians were working than ever before in our history. (Applause)</p>
<p>Each year more emergency rooms are staying open. That trend will increase as the government's physician coverage program matures and our physician resource plan moves forward. This budget includes $3 million to increase the pool of doctors to fill shifts in rural ERs and to improve emergency care through new emergency department standards, paramedic coverage, and medical oversight in CECs.</p>
<p>Last year, the government engaged with Nova Scotians and front-line care providers to develop the province's first comprehensive plan to improve the lives of those who struggle with mental health issues and addictions. How previous governments could look away while an estimated one in five Nova Scotians suffered is beyond comprehension. Action to put the plan to work has begun, and additional funding is in this budget to help those who were ignored for too long. (Applause)</p>
<p>Seniors have more affordable care options than ever before. Since this government came to office there are almost 1,800 new or renovated long-term care beds. Home care services have significantly expanded and improved. In fact, this government has taken unprecedented steps to help seniors, and is again this year expanding the number that will no longer pay provincial taxes.</p>
<p>These are tangible actions to make life better and a little more affordable for seniors and their families.</p>
<p>This government has a long view, Mr. Speaker. Making life better and more affordable for families is not a quick-fix, stop-gap measure. It's not a one-time cheque for $155 dropped in your mailbox. It's not borrowing $600 million and pretending it's not a deficit.</p>
<p>Nowhere is a long-term view more important than in planning for Nova Scotia's energy future. This government's energy plan offers 35 years of secure supply and price stability. It offers clean local power production at competitive rates. It will ensure the lowest, fairest, tax-free electricity rates for Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>Some attempt to convince Nova Scotians that there are better options. But none has been offered that comes close to the benefits Nova Scotians will derive from this government's support of the Maritime Link and our Community Feed-in Tariff program promoting home-grown energy.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, over four years we've made huge strides as a government and as a province. It's progress we can build on that will make life better for families - the reason I got into this business in the first place.</p>
<p>We have a Premier with experience, a plan, and a vision to lead our province forward. He cares about families, fights for fairness, and believes we can make life here better.</p>
<p>Our back-to-balance plan was rooted in the collective wisdom of Nova Scotians and respected economic experts. We listened to their advice and we stuck to our plan.</p>
<p>That is why this budget is balanced. (Applause)</p>
<p>I want to thank the Premier, all members of this House, and indeed all Nova Scotians for playing a role in getting this great province back to balance and for putting us on the path toward a more prosperous future.</p>
<p>We must continue to look for ways to ensure that our economy turns the corner so our young people can stay and build a life here, Nova Scotians can return home from away, our most vulnerable are protected, and businesses all thrive.</p>
<p>Together, we have climbed a steep hill. Together, we will start seeing the hard work pay off. We are beginning to turn the corner. We cannot turn back. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Applause)</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure to rise, as the Finance Critic for the Liberal caucus, and reply to the budget document that we have before us, and the minister's Budget Speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's clear that the numbers in the budget speak for themselves. There are a number of very questionable practices - shall I say? - and approaches that need to be looked at carefully, and I'm sure Nova Scotians will do just that.</p>
<p>The government's credibility stood on trying to show a balanced budget and I believe that there was a determination, perhaps a desperation, to show that balanced budget today. That's exactly what we've just heard.</p>
<p>There were a lot of broken promises, Mr. Speaker, as we know, with this government over the four years. We've had the opportunity to listen to the Finance Minister's storyline about what has happened in the last four years, but there is another level of truth, as well, that goes with that storyline.</p>
<p>One is that the minister's story begins with the Deloitte study that was done saying that they were headed to a $1.4 billion deficit if nothing was done. Mr. Speaker, it's important for people to know that when you hire a consultant you give them the assumptions - and the assumptions made were false. They said that spending would continue to skyrocket and that revenue would stay flat, there'd be no change in revenue - then if you just plot that out on a chart, you see a rising deficit every year.</p>
<p>As I said in Question Period the other day, Mr. Speaker, to take credit for reversing a $1.4 billion deficit is ludicrous, because it never materialized. It was based on false assumptions; it was just a made-up number. And that is the basis of the narrative that we've heard today, that weaves through the story of the four years of NDP financial management.</p>
<p>I think there are two major points that we would like to make sure are clear today. The first is the credibility of these figures, and I want to start, Mr. Speaker, with the practice of prepaying universities. We've had discussions here in the House over the last number of days about where the government was going in terms of prepaying universities, and it was very clear that when this practice was tried by the Progressive Conservative Government in their last budget it was completely condemned by the NDP when they were in Opposition. They said it was wrong. The Premier, at the time called that budget a "fudge-it budget." Those were his words - he didn't believe it; it had no benefit, no substance. Well, that practice has gone on twice in the meantime. That was repeated again in 2009, and the then-Finance Minister did the same thing, but to a larger degree.</p>
<p>At that time he moved, I believe it was over $200 million, $278 million I think, or $256 million, was moved into the year before so that he could pass off the bigger deficit to blame it on the previous government. And when that was done, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to read what the editorial said in the The ChronicleHerald at that time - and I'll table this document after I read it. It said, "To see the NDP replaying the MOU pre-payment game is deeply disappointing - a bus-sized hit to the new government's credibility." And that's it.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, they were right in saying that - the credibility of the government was shaken greatly in that time by doing that very same thing that they had condemned, that the Premier had condemned, that the Minister of Finance himself had condemned earlier on. And so to do it again today is another hit to the credibility of this government. And people need to know that although they've taken the liberty of mentioning the word "balanced" numerous times, if you consider the prepayment for the university fees, which are $34 million this year, the university fees for two universities were prepaid in the last fiscal year, when that is considered, this budget is not balanced. It's $18 million in the hole - and that's the truth. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker there is no doubt about that, that is the truth - the prepayment to two universities makes this a falsely presented budget, a budget that is not balanced, and that is very, very fundamental to the credibility, believability, and reliability of this government - absolutely.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the minister in the very opening of her Budget Speech said that they didn't want to make choices that would be temporary and wouldn't be sustainable or realistic, and I'm saying today that when we see the first-quarter results come in from this budget, we'll see that it is not balanced even without looking at the prepayment for the universities. It's not going to be balanced. And that makes this even more of an election document than it is a budget for this province, because it's painting a rosy picture that is overly inflated on the revenue side, tremendously, in order to present that balanced look today - and that means that the government will have to go to an election before this is proven to be nothing but a stack of cards. And that will actually have to happen.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to just draw the attention of the members to the revenue estimates that are in this budget, because they are so inflated, they are so based on wishful thinking that they do need to be looked at individually.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we know that we've had a very poorly performing economy; we've had a very bad year this year; and we know that the government projections for the year just closing were off by quite a margin on both corporate and personal income taxes. And yet the government has gone forward in this budget and suggested that we will have a huge turnaround and get so much more in HST and in personal and in corporate income taxes; in fact, the budget - and anybody can see it in their budget brief - shows that they've estimated, for the coming year, $63.5 million up for HST revenue, and they've looked at $145 million more coming in on personal taxes, and $37 million more on corporate taxes.</p>
<p>You know, collectively, that's a lot of money - maybe that's where the $300 million question is that everybody was asking: how could the government bring in a balanced budget, and how could they overcome the $300 million that they were currently in deficit? And, in fact, they've done it by completely ballooning the expectations on revenue. The economy will not deliver these results. I'd love to think that more people will be working, that they'll be earning more money, that they'll be paying more taxes, buying more homes and cars - it's just not realistic, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>And in the government's documents themselves, given to us today, under the financial assumptions we can see that the assumption for 2013 is a 9.1 per cent unemployment rate. That's 0.1 per cent worse than this year - it was 9 per cent already. It's actually worse, 9.1 per cent. We know from Statistics Canada that there are 6,400 fewer people working in this province now than a year ago. Those people aren't paying income tax. (Applause)</p>
<p>In this one it says that in the coming two years Nova Scotia's economic growth is expected to fall below its long-run average. During this time there is little expectation of employment increase or improvements in unemployment rates. Nova Scotia's economic and labour market conditions will face headwinds from global uncertainty and ongoing fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is in one part of the budget documents and yet on the other hand, we're expecting over $200 million in increased revenue based on a buoyant employment picture. How can that be? We were looking for some magic, some sleight of hand or maybe just plain exaggeration and we've got that exaggeration here today, and that's exactly what we're faced with. In order to present a balanced budget today, the NDP Government had to go back to the same tired practices of Rodney MacDonald, the same practices that they condemned in prepaying universities and it is going to blow up at least by the time we get our first-quarter results.</p>
<p>It's based on inflated, wishful thinking, rose-coloured glasses or whatever you want to call it, it's not going to be sustainable, it's not going to be reliable and I think there's a high level of skepticism in the province about what exactly is going to be delivered in the months to come. This is not going to work.</p>
<p>There's no mention at all in the entire Budget Speech about debt and the debt of this province. In the four years that the government of the day have been there they have added $1.3 billion or more to the debt, it might even be higher this year. It's growing every year, the projections are an upward climb year by year and that is completely unsustainable for our province.</p>
<p>No mention of it in there, no special supplements that were given to us or special handouts to deal with the debt, no plan in place. Yet we know the Auditor General has pointed it out on two separate reports, we have to start considering the debt and the burden that it's leaving for the children of Nova Scotia and future generations. It's time to look at that. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Finance Minister left that out because it doesn't fit into her narrative which is based on, as I say, the fabrication of a figure from a consultant report based on false assumptions. We've had no special bulletins on debt for several years from this government and that is definitely a failing. It's an important part of where we need to go in the future that we have to consider more than stacking and inflating figures to get the results that look good and results the government wants to go to an election on, quite frankly. I think that people know that, they know there's hyperbole and exaggeration in the wake of an election.</p>
<p>The hurt to education continues in this budget. There's another $11 million taken out of public education, just out of the public education program. That $11 million, added to what we've told you before, $65 million has already been gutted from education. That's going to create more hardship and it will hurt, it absolutely will hurt parents and students. Again, it's galling to hear the government say there would be no harm to important public services when education has clearly been eroded in the last four years. Our economy will only rebuild when we start to invest in education and help our students.</p>
<p>I didn't want to take too long today in my opening remarks. I think the important thing to point out today is that the revenue estimates in this budget we've seen today are completely unrealistic. I would love to say that they were right because I'd like to see more people working in every corner of Nova Scotia but we have more people working part time. The boast that comes from the government about having the most people working that we've ever had reflects part-time workers. A lot of them are juggling more than one job in order to make ends meet because of the difficulty in affording to live in Nova Scotia. That's a reality that we can't escape.</p>
<p>We're losing personal income tax revenue this year, we have a projected 9.1 per cent unemployment rate for the coming year, it is completely unrealistic to think that we would suddenly be able to materialize $200 million and more in HST and corporate and personal income tax.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this budget is really built on a stack of cards, and I think it will be shown in the future to be exactly that. We see it as an electioneering document and very little more. It doesn't have the substance and the reliability that we would expect in a provincial budget, and we look forward to having an opportunity to speak about it further when I continue my reply.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'd like to adjourn debate on this. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>The motion is carried.</p>
<p>We will now return to the daily routine. Before I go to the daily routine, the topic for late debate, as submitted earlier, reads:</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the Minister of Education's request to halt school closures, after months of tumultuous school reviews in communities across the province, and $65 million in funding cuts, is an empty political move that shows no respect for public education or communities.</p>
<p>It was submitted by the honourable member for Bedford-Birch Cove.</p>
<p>Before we start the daily routine, I have a Speaker's Ruling.</p>
<p><b>SPEAKER'S RULING: </b>Question by Dart. East MLA to Treasury Bd. Min. imputed motives to the minister (Pt. of order by Hon. F. Corbett, [Hansard p.243, 02/04/13) Member found to have imputed motive and that the member "should retract any such suggestion".</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the honourable Government House Leader raised a point of order with respect to a question posed to him by the honourable member for Dartmouth East during Question Period. The Government House Leader said that the member had imputed motives to him in that question, and asked me to review Hansard as to what was said.</p>
<p>I reviewed Hansard from Tuesday and have seen in the question that I believe is at issue that the member for Dartmouth East raised a point that the Treasury Board, of which the Government House Leader, as Deputy Premier, is Chair, had not approved an increase to the Auditor General's budget that had been recommended by the Special Committee to Review the Estimates of the Auditor General and the Chief Electoral Officer.</p>
<p>The member had said, "Mr. Speaker, is the Deputy Premier just trying to get back at the Auditor General for embarrassing him?" Imputing that the honourable Government House Leader took revenge upon the Auditor General for carrying out his duties by using the budget process to reduce the Auditor General's budget is a very serious allegation. It is unparliamentary and contrary to convention and usage for any member to impute to another member bad motives or motives different from those acknowledged by that other member with respect to anything said or done by that other member.</p>
<p>Beauchesne on Page 141 states that "&#x2026; a member, while speaking, must not impute bad motives or motives different from those acknowledged by a member." Beauchesne goes on to say on Page 142 that "&#x2026; a member will not be permitted by the Speaker to &#x2026; impute to any members or members unworthy motives for their actions in a particular case."</p>
<p>The meaning of the phrase "impute bad motives," as used in the parliamentary context, is sometimes questioned. Often it is not clear that the imputation being complained of is one of bad motives when a complaint is raised that another member is "imputing motives." It is assumed when that phrase is used that the motives are bad or different from any motives that may have been acknowledged.</p>
<p>The Parliament of Canada publishes a <i>Glossary of Parliamentary Procedures</i>, which defines "to impute motives" as to "&#x2026; ascribe objectionable motives or motives to a member different from those acknowledged by the member." Their underlying principle is that one member should not allege that another member has said or done something for an unworthy or hidden purpose.</p>
<p>It is well-established in this House that it is not acceptable to impute improper motives to another member. I draw members' attention to a ruling by former Speaker Russell on May 20, 1999, in which he stated that alleging a member is saying something because he has a vendetta against someone for something they have done is imputing motive.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the honourable Opposition House Leader countered the point of privilege by saying that the member for Dartmouth East was not making a direct allegation imputing motives but had been asking a question that the Government House Leader, in his capacity as Deputy Premier, could answer.</p>
<p>It is clear from Beauchesne that questions that impute motives to a member are out of order in the same manner as a direct allegation imputing motives. At Page 121 it states, "&#x2026; a question must adhere to the proprieties of the House, in terms of inferences, imputing motives, or casting aspersions upon persons within the House or out of it."</p>
<p>For examples in this House, members can see the ruling of Speaker Russell on April 16, 1999, ruling a question out of order because it imputed motives, or the ruling of Speaker Scott on April 20, 2004, to the same effect.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I find the suggestion made in Question Period on Tuesday by the member for Dartmouth East, that the Deputy Premier had abused his position as Chair of the Treasury Board to exact revenue on the Auditor General, to have imputed motives, and that the honourable member should retract any suggestion.</p>
<p>The honourable member for Dartmouth East.</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in your capacity as the Chair of the Management Commission, we'd ask if you could advise the members of the House as to what did take place in this matter in the fact that the Management Commission was asked to review a number of proposals for funding of the Auditor General's Office. A motion was agreed upon by the commission, but then was reversed by the Treasury Board.</p>
<p>Therefore, as members of the commission and as members of the Legislature, we are left to ask, why was the commission even asked to make such a recommendation or a decision when it was reversed by the Treasury Board? If this should have gone to the Treasury Board all along, why was it even in front of the Management Commission to start off with?</p>
<p>So in light of your capacity of Chair of the Management Commission, maybe you could advise us at a later date of exactly whether there are going to be changes in the future, that a decision of the Management Commission will be honoured by the government. Why is this even being considered by the Management Commission if government can turn around and do as they please in this? Hopefully you can take the opportunity to review that and advise on what will happen in the future for the Management Commission on such issues as the Auditor General's budget, and Election Nova Scotia's budget as well.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, everyone has been wondering if the Liberals have a plan to create jobs and it turns out they do, starting with former Liberal candidates. In other words, to hire Liberals. Clearly, the Party that dumped its former Leader, John Savage, for trying to do away with such blatant patronage is now back in power here in Nova Scotia. That's not the Party that presented itself to Nova Scotians in the recent election but it is the one we have before us today.</p>
<p>I have with me, and I will table, the Fair Hiring Policy of the Government of Nova Scotia which states, among other things, that hiring activities in the government are based on the principles of merit and shall include such things as advertising, selection criteria and interviews. I want to ask the Premier a simple question: did he follow his own fair hiring process when he hired a Liberal as the new Protocol Officer? I'll table that for the House.</p></speech>

<p>The motion is carried.</p>
<p>The honourable Minister of Community Services.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Premier for his answer, but unfortunately, the answer is no, he didn't follow his own fair hiring process. In the policy itself it lists positions that are allowed to be exempt from the fair hiring policy of the civil service. It lists such positions as assistant deputy ministers, CEOs, executive assistants to Cabinet Ministers, and so on. It specifically does not list the Protocol Officer, meaning that it's required that the Protocol Officer position go through the fair hiring policies of the government. Unfortunately, the Premier didn't follow his own policies. I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier and the House.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that Nova Scotians, who are the taxpayers who are going to pay the bill for this job, did not have a fair chance to compete for it. I know that in the election the Liberal campaign slogan was "Nova Scotia first", but now that the election is over, it's pretty clear that the real slogan is "Liberals first, everyone else second."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it's pretty clear the Premier exempted himself from his own government's fair hiring policy to pay off a friend, something that is forbidden under the rules. My question to the Premier is, why does he tell the Public Service to do as I say but not as I do?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm very proud of the fact that, given the privilege to be the Premier of this province, one of the first things I did was take the opportunity to go from department to department, recognizing the great public servants that we have in this province doing tremendous work on behalf of all Nova Scotians. (Applause)</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party that we did not appoint someone into the Public Service. What we've done is we've hired a qualified Nova Scotian to fill the job as Chief Protocol Officer in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I also want to remind all members of this House that it was on a contract basis, which is renewed annually, and there is no payout at the end of this contract.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR.

He can visit as many public servants as he wants, but when he breaks his own rules, that is what he will ultimately be judged by.</p>
<p>I do agree that the Protocol Office serves an important function. In fact, it is responsible for something as important as the Order of Nova Scotia. Past winners of the Order of Nova Scotia include such eminent Nova Scotians as Anne Murray, Muriel Duckworth, John Savage himself - and I can just imagine what he is thinking today, Mr. Speaker - and Rocky Jones.</p>
<p>I will ask the Premier, why does he believe it is okay to politicize such an important office?</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the last time the Liberal Party was in government, back in the 1990s, they did the very same thing, appointed a Liberal Party insider as Chief of Protocol and passed over a 35-year veteran of the navy who had handled two royal visits and numerous tours by Prime Ministers and Governors General. I'd like to table some articles from the Cape Breton Post entitled Province Settles Patronage Dispute. This decision cost the province $67,000 a year following a complaint to the Human Rights Commission due to discrimination based on political affiliation.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier is, did the Premier decide not to hold an open competition for this $85,000-a-year position in order to avoid any embarrassing legal action if his favorite candidate wasn't successful in a fair and open competition?</p></speech>

The Fair Hiring Policy states that "&#x2026; members of the public must be provided with reasonable access to notification of career opportunities within the Government of Nova Scotia." So I have a simple question. Was this position advertised, and if so, will the Premier provide a copy of that advertisement to the House before the end of Question Period today?</p>

          <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in Opposition the Liberal Government criticized the past government for their corporate bailouts. In a ChronicleHerald article this morning the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism was quoted as saying, "The whole idea here, if we're making an investment, is to help them grow, help them put people to work and not put that at risk." I'd like to table that, please.</p>
<p>It has been two months since the Liberals formed government and we have their first bailout, $1 million going to a company - to create jobs? No. To invest in infrastructure? No. The company is paying off private debt with government funds. My question to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism is, is paying off a corporation's private debt a corporate bailout?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for the question. The fact is, this was a decision that was brought forward to our government by Nova Scotia Business Incorporated with the support of their board. Ironically, later today we will be debating a bill by the Official Opposition asking that more funding be given to Nova Scotia Business Incorporated to do economic development. I'm a bit confused - does the Official Opposition support the decisions, the independent arm's length decisions of Nova Scotia Business Incorporated or don't they?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in an article in allnovascotia.com, the CEO was quoted as saying that the company had no bank account to speak of and the company was "running on fumes", and I'll table that document as well. The definition of bailout, in case you're not aware, is an act of giving financial assistance to a failing business. The government gave the funds; the company was running on fumes. My question to the minister is, has the definition of bailout changed or was this a bailout?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately what the member failed to read in that article and other articles is the fact that this business has been turning itself around, in fact it is now moving in the right direction. I should add as well, what the member fails to recognize is that there are also two other private investment partners that are putting additional investments in this company. Maybe she wants to put her question to those private investors as well, whether she thinks that they're putting money into a bailout or into what they see as an appropriate investment.</p>

          <speech by="#3b49aa8d-3e78-4679-b8f7-f3161f11d3a3">
            <from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. In 2011 the NDP made a decision to purchase a mobile paving plant, based on a business case, and we were happy to share the business case with all Nova Scotians, and I'll table that. Background information and statistics were available to the public on the government Web site. For some reason this evidence can no longer be found on-line. Can the minister please tell Nova Scotians when he received a business plan to eliminate the chip-seal crew and the asphalt plant?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#2c8e1a56-2f9d-4156-a91f-77802701e3d3"><from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as the member would know and the House would know, when the paving plant was brought to the House back in 2011, we opposed that endeavour by the former government. Number one, we don't agree that the government should be in private sector business; we shouldn't be competing with the private sector. This is a great example of that where it's a robust industry, the road builders and the paving industry here in Nova Scotia. That's no secret, Mr. Speaker. The financials - and I'm sure that the member wants to debate the numbers - I welcome that debate. I'm very familiar with the numbers that were associated with the paving plant. None of the financials, none of the numbers, none of the information supports keeping the paving plant on-line.</p>
<p>Number three, there's a minimal impact, if any at all, on employees. I met with the leaders for CUPE to ensure them that all jobs that were connected to the paving plant will revert back to the seniority list within Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Anyone who was affected we will look at individually, to make sure the minimum impact is felt with employees. We don't want anyone to lose their job, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Finally, I've talked to many Nova Scotians in my own riding, on my own island and across this province. We made the right decision, they know we made the right decision. We shouldn't be in the paving business and that's pretty obvious. (Applause)</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3b49aa8d-3e78-4679-b8f7-f3161f11d3a3"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all this is no backbencher asking a question to the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. First of all, CUPE was outside here the first day, in a protest. In the first day, a week of your government, there was a protest at your constituency office.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the decision to purchase a paving plant was made based on a business case. It meant that Nova Scotia could pay less for paving and could therefore pave more throughout the province. That decision had its biggest impact on rural roads in isolated regions of our province. It meant that roads that were traditionally unattractive to private paving firms could be done by a provincial crew. Simply put, it meant no one in rural Nova Scotia would be left behind.</p>
<p>My question, Mr. Speaker, to the minister is - and I'll try my question in a different way - again, what actual evidence does the minister have to suggest that getting rid of the public paving plant will benefit Nova Scotians? Since the minister hasn't made any evidence available online, could he please table this information?</p></speech>

MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I think it's very unfair that the information that's being spread by the NDP with respect to the paving plant is inaccurate. There are two points that they're making and I'd like to address them now. First of all, prices in the paving industry dropped in the last number of years because we've had increased competition. (Interruption) Well if you'd like the answer, let me finish it.</p>
<p>We've had increased competition from New Brunswick, Mr. Speaker, so in the last three years, between 2011 and 2014 budgeted, we've spent $167 million more just on roads, which means - we have an Atlantic Procurement Agreement, which means that those companies can come here and bid on our jobs. There's increased competition, that forces the prices down, that's what happened.</p>
<p>Secondly, with respect to rural roads, we do a pretty poor job with tendering. We've got to tighten up the tendering process, we've got to get them out earlier and when we're putting companies in remote areas and we're asking them to do jobs, we've got to package those tenders so we can make sure that the logistics work to get Nova Scotians working.</p>
<p>By the way, Mr. Speaker, the people in the construction industry and the people in the paving industry - they hire Nova Scotians too, and it's an important industry for all of us. (Applause)</p></speech>
          <speech by="#3b49aa8d-3e78-4679-b8f7-f3161f11d3a3"><from>MR. BELLIVEAU</from><p>Mr. Speaker, you can see that it sounds to me like the minister doesn't have a business case.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the NDP recognized the purchase of the asphalt plant ensuring paving could take place in isolated communities that weren't attractive to private contractors. This will prove to be true with roads in remote communities, in Victoria and Guysborough Counties, just for example, as those communities receive paving that was long overdue.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, why would the minister do away with a chip seal crew and asphalt plant when he knows paving in rural communities will suffer as a result? This is no backbencher asking the minister a question, I expect results. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#2c8e1a56-2f9d-4156-a91f-77802701e3d3"><from>MR. MACLELLAN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. It's coming from a member who just asked that question in his previous remarks. I just answered it and he just read the question, as opposed to reacting to what I just said so if he wants to talk about the business case, we just talked about the business case. This does not drive prices down - it doesn't drive prices down, this is not how this works.</p>
<p>The paving plant did not compete with the private sector. The NDP will make the claim that it was a competitor with the private sector, which is entirely inaccurate because it didn't bid on projects. The private sector bid on their own and the private sector did that as a competition. The government selected certain spots and sent the paving plant there.</p>
<p>That's not competition, Mr. Speaker. That doesn't affect the prices in the industry at all. The reality is, and Nova Scotians know this, we made the right decision. We're standing by that decision and the people of Nova Scotia can be proud that the Liberal Government here in early days in office made a good call on their behalf and we're sticking by that.</p></speech>

Now that they have a chance to correct all the mistakes of the previous government, which I will admit is no small task, the government is caught in its own flip-flops.

I will table that. From comments to media lately, the government's Cabinet plans to continue making decisions on where taxpayers' money goes rather than an arm's-length entity.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism is, what changed in the last 56 days from where the current government slammed the past government for Cabinet-controlled slush funds, to supporting the practice once becoming government?</p></speech>

MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier agreed in Opposition that the multi-million dollar fund which hands out money to businesses to spur job creation lacks oversight and should be managed by an arm's-length agency rather than politicians. He said in a CBC article on May 17, 2011, "It's done in the secrecy of a cabinet room and it raises serious questions when Nova Scotians are not given an opportunity to review business plans," and he went on to say, "This is nothing more than a slush fund for cabinet ministers." I will table that.</p>
<p>My question to you, minister, is, which version of the Premier will answer this question - the one who stood up for taxpayers in Opposition or the one who wants his Cabinet to have control of that money?</p></speech>

With all due respect, this is only day two of Question Period and we're seeing flip-flops from the Official Opposition pretty quickly.</p>
<p>As I indicated, a review is underway. As I mentioned, we are waiting for the Ivany commission report to come out - hopefully in early 2014 - which will give us a better sense of the challenges and some of the opportunities that we have moving forward and dealing with the economy of Nova Scotia.

<p>Whereas in December 2012, the Royal Bank in Guysborough honoured their volunteers and their contributions through the Employee Volunteer Grants program; and</p>

<p>Whereas Jeanie Hart from the RBC branch in Guysborough has taken part in the Employee Volunteer Grants Program for the local hospital;</p>
<p>Therefore be it resolved that the members of this House of Assembly congratulate Jeanie Hart from the Royal Bank of Guysborough for her generosity, kindness, and ongoing dedication to her community.</p>

<p>We all sympathize with the families of Raymond Taavel, who was killed 18 months ago, and also with the family of Andre Denny, who was on unescorted leave from the East Coast Forensic Hospital and is now facing a charge of murder. Many people believe that GPS ankle bracelets would monitor the movement of patients on leave, or offenders on bail, and give the authorities the tools they need to locate a person quickly. That could have made a difference for Mr. Taavel, and our actions in this Legislature can make a difference in the life of a future Nova Scotian.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister protect Nova Scotians from potentially dangerous people in our communities and use ankle bracelets?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we too very much sympathize with the Taavel family. It's very important to remember in this House that people receiving care in the forensic centre are patients and not offenders. I know my colleague in Health and Wellness has been studying this issue and we, at Justice, are very happy to look at all these reports and make recommendations with our colleagues.</p>
          </speech>

MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, this is not just about patients, but it's also about offenders and the potential for a patient to become an offender, as we saw with the Taavel case. This past October, Paul Calnen was released on bail and he now lives in Hammonds Plains; he is charged with the murder of his girlfriend and, sadly, with the burning of her remains. No police officer can monitor that individual for 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will she explain to the families of her neighbouring constituency why this accused offender is unmonitored, only monitored based on his honour and his personal commitment to meet the terms of his house arrest?</p></speech>

This is an issue that the Department of Health and Wellness has moved to a study position. The Wickwire Home report has, in fact, spent quite a bit of time addressing GPS tracking as one of the possible options that can be used.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to say that at the East Coast Forensic Centre, the 18 recommendations that were made after the Taavel tragedy have been implemented, certainly around the assessment of the patient, around education of the staff, more rigour in determining the supervised and unsupervised passes - but yet we know there will be occasions when a patient may not return, so for that reason we are taking a look at the best information coming out of the United Kingdom and in collaboration with Justice we will have a recommendation coming forward.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#6918f31d-8900-4400-a42c-b0374b14b8ff"><from>MR. MACMASTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know the government is concerned about the self-esteem of the patients and what could happen to them and their minds if they are wearing one of these bracelets. I do know that in the U.K. there is even recognition that it actually leads to more freedom for patients because there is a higher level of trust because the bracelet ensures that they are monitored 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Now last week we saw another patient, who was deemed not criminally responsible for a crime, disappear from the East Coast Forensic Hospital. This is the same start of events that led to Mr. Taavel's death. This government has a chance to improve safety. My question to the Minister of Justice or to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, how many Nova Scotians will be put in harm's way before we get moving with more use of these ankle bracelets?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, right now we are taking a look at what are the ethical, the legal, the human rights, whether or not our Criminal Code structure can also be applied in the same way as these bracelets are used in the UK with incarcerated prisoners and prisoner/patients in their case. For that reason, we have to make sure that we do the best research on this.</p>
<p>I can assure the honourable member that this Minister of Health and Wellness will not be shy about being the first province in Canada with this GPS monitoring if it is, indeed, the right direction to go.</p></speech>

For hundreds of years they have provided good jobs that keep our young people here at home, instead of going down the road. Our forests are also places of great beauty and diversity. Striking the balance between conservation and economic prosperity is a fine line and not everyone is going to agree upon how this balance can be achieved.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, how does this minister expect to maintain Nova Scotia's new reputation as a leader in Crown land management when he has members of his own caucus - the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie, for example - on record calling Nova Scotia's land protection targets absolutely insane and a complete farce?</p></speech>

            <from>HON. ZACH CHURCHILL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. When the vote came to this House of Assembly on the protected land targets it was a unanimous vote. It was a 12 per cent target that all Parties in this House supported and those targets remain committed to by this government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#c479d7de-83a6-47c7-a045-07816407bdb3"><from>MS. ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to hear that the minister now supports what our former government did. Actually we exceeded that target and we got 13 per cent instead of 12 per cent. The NDP stood shoulder-to-shoulder with forestry workers and conservationists when the former Bowater lands came under provincial jurisdiction. We stood up and protected the land that we all call home.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, given that the minister has been an outspoken proponent of reducing our protected lands, can he explain how he plans to strike that fine line now that he is responsible for both the economic well-being of those who work the forest and also those who simply want to enjoy it?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, just to clarify for the House of Assembly, I have never been a proponent of reducing protected land targets. In fact I voted for those protected land targets in this House of Assembly, along with every other single member.</p>
<p>Our government remains committed to those targets. What the member is referring to is a petition that I signed that was brought to my attention, from constituents, signed by over 2,200 people, who did not feel that their views were included in the consultation process that the previous government had laid out for those protected lands. That is a community that lives in a border area with those protected lands.</p>
<p>Differently from the previous government, we'll make sure those views are considered when we move forward on these discussions.</p></speech>

Being responsible for the largest amount of Crown land in Nova Scotia's history will not be easy. It's going to be a hard job and today it's going to be even harder because this minister is now tasked with reducing his Natural Resources budget by 1 per cent.

STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, 6,400 fewer Nova Scotians are working full-time this year than last, and today we learned government is predicting unemployment will increase in the coming year. They also predict that personal income tax revenues will increase by $145 million. I know the NDP struggle with math by dealing with their $27 million they forgot to tell us about last year, but I don't think any Nova Scotians are going to believe that math equation.</p>
<p>So my question to the Premier is, how can this Premier tell us with a straight face that he is going to collect more income tax with fewer and fewer Nova Scotians working?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know there has always been a confusion on which part it is but Part 1 of the Gaming Control Act is VLTs. There you go. So I thank the honourable member for the question.</p>
<p>The issue of Aboriginal gaming is far more complicated than some of the other parts, as the member will be aware. It is governed by the 2011 Aboriginal gaming agreement with the province. Obviously that is an agreement between governments, between the province and between the Aboriginal community, and we respect that agreement.</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think the question really speaks for itself. It's representative of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition doesn't understand labour force statistics and wants to deliberately mislead Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, more Nova Scotians will be working. Even if unemployment should increase, more Nova Scotians will be working. They will be working at higher levels of income, Mr. Speaker, which means that the level of income will grow and, therefore, personal income tax will grow.</p></speech>

I will table the transcript of that committee meeting now.</p>
<p>My question to the minister, does the minister responsible agree with his Party's past position or has it changed now that they are in government?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think we heard that from the Premier last year and you know where that got us. One thing we know for sure is this government has failed miserably at growing the economy and they can't dispute it, even though government will try, yet this government's rosy revenue projections say that they will collect $75 million more in HST in that same year as this government is predicting fewer Nova Scotians will be working.</p>

He did not give an unqualified endorsement of the revenue projections, he said he couldn't say. He should read the document.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a government that has created a fictional $1.4 billion deficit that never existed. This is a government that has manipulated its first budget by prepaying universities. This is a government that in its second budget was off by $0.75 billion and that is billion dollars with a "b". This is a government that lost $87 million in Public Accounts documents. This is a government that failed to disclose a $27 million overstatement in revenues last year.</p>

A gaming centre with 45 VLTs will soon be opened in a residential area of Hammonds Plains. There are plans to add 100 more machines. The local residents opposed the centre.</p>
<p>My question to the minister, will the government resurrect its 2006 bill or will it sit back and let that gaming centre go ahead, despite what the Minister of Health and Wellness said in 2004 and 2006?</p></speech>

YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first I would suggest that the honourable member talk to his federal cousins since the only reason that is being allowed to go ahead is because of a federal decision on creating band lands in that area.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the honourable member will be well aware that there are allocations of VLTs under the 2011 gaming agreement. That gaming agreement, just like any other agreement between the Government of Nova Scotia and an Aboriginal community, is an agreement in good faith. It is a contact between those parties.</p>

JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, despite what the government claims, of all those people they claimed to have consulted on this budget, 6,700 of them lost their full-time job in the last 12 months. Unlike the two previous gentlemen, I actually have the Statistics Canada report, seasonally adjusted, which I will table so the Premier knows: 6,700 full-time jobs lost in the last 12 months. Nova Scotians know that you cannot say that Nova Scotia is in balance when so many people lose their jobs. In this budget they project more job losses, not less in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>I will ask the Premier, will he acknowledge what all Nova Scotians know, that there is no balanced plan when so many people are out of work?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. I know the minister has been in his role for only a couple of months but I know from his many years in this House that he also held the role of Health Critic and he also understands the needs of those requiring renal dialysis in this province. I wonder if the minister is committed to reviewing some of the decisions made by past governments that do not address the needs of all Nova Scotians, especially those in rural Nova Scotia?</p>

            <from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I really thank the member opposite, the Health Critic, for that question. It's a very significant question. There are over 3,000 Nova Scotians who suffer from some form of kidney disease, over 500 who receive dialysis. There are three programs across Nova Scotia - one in Sydney, one in Yarmouth and of course the largest one here at the QE II. The QE II, therefore, is the guiding health authority or department that decides on what satellite communities will be established. Presently Kentville is the community that will receive the next satellite dialysis opportunity in the province. That should be in place within about 18 months and it's going to do two things and that is take pressure off the program here at the QE II as well as allow more people to stay in the Valley as opposed to commuting to Halifax.</p>

This is a person who stood in front of a sign at his convention that said "Stop more jobs." The reality is that more people will work this year in this province; they are going to work at higher rates of pay.</p>
<p>We're working hard by making good investments in things like the shipyard contract to bring 11,500 more jobs to our province. PROJEX, an investment that is going to bring 440 more &#x2026;</p></speech>

I know he's very familiar, and I certainly know how familiar he is with the decisions that have been made for Kentville. Now, I wouldn't suggest for a moment that Kentville does not deserve to have dialysis in that area - they do, as does Berwick, where they are currently located and many people travel to from my area as well.</p>
<p>There was a suggestion, however, that - we are all familiar with the Hants Community Hospital, I know that the minister is - in the Windsor area that has volunteers, a board and a foundation that has raised tens of thousands of dollars, Mr. Speaker, to support the purchase of renal dialysis units there. They also have staff whom I have spoken to who are willing to come back home to work. Would the minister consider this, given all of the options that have been put out there, the support that does exist and still exists, to review that decision for Kentville - maybe share some of that wealth, if he will, throughout the Valley to cover all areas and to relieve some of the physical and mental stress as well as the financial burdens that go along with those travelling for dialysis treatment?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, this is one of the health areas that we know is going to have greater demands in the future, just looking at the aging population, and it goes along with of course chronic disease, and sometimes multiple diseases that our citizens will have. So at the present time there isn't a plan for Windsor, but looking at the demand that we will have and trying to take some pressure off the 42 beds, three shifts that go through the QE II, I am sure that there can be a review to get best guidance from the QE II as to the need and the help that may be able to be provided from other sites across the province.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, again I thank the honourable minister for that answer. A review is one word and I guess that's where we can start, but I really hope that he takes seriously what is being offered by those folks in the Windsor-West Hants area. What they have to offer is something that has not been offered anywhere else, minister, and I know that you know that as well. So what an opportunity to seek that help and to add it to straining budgets. We know that they all exist, we know things cost money, but I hope seriously that the minister will do more than take it under review, that he will look at a serious plan in the months ahead to have some discussions with those people out there as well who deserve to be treated fairly and to take those stresses off those travelling who need that renal dialysis.</p>

One of the facts that we should all know in this House about the renal program in our province is that we're actually a national leader in the number of citizens who actually receive a kidney transplant. That is a very, very good thing that we're able to speak about on a per capita basis, having the highest number of kidney transplants which becomes a final health delivery for many people.</p>
<p>That being said, we know the kind of pressure that is on renal dialysis and I certainly compliment the member opposite for the work he has done on this file and also the citizens in the Windsor area who want to see a site there.

There are 3,900 farms in Nova Scotia and over the last four years our NDP Government has supported farmers and young farmers staying in Nova Scotia and moving to Nova Scotia. Therefore, Nova Scotia is the only province in Canada to see its number of farms actually increase. We now have 236 farms that have grown in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will he please tell the House his plans to ensure the growth of farms in Nova Scotia and that it continues to increase?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, that's not true, he knows that's not true. He knows that wage income is growing in Nova Scotia; he knows that the quality of jobs that are coming here are growing. What you are getting is job losses on the lower end but what you're seeing is new, high-quality jobs which means that people are making a better wage and they are better able to afford the kind of life that I think especially young families in this province would want.</p>
<p>We are seeing the kinds of investments that I understand the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party says that he would make, and I understand that he would be satisfied with having another 1,500 people unemployed in Port Hawkesbury or another 1,000 people unemployed in Liverpool but that is not the job of this government. The job of this government is to make sure that we put people to work and that's what we're doing.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the only plan we saw for jobs today from the Premier and his government was to reach into the pockets of every single Nova Scotian for another $300 each; that is not a plan that's in balance when you have to grab another $300 out of the pockets of everyday Nova Scotians.

<p>Mr. Speaker, not everyone in Nova Scotia is fortunate enough to have immediate access to farm-fresh food, nor do they have the choice to shop at a local farm instead of at a chain store. I know, for instance, that the Federation of Agriculture is very keen to improve farmers' lives and livelihoods by supporting locally-grown food.</p>

            <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, in the 2009 Deloitte report this government was warned not to continue the practice of prepaying sums to universities. This government didn't listen and has prepaid to universities not only once but twice. So my question to the Premier is, why does the Premier think it is okay to prepay universities?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, in fact the practice of prepaying was one that was really an invention of the former government and we have reduced the amount of prepays considerably and we've got down to the point now where only two universities require prepays, and if they were not prepaid they would not be able to meet their payroll obligations.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we're working with them, we intend to move them off that so that further prepays are not necessary. They are for this year, we don't believe they will be for next year but we're working with the universities to make sure that their needs are met.</p></speech>

COLWELL</from><p>We intend to maintain the very important programs that are in place to support the growth of farming in Nova Scotia and also to make the farms more viable. There's a serious business case and we've had discussions already with the Federation of Agriculture around training farmers to be more efficient, more business-like in their operations and that's very important.</p>
<p>As we move forward the member will see that we've got a very aggressive agenda for the farming industry in the province. We hope to grow that industry, we hope to grow it on a solid base and a base that will ensure that the industry survives and grows and we can get more local product into Nova Scotia, instead of being imported from outside the province.</p></speech>

<p>The last time this Premier prepaid universities in his fiscal shell game The ChronicleHerald called it "deeply disappointing" and it hits at the NDP's credibility.

We met the requests they made in order to allow them to be able to fulfill their obligations.</p>
<p>In return, because they are prepaid, they receive a reduced amount equal to the interest that they would earn on the money for receiving it early, because we seek to be fair with them - the same way we are fair with all of the universities.</p></speech>

In my former life, this has been an issue that has plagued me for a very long time. Seniors in Nova Scotia really had been left behind by the previous government and, despite recent calls by the Progressive Conservative caucus to respond to the growing wait-list for these long-term care facilities, nothing was really done. Now while in Opposition, Liberals remained silent on the issue but we have recently learned that they plan to come up with a new Continuing Care Strategy.</p>

We know there is demand for respite to provide families, who give a large amount of care to their parents, an opportunity to be able to have rest and recovery. During the past year the previous government put an additional $22 million into the home care program so we can get some sense of the growing demands that it requires. The more we research the more we hear that people want to stay in their own home and we need to put those kind of supports and helps in place so that the caregiver doesn't get burnt out and gets the kind of relief to continue what is high quality care in their own home.</p>

I know when I was in palliative care at the hospital in Truro, many people were on a wait-list for long-term care and although many seniors wish to remain in their own homes, there are instances where it's just not possible. Now, without the proper resources and the long waits, seniors are often too frail to return home once they're seen by their doctor. The Premier has said that he does not plan to honour the promise for new long-term beds. The Liberals have also not indicated whether they will live up to the remaining commitments under the original Continuing Care Strategy.</p>
<p>So my question is, how does the minister expect to address the growing wait-lists without recognizing the needs of those who can no longer live at home?</p></speech>

There are more Nova Scotians working in the province today than at any other point in our history - that is a fact.</p>
<p>The other thing that is factual is that incomes, in fact, of Nova Scotians are increasing, including incomes of people who are retired. So they may not necessarily be in the workforce, but they certainly have higher taxable incomes.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know the current number is at slightly over 2,500 hoping to get into a nursing home. As I've said previously, there is a range of frailty that our seniors are experiencing, and some need to be in a nursing home today. Maybe others, with help and support to the home, can remain there longer. Over the course of our government in office we will address those communities that are in need of nursing home replacement beds, and we will continue to take a look at some geographic areas that have no nursing home beds at the moment. It is of major concern in our province that we do first update those nursing homes that need to be replaced.</p>

That's an important thing. We're splitting hairs if we argue about that. Nova Scotians aren't interested, they know who has money in their pocket and who doesn't.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the revenue projections remain overly optimistic, to turn around to the extent that the minister has suggested. The provincial unemployment rate today stands at 9.3 per cent and is estimated to continue in that range at 9.1 or 9.2 per cent. This hides serious challenges, too, that are outside of HRM - Cape Breton, 17 per cent unemployment; Annapolis Valley is 10.4 per cent; 12.2 per cent in southern Nova Scotia; and 12.5 per cent along the North Shore. The Premier and members know that. Serious employment challenges are going to affect the budget outcome and yet the minister continues to say there will be $145 million more in revenue.</p>

The economic benefit of this land, the timber exports, and the value-added products manufactured by these lands increase that value greatly. There were over 300 jobs lost - when you consider the loss of timber into the economy, that trickles down to many, many more that have been negatively affected. So my question to the minister is, when will the lands be opened up for harvesting so the economy can start to rebuild?</p>

WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the inflated revenue figures fly in the face of common sense; I don't care what the minister says, it's not common sense. It will tell you that if you have fewer people working, if you have an aging population, if you have lower incomes than the rest of Canada, your revenues are not going to suddenly just shoot up $145 million in one year, it's not happening.</p>
<p>The NDP have created a fiction in the past of a $1.4 billion deficit, they've misrepresented a $27 million amount last year; there has been a series of things that have shaken the confidence of Nova Scotians. My question to the minister is, given the track record of fiction and failure, how can Nova Scotians trust any numbers that come from the NDP now?</p></speech>

            <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, through you to the member for the question. I'm very sympathetic to the challenges that the forestry industry has been facing. Part of that has been that those western lands have been tied up. One of the first orders of business for me, when I came in as minister, was to encourage the management development process to be expedited within the department. Our hope is to have that process finalized in the new year and have people cutting wood on those lands early in the new year.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, we were able to table a balanced budget today because when we came to government we consulted with experts, we talked to Nova Scotians, we developed a multi-year plan and we stuck to that plan. The results of that plan are here today; Nova Scotia is on the brink of greater prosperity, we are turning the corner. I know, looking at the faces of the members of the Official Opposition, they have a very hard time accepting that prosperity is in front of Nova Scotians. Something that is very sad.</p>

Real balance needs to be restored in the Valley and under this government, as I already said - and you know what, Mr. Speaker, 700 and more have given up and they have left the region. They've gone elsewhere to live, and to work, and to raise their families. Until we get the fundamentals back in balance rural Nova Scotians cannot expect a turnaround.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Education's announcement yesterday with regard to school reviews and closures came as a surprise to many communities. As part of the review process for West Richmond Education Centre, parents, educators, and students wrote to the Minister of Education asking for her intervention in a process they deemed was unfair. The Minister of Education refused to meet with them and only responded once a decision was made to close the school. Yesterday, however, the minister said she is now listening to parents and communities affected by school closures. So my question is, why did the Minister of Education not address the concerns raised by parents and students of the West Richmond Education Centre before the Strait Regional School Board voted to close it under her flawed review process?</p>

            <p>As the honourable member knows, the Minister of Education cannot get involved in the review process, it is under the school board.

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>After communities, parents, and teachers have been put through the wringer by this NDP Government, grappling with $65 million in funding cuts to public education, and hundreds of hours of stressful school reviews the minister swept in doing an about-face and telling communities their work and stress was all for naught. When I asked during Question Period, almost a complete year ago, April 11, 2012, about intervening in the review process for West Richmond Education Centre the minister replied, "&#x2026; under the legislative process the school review is very clearly mandated and it is not to be interfered with by the minister. The school review process is a very clearly articulated process where parents and community have the opportunity on two separate occasions to offer their input to the process and to the board."</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a pretty glowing review of a process that the minister said was flawed just yesterday, so my question to the minister is, West Richmond Education Centre is slated for closure this June, will the minister tell us what will be the future of this school in light of her announcement yesterday?</p></speech>

That is why I have asked the school boards to suspend any future school reviews so we can work on a better process that clearly is not as adversarial as the one that we inherited.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Bill No. 8. I listened with intent at the words given by the critic, the member for Pictou West. When you have the benefit of having sat in this Assembly for 15 years, it also gives you the benefit of remembering what life was like under former governments. I would strongly recommend to the member for Pictou West, if she has the opportunity, that she speak to the House Leader for her caucus, for example, who served under previous Progressive Conservative Governments, or even talk to some of her former Leaders, who may be able to give her some information as to what the previous Progressive Conservative Governments did when it came to the issues of economic development.</p>
<p>What's ironic is that it was a Progressive Conservative Government that created Nova Scotia Business Incorporated. When they did so, they transferred all of these funds - there was the old Industrial Expansion Fund - over to NSBI, and within a year they took it back. So it's interesting to hear now the Progressive Conservatives saying how everything should be transferred to NSBI and that the Jobs Fund should be transferred to NSBI.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, now that we have the Auditor General's Report, the Auditor General has clearly identified significant issues with the Jobs Fund. If we were to do what the Opposition is asking us, we're basically just sending over a program and funding that the Auditor General indicated significant concerns with as it was administered by the previous government.</p>
<p>As I indicated earlier, we've undertaken a third-party review which will be underway very shortly, we hope, which is going to look at all of the tools that we use, and not just this fund. We want to look at the tools being used in Innovacorp, that are currently being used by NSBI, and what is available within the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism - and all other incentives that may be available, as well, to see if they are working properly and if we are getting the best value and if this is the best means to be able to attract and help grow business here in this province.</p>
<p>It was with interest that I heard the member talking about the issue of high taxes. Obviously we are very concerned with that, and we indicated that, which is why I'm very pleased that our Premier is giving instructions to undertake a full, comprehensive tax review. We've seen the impact that having some of the highest taxes is having on business, having on families, having on Nova Scotians, and we are hoping that review is certainly going to be able to identify changes that we can make to allow Nova Scotia to have a much more competitive environment. So obviously those are things that we want to do and I obviously share with the member the concerns that all Nova Scotians indicated about the past practices of the previous government.</p>
<p>We now know, and with the Auditor General's review, where unfortunately he did not indicate that under the previous administration such decisions that involve, whether it be Scanwood - I believe the member mentioned in her remarks - or other such large enterprises, those decisions were made in the Premier's Office. They were not made within the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. For the most part they were actually being negotiated directly by the Premier's Office, not by civil servants but by political appointed staff in the Premier's Office.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians expressed great concern with those types of investments, with the fact that they didn't clearly understand why so much money was being invested, what were the terms and what was the expected outcome, which is why, Mr. Speaker, as committed during the campaign, the first bill that I brought forward as minister was an Act to ensure accountability and transparency in financial transactions here in this province. Nova Scotians, from the comfort of their home, regardless of where they are sitting, can just go in front of their computer, click on a Web site and be able to see exactly where our government is investing their money.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, no other Canadian province is currently providing that type of transparency. So I certainly hope when the debate comes on that bill, we are going to hear from the Opposition as to what their position is on this Act of transparency and accountability for our province.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the issues that we are getting confusing messages on from the Opposition - and I know they love to use the word flip-flop, as if it hasn't been overly used in politics enough, the member referred to it again - but I'm getting confusing messages from the member and from her Party. In one sense the Leader said that this bill would call upon us to give all - as it exists - the Jobs Fund to NSBI because they are an arm's length agency and they should be making decisions, but earlier today in Question Period the member for Pictou West criticized our government for helping a Nova Scotia company when the deal was done and approved by the Board of Nova Scotia Business Inc.</p>
<p>I'm slightly confused as to what the position of the Official Opposition is and whether her Leader has a different opinion than what the honourable member might have, but you can't bring in a bill and debate a bill saying give all the funding to NSBI because they are arm's length and that is who should be doing business and then turn around in Question Period and say, well, we don't like what NSBI did on a specific business. Which one is it? And to try to turn it around and to say your government has done a bailout by helping a Nova Scotia company on the recommendation of Nova Scotia Business Inc. with the approval of the board.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about flip-flops, I've got to tell you that certainly seems to fall in that category where the Opposition, in day two of Question Period, is sending confusing messages already. We certainly are big supporters of Nova Scotia Business Inc. Today just before Question Period I had the opportunity to meet with the board personally and to thank them on behalf of all Nova Scotians, certainly on behalf of the Premier and our government, for the work that they do.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, these are men and women who have various backgrounds and have been very successful in our province, who are giving of their time to help review business transactions, and to give advice to government. But we can't have it both ways, having the Opposition tell us that is who should be doing all economic development for the province and then have the Opposition come in and say, well, we don't like this one. That was a bailout.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I would be curious whether the member for Pictou West is going to contact the two other private investors and ask them whether they believe that the investment they are making on behalf of their clients is a bailout, and if that is what they are going to report to their investors, that we gave money to this company to bail it out. I highly doubt that that is the rationale that went into the decision by two other private partners to put more money into this specific business.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, this obviously is an issue that we've been working on. Right off the bat, let's talk about the Ivany commission, again a commission with distinguished Nova Scotians who have taken time out of their busy lives to go around our province, to hold public meetings, to speak with stakeholders about the challenges facing the economy of Nova Scotia. We look forward to that report, which we're hoping should be available to us in early 2014, to hear exactly some of the suggestions that they are going to have. Hopefully they will be indicating to us specific areas we should be focusing on, as a province, so that we ensure that we are doing everything possible to help grow our economy.</p>
<p>But Mr. Speaker, I guess if I didn't make it very clear, we do not support Bill No. 8 in its current format and, as I indicated earlier, the Jobs Fund as it currently exists will be no more, so asking us to send over a fund that the Auditor General has indicated serious concerns with and that we've now indicated will no longer exist, obviously we cannot support Bill No. 8.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a sense of optimism in our province. I would hope that the member for Pictou West and her colleagues share in that optimism where communities, businesses and organizations truly do believe that there is a bright future ahead for our province. They do believe, and certainly with the support of our new government, that we are going to be able to move forward and work with the different Nova Scotia entrepreneurs, whether they are small business, medium business, large business, work with organizations and work with communities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians have expressed a great deal of confidence in our Premier and they have rewarded him with a majority government. We take that very seriously. At the same time allow me to state very clearly that we are prepared to work with all members of this Legislature. I know there was some discussion yesterday about changes made here in the House around Question Period. In my 15 years of elected office, having been in government and in Official Opposition and in Opposition, never before have I seen a government allow the Opposition to have a full two hours of debate on Opposition Day. I think that's a sign of how we're doing things differently under our Liberal Government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians asked for change and we are going to be delivering that change. As I indicated, in our own department we are undertaking a review of all the tools that we use, but certainly this bill speaks specifically to one, which is the Jobs Fund, and, as I indicated, that fund as it currently exists will no longer be in its current format.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, with the bill I introduced yesterday, we will make all of the transactions that we do as a province and making investments on behalf of taxpayers, with their hard-earned money, available on-line for all Nova Scotians to see. It was interesting because when we discussed this idea and said what's being done in other jurisdictions, let's see what they're doing, unfortunately for us - and fortunately at the same time - is that nobody else is doing it. We will be pioneers here in Nova Scotia for a province to be putting that information on-line, available for all Nova Scotians to see so that Nova Scotians, when decisions are made regarding investments made with their money, they will have access to that. It won't require a freedom of information request, it won't require the press to go running to find it. We will be posting it on-line within 30 days of that transaction taking place.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the other pieces of that is that any amendments that are done on those deals will also be posted on-line. Now that's important in two ways. First of all, in transparency, that will be available, but let's also remember that the previous government made changes to the legislation so that any amendments they were doing did not have to be disclosed. So this is an even bigger step for us to not only say are we going to change the practice of the previous government when it comes to amendments being made but we're going to put it on-line for all Nova Scotians to see, for Nova Scotians to judge.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, how much longer do I have?</p></speech>

<p>What's even more cute about the minister's statement is while she's asking for a halt to the school review process going forward, she has as well asked for a halt to any school closures that were done last year. The decision to start doing the review of the closure of West Richmond was done in 2011, that is when it started, the vote was last year.</p>
<p>The community, which was ignored previously by the minister, is asking today, will the Minister of Education indicate whether West Richmond Education Centre will close in June or will it not, as a result of her directive given to school boards yesterday?</p></speech>

More than 4,000 people have left Cape Breton in the past four years, in search of a better deal. With job vacancies at an all-time low, who can blame them?</p>

ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, parents, teachers and students have been telling the Minister of Education for the past three years that her cuts have been having a detrimental effect on the public education system, resulting in teacher cuts, program cuts and school closures. The minister says that she has asked school boards to halt review processes because of what she was hearing from parents and communities. But this minister has been hearing from parents and communities for the past three years about the damage that her deep cuts are causing in our classrooms.</p>

I have to say that they're doing a fine job. Some of the classes I visited had three students per teacher, so they're getting a fine education in Yarmouth.</p>
<p>At the end of the review process - it was March 31<sup>st</sup> - we let the process go through to that end before I asked the school boards to suspend. I must say that I'm looking forward to our coming year in education because we have the lowest student-teacher ratio under this budget that this province has ever seen.

          <speech by="#d2209e4d-eae1-410c-8dfa-b4444f1e67be"><from>MR. SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know there is a great amount of enthusiasm around re-establishing the ferry. I had the opportunity to speak to the Tourism Industry Association of Nova Scotia and I know that it was extremely well-received. In fact at one of the receptions I got to meet Mayor Pam Mood, the Mayor of Yarmouth. I had spoken to her on the phone but it was my first chance to see her in person. Needless to say, she is quite enthusiastic and quite happy on behalf of the residents of the Town of Yarmouth to see that service being put back in place.</p>
<p>We are working strategically with our partners in rural communities. We are creating higher-quality products and experiences. We will be improving signage throughout our province in support of our important tourism industry.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier with the Jobs Fund, the review done by the Auditor General confirmed our worst fears when it came to the types of investments being done by the previous government. The deficiencies that were identified in the program were alarming. Allow me to state once again that the majority of the deals that the Auditor General identified were not negotiated by the civil servants within the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism - they were negotiated in the Premier's Office by politically appointed staff. That is what happens when you have those types of decisions being negotiated in the Premier's Office.</p>
<p>I want to say that ever since I stepped foot into my department, I have been extremely impressed with the professionalism, the dedication, and the determination of the staff within the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism to help grow our province and help move our province forward. I want to say to all of them that I'm extremely proud not only to be their minister, but to work with them as we move this province in the right direction.</p>
<p>I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker - as you are probably aware, and as the Premier has indicated - the Premier took time out of his busy schedule to come meet the staff of my department. Because of the amount of staff and the office structure, we basically had to have two gatherings to allow him to come to speak and meet with the staff. The feedback has been incredible. One of our employees with 20 years of experience said, I've never met a Premier before, and I've worked for governments for 20 years. The fact that the Premier reached out and came and personally shook their hands, thanked them for their service to the Province of Nova Scotia, and asked them to work with us in growing our province sent a tremendous message. It showed great leadership. It's something the Premier has done in departments throughout government, which I know he will continue as he goes throughout the province, because of the fact we have civil servants who work in every area of our province.</p>
<p>That is the type of optimism that we're seeing from the civil service, it's the type of optimism we're hearing from chambers of commerce, it's the type of optimism I saw at the Tourist Industry Association of Nova Scotia, and it's the type of optimism that we are going to harness and work with all of our stakeholders and all Nova Scotians to move this province in the right direction to ensure prosperity in our province.

The minister's predecessor stood out in front of quite a lot of people outside the Legislature and said that this government would reduce clear-cutting by 50 per cent. When he became minister, he said the same thing, and then he brought forward a definition of "clear-cutting" that is so ridiculous that it basically allows anything.</p>

It's interesting, though, that the minister forgot to mention how optimistic those individuals who were fired by the Premier are feeling at this time of year, close to the Christmas holidays. Merry Christmas from the Liberals.</p>
<p>This bill being introduced by the PCs highlights some very important information. While in Opposition the Liberals said over and over that they would change the way government interacts and assists business in Nova Scotia. How short do the Liberals think the memories of the people of Nova Scotia are? During the election, what did they tell people? We're not going to give money to corporations. I heard that. I was at the doors, and people said, well, the Liberals are not going to give money to corporations. So we got one of those flip-flops immediately.</p>
<p>Even though this is not a government bill, it does blatantly point to the fact of how many times they have flip-flopped back and forth within their first 50 days of government. They called for all sorts of reform in economic development; they said that Cabinet shouldn't be involved in making decisions around corporate loans; and they said that they would not give to corporations. You can't be any clearer in your message - we will not give to corporations. And yet that has changed already.</p>
<p>The minister referred to the Auditor General's Report, but he forgot to also mention that the Auditor General actually was against and discouraged the Cabinet being involved in these decisions. So what is different? That is what I ask. What is different is when they were over here they just said the words, the perceived political words that would get them over on the other side. That's what it was all about.</p>
<p>Then they talk about they came forward with this wonderful bill of transparency - well, that information has always been available to Nova Scotians. I have to agree that it makes it much easier if you can click a button and you can see the information there, but it's going to be very interesting to watch what type of information gets put on-line. We have things called the Privacy Act. We have businesses in major competition with each other and it's very challenging, they don't want all their information to be out. So are they going to deter the interests of major corporations coming here? But what does it matter if they deter that interest? They said they were not going to give any money to corporations.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you put the information on-line to make it transparent. The true reality is the Liberals said, we are not giving money to corporations. The point is not at all about whether it's transparent, the point is the fact that on this side of the House they said over and over again that Cabinet should not have control. Cabinet should not have control, but when we get elected, we are not going to give money to corporations. You know what? Nova Scotians know that and they will remember that.</p>
<p>This bill does deal with who should administer programs. Granted, perhaps it's an interesting question, but you know where our concerns are? Our concerns lie with the jobs and the strategies going towards jobs. It will be fun to watch to see how well they do. It will be; they are now in the position of pressure to see how well they do.</p>
<p>It's also interesting to look at the fact that it wasn't that long ago that the members of this House, in particular the member for Richmond, will remember the whole issue with the families and the businesses in the Strait area while they were holding their breath about the issue and concerns of the Port Hawkesbury Paper and the support that they needed - a great deal of support. It wasn't just only about the jobs of those in the plant, it was about the jobs in the community because it has a domino effect and it trickles down if people are losing their jobs in a major plant. But did we hear much from the minister at that time? Very little.</p>
<p>There was no rallying to help the people in that area; there was no rallying to put money in that plant to allow people to have a job and make a decent wage for their family. There was no support; it was silent. The reason I focus on that is because we have to ask: would NSBI have made the same decision? We knew at that time it was the right decision to make and it was a quick decision that had to be made, and it was successful because that plant now has turned around and that community has turned around because of the support that we gave when we were in government.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter, all that I say here today because once again I just have to remind Nova Scotians the fact is it was less than 50 days ago that there was an election and it wasn't that long ago in the Spring sitting of this House that the Premier that we have today and the minister that we have today said very loud and clearly, we will not give money to corporations. If you don't understand what that means, please repeat after me, we will not give any money to corporations. So I guess what the Liberal election slogan was all about when they said about trust, I guess what they really meant was trust us to flip-flop. Trust us to flip-flop. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p></speech>

I think he's just committed to defining it out of existence. There are hardwood harvesters who are very excited about this possibility and the opportunity to get in there. There were many, many people in Nova Scotia excited about this, but instead the NDP definition that he introduced basically means it isn't a clear-cut as long as there is one four-foot-tall tree every eight feet. I don't think that qualifies as not being a clear-cut in anybody's definition.</p>
<p>In fact, let me quote the Ecology Action Centre's comments on it. "A weak definition: The once promising policy has been sidelined by a weak definition of what <i>doesn't</i> constitute a clearcut that essentially boils our forests down to the pulp industry's lowest common denominator."</p>
<p>Once again, they've thrown the hardwood producers and foresters under the bus. Why has the minister failed to deliver on the reforms as he articulated them to the public?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4fbcc786-c835-4a0e-bd05-40afb30e0683"><from>MR. PARKER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I didn't see during the Liberal Administration in the 1990s any definition of "clear-cut." I didn't see during the Progressive Conservative time in office up until 2009 any definition of a "clear-cut." In fact, they just let it go on and on - 96 per cent of our lands were clear-cut. Where was the Liberal or Progressive Conservative solution?</p>
<p>The truth is, we have the most aggressive clear-cut reduction strategy in all of North America. We're going to reduce it to 50 per cent. Our definition is based on science. It's based on consultation. It's based with working with the industry, working with woodlot owners, and working with environmental groups, and it will reduce our clear-cutting to no more than 50 per cent.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, using as an excuse that somebody 20 years ago didn't do something is not good enough for Nova Scotians. The member behind me was in the first couple of years of elementary school during the time that this minister is complaining about. If that's the best answer that this minister has, maybe he shouldn't be a minister anymore.</p>
<p>Any plan, including the Natural Resources Strategy, specifically was the idea to move toward uneven-aged management of the forest, which would have meant success in our hardwoods, success in our pulp industry, and success in many forest industries. The definition that this minister has allowed to go forward will mean the end of the forest industry in Nova Scotia - the end of a diversified forest industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we know the last minister was shuffled out of his position because he was in favour of doing something, so why hasn't the minister fully endorsed this forest management model so that standing forest ecosystems remain in place following harvesting?</p></speech>

The truth is that our Natural Resources Strategy is based on science, it's based on an ecosystem-based forest management. We're diversifying our forest industry for the first time in this province in decades, and it's going to create thousands of good jobs, it's going to protect the environment, and it's going to be a sustainable forestry of the future.</p>

          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Minister of Energy.</p>
<p>In the 2012 Speech from the Throne, on Page 14, it said "&#x2026; continuing plans for the opening of the Donkin mine while creating more Cape Breton jobs will move Nova Scotia closer to the secure energy future we need and deserve." I will table that, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>In the 2013 Speech from the Throne there was no mention of the Donkin mine. Will the minister confirm that Donkin is still a priority for this government, or have they broken yet another promise and let the people of Cape Breton down once again?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4fbcc786-c835-4a0e-bd05-40afb30e0683"><from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, certainly creating good jobs in rural Nova Scotia and in Cape Breton is an important goal and objective of this government, and certainly the Donkin mine has real potential to create more than 300 good-paying jobs in Cape Breton, as the honourable member would know.</p>
<p>The sale process is underway with Xstrata and they've been seriously trying to find a buyer. I know they've been working with Morien Resources as well, so we're optimistic that there will be a workable coal mine in Cape Breton in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia Power has forecast that coal will remain necessary for power generation until at least 2040. Nova Scotians are fed up with paying for more expensive foreign coal, as the minister is so fond of saying, being brought into the Province of Nova Scotia to generate power, and Cape Breton workers are fed up with having to leave families and loved ones behind to head west to find work.</p>
<p>Will the minister detail what conversations his government has had with Nova Scotia Power regarding using the Donkin mine to supply coal for power generation?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#4fbcc786-c835-4a0e-bd05-40afb30e0683"><from>MR. PARKER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I do know that the process is ongoing. The environmental assessment is well underway and will be completed early next year. The process of discussion between the partners, between Xstrata and Morien Resources, continues. I know there has certainly been discussion with Nova Scotia Power on clean technology, on how best that coal can be used.</p>
<p>This government is working hard to get off fossil fuel resources. Renewable energy is an important part of our future, but we also know that coal is still the major source of energy in this province, and while we're working towards renewables it will continue to be an important energy source into the future.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the minister just mentioned that they're working hard to get off fossil fuel for an energy source in Cape Breton, yet in his own Throne Speech he said we need to move forward with the Donkin mines to secure an energy future that we need and we deserve in the Province of Nova Scotia - so what way is it? We have one of the highest unemployment rates in Canada - it's 17 per cent in Cape Breton. We've lost 1,000 full-time jobs, more than 4,400 people who have left and decreased the population of Cape Breton in the last three years. Will the minister finally admit that this government has failed the people of Cape Breton and has done nothing to help this region?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, it must be getting late in the day, I guess. I've said all along that diversification of our energy portfolio is important, and that includes wind energy, and tidal, and sustainable biomass, and hydroelectricity, and certainly natural gas, and coal. We need a variety of sources; we can't be like past governments who relied solely on one source, one time it was oil then it became coal, but coal is still an important part of the mix for the energy needs of this province.</p>

          <speech by="#d6c0c78d-dcf3-456a-915c-a20ecb33050f"><from>HON. JOHN MACDONELL</from><p>I move that Bill No. 32 be now read a second time. Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to begin debate on amendments to Bill No. 32, the Solemnization of Marriage Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, weddings are as unique as the happy couple and those who celebrate with them, but they all have one thing in common, they aren't official without a marriage licence. Unfortunately, the process to get one in Nova Scotia is more complicated than it needs to be and that's why we've introduced amendments to the bill, the Solemnization of Marriage Act, to make the process easier for Nova Scotians who are planning to marry. Right now, our legislation requires couples applying for a marriage licence to make two separate trips to the licence issuer, once to apply, and five days later, to pay and pick up the licence. This can be inconvenient, especially for people in rural areas, who may have farther to travel to apply for and pick up a licence.</p>
<p>Since 1931, we've required Nova Scotians planning to marry to request a licence in person, wait five days, and then return to pick up the licence. We believe that this wait period was intended to force sober second thought. Mr. Speaker, while this requirement may have served a useful purpose at one time, Nova Scotians no longer need government to play this monitoring role. We are responding to the need for Nova Scotians to have efficient and convenient access to government services, while respecting that adults do not need a government-forced period to think about their marriage. Nova Scotia is the last province in Canada to still have the wait period, and this change brings us in line with other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, eliminating the five-day wait and a second visit to a marriage licence issuer will also be more efficient for government. With the new process, applications that now sit on someone's desk for five days or more can be closed in 15 minutes, and that kind of efficiency is good for everyone. By bringing forward changes, government is making life better for thousands of Nova Scotia couples who marry each year, by reducing the administrative burden at a time when their focus should be on the joy of starting their married lives together in this great province.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, I'll take my place, and I look forward to further debate on the bill.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#bc54523e-7553-4c28-b315-79d18165339b"><from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to begin to speak on this bill to amend the Elections Act. I know that every member in this House is familiar with the past year and the issues that arose from the uncertainty of when the election would or would not be called. This Elections Act is intended to address that issue. I know that this bill, I believe, was brought before the House several years ago and again we would bring it before the House.</p>
<p>I would like to just talk about some of the circumstances in the past year. Some of you will realize that some people were nominated up to two years before the election. In fact I know members of our own PC caucus who spent the better part of the past year going door-to-door in election mode. We had at least three occasions in which it looked like an election was going to be called. In one circumstance I know that one of our PC candidates rented an office about five or six months before it was necessary and actually had incurred the expense of having that office unnecessarily for that length of time. All of these inconveniences were apparently to convenience the government of the day - our past government - who used the tool of tinkering with the election date as a political tool to try to get a more favourable circumstance, not realizing that both the public and the media had grown weary of the game and it actually worked against them.</p>
<p>That indecision on their part led to all sorts of circumstances in your life and in my life. One circumstance for me, personally, was we had a wedding to go to in July, a young man in Belgium. The young man had been a Rotary exchange student in our home 10 years prior and we had booked that trip that week to go to Belgium for a wedding, his wedding. This young man had a big impact in our lives. We had promised him that when he got married we would go to his wedding and 10 years later we fulfilled that promise but, having booked that trip, I wasn't certain whether I would be able to go or not.</p>
<p>The results of that young man having come into our home 10 years ago was that we consequently got involved in the Rotary Club and since then have had two exchange students from Madrid, Spain, in our home, an exchange student from Thailand in our home, an exchange student from Japan in our home, an exchange student from Holland in our home, and also two of my four sons were privileged to be exchange students, one having gone to Brazil - I forgot to mention that we also had a young man from Brazil also in our home. But my oldest son was able to go to Brazil for a year as an exchange student and my third oldest son was able to actually spend a year in Belgium, in the same area where this young man had come from. Consequently, we were able to visit him several years ago also.</p>
<p>Going to this wedding was an important milestone in my family's life and not knowing if that election would be called sort of cast a shadow over that. We felt relieved when it finally came and went and we were successfully able to go on that trip.</p>
<p>I'm sure that all of you would have similar stories about the uncertainty around the election date. Not only did it present difficulties for you, as candidates, but also for volunteers. I had my campaign manager who had company coming for the whole month of August and, as a result of that, we acquired, we picked up a co-campaign manager because of that issue. So for not knowing the date of the election, it caused us multiple issues.</p>
<p>Not only that but it caused issues for Elections Nova Scotia. Elections Nova Scotia hires a number of part-time people for the period of the election and the difficulty for them is knowing when that period will take place and proper planning for that, so they would benefit from having more certainty in the process. Furthermore, I will point out that we are the only province that does not have this feature in our Elections Act. Every other province in Canada has a fixed election date, so we are the last province to be introducing this legislation.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that our members across the floor have said that they are quite proud of leading our country in areas of transparency and in other areas. I would like to suggest that being the last province in the country to adopt fixed election dates would be great, but it would be a shame on us if we can't get this done and get this through. Furthermore, as I mentioned already, it did not serve any good political purpose for the Dexter Government to tinker with this and raise the ire of the public and the media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I want to talk about issues that I had on my farm. As many of you know, I'm a farmer, I mentioned that the other day, and the busiest time of year for us on the farm is August/September. From about the 10<sup>th</sup> of August to the 25<sup>th</sup> of September is when we harvest our summer savory and we work very hard during that period. We have two men working on tractors out in the field bringing the savory in; two men, myself and another man, in the farmyard processing this product.</p>
<p>Not knowing the date of the election, we were hoping that we would get through that time period without having an election called. As all of you realize, the election was called in mid-September. At that point it wasn't expedient to try to replace myself. So during the election actually, for a good part, up until about the 25<sup>th</sup> of September, I was getting up in the morning and working on the farm from 6:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. and then going out door-to-door until dark, as all of you did. (Interruption) So did that help me? My good friend is saying maybe that didn't hurt my political chances but, nevertheless, it was a tough go and if we had simply had some certainty in that process of knowing when that election would be called, that would have been a great asset to me personally.</p>
<p>So not only is it important to us I believe as candidates, I do believe that it does not serve the government of the day any particular purpose in using the ability to manipulate the date, or to try to seek a better favour, and I think that it was obvious that the best before date on the previous government had already come. Maybe they weren't aware of it but the public was, and dragging out that process hurt them. I believe that it is a bill that we should pass. I know there is talk about modernization in government, and to me we're well behind the times if we have not modernized in this way.</p>
<p>So once again I would like to reiterate that it is again to say that we are the only province that has not enacted this legislation. I know that the Liberal Party, when they were in Opposition, brought forward this same bill, I believe some three years ago, for a fixed election date, and now we as a House have an opportunity to pass this bill and clear up this issue and bring us up to the standard of the rest of Canada, and to take this step into the modern world, into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. As it is, it is part of the past century, using the timing of the election to advantage the government of the day.</p>
<p>So I would like to again reiterate my support for this bill and to say that in our personal lives, in our campaign teams' personal lives, in the life of the province, in many different ways, this would benefit our province and would make planning for the election and would make all of those things easier. Furthermore, it would also assist the media. That was a familiar theme during the election that the media had also grown weary of this prolonged pre-election period and, again, in that sense, the ire of the media did not assist the government of the day in prolonging the calling of the election.</p>
<p>So again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that I believe that for many different reasons we should support this bill to modernize our Elections Act to set fixed election dates.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise today and be part of this debate on fixed election dates. I'm very pleased that the issue is at hand here today, because as members of the House know the Liberal Party had brought in a similar bill in the past. We had raised the same issue around getting in sync with the rest of the country and moving forward and really modernizing our approach to elections. In this instance, unlike the previous bill that was just debated, I think we'll find the government side of the House and the Progressive Conservative bill match - we're on the same page in this case and so I think that's a good start.</p>
<p>It's always a pleasure to rise and be part of the debates that take place in this House. There are a lot of times when we might vehemently disagree with each other to one degree or another and other times we do see where there's a meeting of the minds. Certainly, in looking at the notes that were prepared to remind me of this issue, the first point that jumps out at you is that we are the last province in Canada not to set fixed election dates or to set some parameters for that.</p>
<p>That being said, I did want to talk a little bit about the bill, itself, Bill No. 6, which sets out a fairly prescribed formula of when the date would be. It says quite clearly that it would be the second Tuesday of October every four years - so after an election is held it would be the next time we get to the second Tuesday of October. The problem with that that we see is that there is no flexibility around that, so in looking at this bill - and I do say, in principle we support this bill - we'd like to see a bill go forward that would have a little more flexibility built in.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that certainly we know our municipal elections always take place in October, and in Nova Scotia every four years we have municipal elections. The last one was a year ago, so it was 2012, but there are times when it might actually overlap and, definitely, September or October is the election time for the municipalities. And we don't have any control over when the federal elections are being held, so there is the possibility that a federal election could be underway at the same time.</p>
<p>What we really feel is that - and I'm sure members of the House would agree with me - there's a lot of confusion around different elections and who does what. If you had two elections running concurrently in an area, in a riding, I can just predict to you there would be a lot of confusion and I imagine even fewer might come out to vote, because they always say people are always at my door - either you never come to their door or they complain you're always at my door. I'm not sure which is the worst. I just think people would not be very receptive to having two elections running concurrently.</p>
<p>What we would like to see in a bill that would set fixed election dates would be to set a range of dates. Again, there was a little bit of acknowledgement about that in the bill because the bill does say, in the fourth clause, that the Chief Electoral Officer can choose another date if the actual day of the election would fall on the same day for municipal, federal, or our provincial one. But it says then the Chief Electoral Officer would have to choose one of the seven days following the Tuesday that would be the ordinary polling day, so it would mean you would have a separate election day but you would still have overlapping elections, the four to six weeks of campaigning would still be overlapping and we just feel that would be the wrong way to go about it.</p>
<p>I think when you're having an election it's really important to try to have people and the voters be able to focus on the issues, focus on what each Party is offering and what their platform is and have the opportunity to absorb that and be part of the discussion, to participate in candidate debates and so on. Having two levels of government having an election at the same time, I think would be a big mistake.</p>
<p>What we would be looking for - as I said, in principle we support the bill - would be amendments to this bill that would allow it to reflect either the ability to move to the next season, perhaps you move to the Spring, or move it into a range where you could say within a three-month period you might have that - as all of us being Canadians know we don't usually go to the polls in the middle of the winter. That's not a good idea, and if you've ever tried to hammer in signs in the winter, it's not good for anybody or for our volunteers which the member for Kings North, who introduced the bill, certainly had made comment of how important our volunteers are, and recognizing the time and commitment that they put in too.</p>
<p>So it isn't just about the Parties and the candidates; it's about all the people that are engaged in the electoral process, and each and every one of us, as we know, values the volunteers. We've heard a number of the inaugural speeches in the House, the replies to the Speech from the Throne, coming from new and returning members. Invariably people are so grateful for the time and financial support, and moral support that we get from people in our communities. That is an important thing to remember as well.</p>
<p>We didn't want to have any kind of an overlap on elections, so we'd just like to put in a safeguard for that. That would be very important. Madam Speaker, I had an opportunity to speak to our Leader as well, to the Premier, and I believe he has had a chance to speak to the Leader of the Official Opposition. I think it's a positive thing that there are times when we can reach across the floor of the House, come to an agreement and possibly see a bill pass from the Opposition bench and I think that's important.</p>
<p>I have spent 10 years in Opposition, and like other members of the House I have sat on both sides of the Opposition side. I know it can be very frustrating when you have good ideas, you've soundly researched them, you know they would be a benefit to the province, and they often fall on deaf ears. I may be wrong in saying that I don't believe there was a single Private Member's Bill passed under the four years of the NDP majority government. I don't know if anybody here can correct me - I'm sure maybe the Clerks know. Was there one?</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from><p>Madam Speaker, the Education Minister's request comes a day late and a dollar short - actually, it is $76 million short.</p>
<p>I see the minister over there laughing and I'll tell you, for people who have been through the school review process, it's not a funny matter, it's not a laughing matter. Madam Speaker, it's excruciating for these families, for these students, for the parents. If they were planning to do this, it should have been done well before now.</p>
<p>Parents whose schools have been saved are happy, but then they ask what's going to happen next, for how long has our school been saved? They have been put through the wringer by this process - and it's a process, I might add, that the Minister of Education for this government created. It is not somebody else's, it is their one. They made changes to it, they designed a new process and, yes, it was excruciating.</p>
<p>When you talk to board members, when you talk to parents, when you talk to students, they use words like "gut-wrenching" and "distressing" about this process. It's devastating for the families involved.</p>
<p>Talk to members of this House and if they have a school in their riding that has been through this process, it tears communities apart. I can tell you, Madam Speaker, we had a less divisive and yet incredibly divisive process for a boundary review in my riding that went on over two years, and the net result was that it has torn the community apart and there are people who aren't talking to each other because of a school boundary review - imagine what it's like when they start closing schools.</p>
<p>Yesterday the minister claimed this needed to be done because this was a flawed process, and yet it is that ministry's process, it's nobody else's. Now clearly on April 11, 2012, in response to a question from Michel Samson, the minister said we &#x2026;</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Ah, very good. Was it yours? Oh, very good. Was it a local bill? Perhaps it was a local bill. The reason I reference this - and if it was only one in four years that's very few - but I reference a time when Opposition was shut out. The majority government said, we'll do it our way, thank you very much, and we don't need your ideas, and we don't want to really engage in anything you have to offer. I think it's a counterproductive thing to do that. I think it's negative. I think it sends the wrong signal to the province, to the people of Nova Scotia, that when things are a good idea we should be able to reach out and do that.</p>
<p>I know minority government is an easier time to have that happen and my first two sessions in the Legislature, in 2003 to 2006 and 2006 to 2009, were minority situations in the House and I did have a number of bills passed. Not a lot, but there were bills from the Liberal benches passed. I'm very pleased that my bill to make booster seats mandatory passed - I think it was in 2005. And that one was a safety issue for children. That's one that surely we can agree on when we look at that. The Transportation and Public Works Minister at the time, to my surprise really, just said, that's a good idea, we've been looking at it, we think we should do it, let's do it. And my bill was passed. I think that sends a very good sign to all members of the House.</p>
<p>I mention that because certainly what we would like to see is a time when we can be productive. Again, I go back to the fact there will be times when there are strong disagreements between Parties, but I think when something like this is brought forward that has to do with modernizing our elections and bringing us on the same page with all provinces in Canada, there is a lot of reason to do that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I wanted to talk - I don't have very much time and I know how quickly it goes by - I did want to talk a little bit about the voter engagement. One comment that I'd like to make is that as we change the dates in the Act, it may be an opportunity to consider some other aspects of the Elections Act that could be modernized, some other things that we could add in that might be worth talking about today. As you know, all of us have come from an election period. We have official agents and others who have worked on our campaigns, and in fact a new Chief Electoral Officer in the last campaign. That was the first provincial campaign that they've been in charge of. There may be ideas that we should be rethinking, bringing back again and considering the introduction of.</p>
<p>I was mentioning to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism a committee that he sat on not that long ago, I think it was around 2008 or 2009, and that was an all-Party committee to review participation in the democratic process. That committee travelled around the province. They held meetings in different corners and different communities and spoke to people. They had staff support, there were notes taken, and there was a report written at the end of the day. I attended the session here at Province House - that was for the Halifax region - and there were some very interesting points that were raised. I remember particularly a number of academics who came to speak. They were academics at Dalhousie and other universities, who study political science, who look at voter engagement, and who consider ways that other places are doing better at getting people to participate and vote.</p>
<p>I haven't checked on this most recent election, but in my previous two elections, in 2006 and 2009, my area of Clayton Park - Halifax Clayton Park was the name at the time - had one of the lowest turnouts in the whole province. It was about 50 per cent in my riding, and in one of the elections it was the lowest. I think Halifax Needham came in very low, as well, in one of those elections. It's really sad when 50 per cent of the voters get out to vote in a provincial election and 50 per cent stay home.</p>
<p>I know it isn't for lack of a lot of activity on the ground and the campaigns being hard-fought, so there's something we're missing in that engagement with our voters today. I think civics is an issue that had come up, how we can engage more young people to be involved in politics through helping them know more about it, so that they don't say to you on the doorstep, I don't know enough about it, so I'm not going to vote. I'm sure we've all heard somebody say that to us, if not many people, during the election.</p>
<p>There's no reason in this day and age, with Google and the Internet and all the other myriad amount of information that's out there, that people would say that, but they do. So I'd like us to have a look at that report that came in about 2008-09 from that committee, to look at democratic engagement and the process in Nova Scotia and see if there were some other ideas.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it's interesting to note that the previous government, the NDP Government that sat here not very long ago, did nothing with that report. There was no effort to look at it or introduce any of the reforms that were in that report. I think in all seriousness, we should look, because a lot of Nova Scotians took time to participate, and it's an issue for all of us. We can't allow the amount of participation to continually erode.</p>
<p>I was impressed - I heard the new member for Pictou West reference in her opening speech 70 per cent or over 70 per cent participation, and that would be the highest in the province, or one of. That's really encouraging, but wouldn't it be nice if all the ridings in Nova Scotia had that kind of participation? A smaller community gets better engagement, no question.</p>
<p>We'd like to look further at this bill. I really just wanted to signal that we have an interest in looking at this bill, provided it had amendments to perhaps extend it to a few other subjects in the Elections Act, and also to make provisions for flexibility around the date.</p>
<p>With that, Madam Speaker, I know my time has elapsed, and I thank you for your time.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#a48067d1-5e84-46e6-907e-76a541767728"><from>MS. REGAN</from><p>Oh, sorry, the member for Richmond - the Minister of Education said under the legislative process the school review is very clearly mandated and it is not to be interfered with by the minister. The school review process is a very clearly articulated process where parents and community have the opportunity on two separate occasions to offer their input to the process and to the board, but over the span of a year the minister changed her tune.</p>
<p>The fact is that move should have happened long before now. It would happen under a Liberal Government as part of a review of public education. But now the minister tells us she doesn't have the power, so she has asked the boards. First of all, she couldn't interfere ever; now she has asked them.</p>
<p>Yet, in 2006, the Progressive Conservative Government was able to step in and stop the process. So you have to ask, what happened between then and now? She made her ask two days after the deadline for school boards to make those decisions, and that's why I said it's a day late and a dollar short. Two days later - and you have to ask, why then? Why put all those communities through that angst?</p>
<p>This government has cut $65 million from education over three years. It will cut another $11 million with the budget that was tabled today. We warned the government what would happen if they cut this kind of money from public education. We warned that schools would close. They chose not to listen. So you have to ask, what are those cash-strapped boards - which initially cut money from administration, and then cut teachers - supposed to cut now?</p>
<p>The minister says there's no more money, and in fact, there's $11 million less. On CBC today, one board said, well, there's one school that we're supposed to close, but to keep it open for another year, we have to put a new roof on. That roof will cost $100,000. What gets cut? Sounds like a teacher to me.</p>
<p>The fact is, this is a politically-motivated move that was made to save the bacon of the Premier, who was starting to take flack from parents and from boards for these cuts to education. That's where the blame lies. The cuts to education have devastated small communities. All you have to do is talk to people around the province, where they see their small schools go. I was talking to one just the other day, and what really galled him was that his school went through the process a year ago, so he's not covered under this. Or maybe he is. He doesn't really know right now.</p>
<p>It has been extremely adversarial when you pit different communities against each other, and that has to be laid at the government's feet. They chose to do this. They chose to cut money from education. They chose this particular process. They didn't stop it until the deadline had already passed. It's disrespectful to parents, who have been put through the wringer; it's disrespectful to students; it's disrespectful to boards; and it's disrespectful to all Nova Scotians to tell boards to stop this process now, and not give them any more money - in fact, to cut more money from education. It's a move that's born of desperation by a government that finds itself long in the tooth and short in the polls. And once again, this minister is trying to shift the blame to the boards, but the buck stops there.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#81ace0ab-54e7-4b6d-8d48-6d416fbcd939"><from>MR. GORDIE GOSSE</from><p>It's an honour and a privilege today to speak on the Progressive Conservative Bill No. 6, the Elections Act. My honourable colleague, who I was elected in 2003 with, pointed out some interesting facts. If you look at this year alone, we have three provinces that have fixed election dates in 2011, which means that the federal government will be going in 2015, along with the Province of Alberta, the Province of Manitoba, and the Province of Prince Edward Island. All of those three provinces are fixed election dates for 2011, which means that the federal government is going in 2011, the province is going in 2011, and you have municipalities in New Brunswick that are going in 2011.</p>
<p>You said that there could be two levels of government. There could actually be three: municipal, federal, and provincial - could you imagine the stress and the resources of political Parties and volunteers and constituencies to try to muster up three levels of government in a span of that time?</p>
<p>I notice you also pointed out that the provision in this bill talks about how they'll move it back seven days or so. You're absolutely right: if the fixed election date is the second Tuesday in October and they move it back a week, well, you could already be in a campaign for 30 or 35 days, which would mean that you are overlapping, you would be knocking on the door, running provincially, federally, municipally. Sometimes people in Nova Scotia just don't understand or seem to know what level of government you represent. We have such a low turnout in this province for young people who are going to the polls. I think that we have to look at fixing that aspect of it, too, getting young people involved, getting people involved in the election so we can get better turnouts here in the Province of Nova Scotia. Will fixed election dates help us get turnouts better in the Province of Nova Scotia? I don't think it will.</p>
<p>We're the last province in the country to look at fixed election dates. I think it is a step forward for us to do that but if you look in Parliament just recently, the honourable member for Clayton Park West, now the Minister of Finance, is absolutely right. We sat through a minority government in 2003, a minority government in 2006. What would have happened in that case if you had fixed election dates and the government fell and there was a vote in the House of Commons? Would the Lieutenant Governor come and say, I'm going to appoint another government because the Legislature is at a standstill? You know, that can possibly happen because bills are not getting done, the business of government is not getting done, in a minority government situation, which is absolutely right. They never lasted past the three years.</p>
<p>So if we look at that aspect of it in a minority government in the future - we may have minority governments again, we've had two just recently - if it does happen, you are going to look at if that government falls, what provision is there in this bill when the government falls? I don't see anything in either bill, the one that the Liberals introduced in Opposition and this bill here, that makes a provision for when a minority government, when that happens in a minority government, how do we look at that?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined"><from>Madam Speaker</from><p>I'll read something, :</p>
<blockquote>"[D]espite the apparent widespread support for the idea, fixing election dates under Canada's system of parliamentary government is no easy matter. Indeed, to truly fix the dates so there can be no possibility of government manipulation is impossible, at least not without a radical and probably unachievable reform of our parliamentary system. As well, while fixing the election dates might solve some problems, it could create others even worse. For that matter, there is some confusion about why the present system needs reform. Some people who call for fixed-date elections seem to be really arguing for a limit on the time that can pass between elections. However, such limits already exist. This, then, raises the question: What is the problem for which fixed-date elections are the solution?"</blockquote>
<p>Again, I say that the problems could be around minority government; the problems could be around making sure that we have the time there to do that. Like I said, we need to encourage people of all ages to vote. Voting is a very important part of democracy. Recently in Nova Scotia in 2008 we had the D250. We all can remember that, those that live here in a democracy. We celebrated 250 years of democracy - the longest serving democracy, I think, in Nova Scotia from 1758.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering about this bill. I mean it's apparent that we are definitely going to move, as the last province, into a fixed election date but in this bill here I don't see any meat on the bone in this one here. There would have to be some type of - there would be lots of amendments. If this bill were to move into the Law Amendments Committee, I'm afraid there would be so many amendments to look at all the different things. But there would be a lot of amendments and otherwise. In Section 29A(3) "&#x2026; the Chief Electoral Officer shall choose another day in accordance with subsection (4) and recommend to the Governor in Council that ordinary polling day be that other day, and the Governor in Council may make an order to that effect."</p>
<p>What I'm saying in the sense that if we have fixed election dates in a minority system and the government falls, does the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia decide who will be the governing Party of the province? Is that a possibility? Is that a possibility if a minority government happens? It would fall on the Lieutenant Governor's plate, I think, the way the legislation sits now. He would determine who would govern the Province of Nova Scotia because everything would be at a standstill.</p>
<p>We support this bill going forward and support any bill that comes forward with fixed election dates, but some of the issues that we have to look at - maybe before we discuss that, this bill should go to the Committee on Assembly Matters where we would have members of all sides of the House and the Liberal Party, the Progressive Conservative Party, and the New Democrat Party sit down and look at a good bill. Let's make it a very strong bill.</p></speech>

            <from>HON. DIANA WHALEN</from>
            <p>Is that the one that never met? Assembly Matters?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#81ace0ab-54e7-4b6d-8d48-6d416fbcd939"><from>MR. GOSSE</from><p>That's right, absolutely. I chaired that so I should have known it never met. (Laughter) It's interesting, and minister, I could explain why it never met because I couldn't get any co-operation on all sides of the House. (Interruption) I'm not going to point fingers there, there or here, but that is the Committee on Assembly Matters - and not that I didn't try for that committee to meet.</p>
<p>I think it's important when you're looking at changing election dates or doing that, is having Assembly Matters meet, with members from all Parties to sit down, and it would make it good for the Province of Nova Scotia and good for the voters to make sure that we do have fixed election dates. But make sure that we cover all the provisions in the Elections Act to make sure that we get it right. If we're going to do it, let's get it right the first time.</p>
<p>Canada's parliamentary system is based on not a separation of balance of powers but on a responsible government. Responsible government is about all members of the Legislative Assembly having a hand in making sure that we get it right. If we're going to do this, let's get it right. I guess why parliamentary Assemblies that have set election dates nevertheless provide some fail-safe measures to avoid such a deadlock like I spoke about.</p>
<p>I also talked to other parliamentary Assemblies, I've travelled quite a bit in the last three years to all the Canadian Parliamentary Associations and talked about some of the issues around fixed election dates and talked to members in Quebec who just recently passed theirs in 2012, talked to my friend the Deputy Speaker there, Fran&#xE7;ois Ouimet; talked to other members in Prince Edward Island, the Speaker there, Carolyn Bertram, talked about they're just moving into that; and Dale Graham in New Brunswick, the Speaker there.</p>
<p>I looked at what they felt, what was it like for them to go into fixed elections because we were the only province that didn't have it, and they said the problem with that, Gordie, is that we start campaigning two years out. The campaign starts two years out and if the fixed election date now is 2017 for the province, the campaign will actually start in 2015. It's not sitting around waiting about when the government's going to call the election, you're positioning yourself and you're starting the campaign almost two years out, so you're constantly in the mode of campaigning - which would probably be good for a lot of members in the Legislative Assembly to be on the doorsteps when there's no election.</p>
<p>That's what I like the most. I just don't canvass on election day, I canvass all the time. I canvass on Wednesdays and Saturdays and people are saying, what are you doing here, Gordie, there's no election for three years. I'm just here to see if you have any issues in the constituency; it's what I've always done. Waking people up on Saturday morning, no election and they don't know if it's a federal election, municipal - what's this guy doing on my doorstep? An interesting scenario, I had somebody say that guy knocked on my doorstep on a Saturday morning and there's no election, you know what? My wife and I didn't vote in the last election, but I'm going to vote for that guy just because he came here.</p>
<p>That's how you do things, you work hard as an MLA but I think that if we're going to do a bill like this, Bill No. 6, if we're going to look forward to doing this bill as the Election Act, there will be a lot of amendments in that, and I think that all Parties should sit down and say let's get this right. If we go in 2017 we won't have to worry about the feds, they're going in 2015; we won't have to worry about the municipality because they're going in 2016. So we're actually in a good rotation because 2015 will be the feds, 2016 will be municipal, 2017 will be the province, so we're in a good situation now. (Interruption)</p>
<p>Well, I just spoke about that, I'm not going to repeat myself on that. (Interruption)</p>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. EDDIE ORRELL</from><p>Madam Speaker, I stand in my place today on this very important issue in debate this evening - and I listened to the member opposite talking about how they're listening to the community.</p>
<p>We're getting closer to an election year, or we're in an election year, and that government is finally starting to listen. Last year, during first contract arbitration, we had the biggest employers in the province, we had everyday working people, we had Opposition people, we had all kinds of people in here talking about first contract arbitration and how it would affect people in the Province of Nova Scotia and how the people in Pictou County, the Sobeys and a few others in that area, the Michelins, came to the Committee on Law Amendments and spoke to their MLAs - but it's funny, they didn't listen then.</p>
<p>We heard all kinds of things that were going to happen that were going to hurt those businesses, and we were told by these businesses that they came to their local MLAs but it wasn't brought back to the table here. So they're listening now, when we're in an election year - they weren't listening then on different kinds of topics.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we're dealing with an awful situation here. Families, teachers, school boards, entire communities have been put through the wringer during this process. Difficult decisions have been made by good, honest, hard-working people - they've had to make gut-wrenching decisions, communities have been torn apart, and we know that these schools are a huge part of our rural communities.</p>
<p>The question I have to ask is what happens later. The school review process is delayed now, what happens later? What's going to be the overall plan? Are we going to redevelop the school review process, and how long is it going to take? What are we going to put people through the next time?</p>
<p>The minister's decision yesterday to ask the school boards to halt the review process seems to be nothing more than political posturing at the present time. We're doing it on the backs of the rural communities, we're doing it on the backs of school boards, and we're doing it on the backs of citizens. It puts these citizens in an awful position. Communities have been pitted against each other from the start, and this has dragged on for months now.</p>
<p>They say they're listening to all the boards - why not listen last year, when they were cutting the budgets, and the school boards were telling them what valuable programs and positions were going to be cut because of the budget cuts? What was their answer then? Send a consultant into places like the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board, let them help with how to do the cuts to their boards. So they listen now, but they were not listening then. The minister made it clear she has no legislative ability to halt the process, but she had the legislative ability to send in a consultant to help out at that time. Why not send a consultant in to help now?</p>
<p>We know that the boards and the communities cannot win in this situation. Whether they agree with the minister or they disagree with the minister, they're going to be the bad guys. The minister knows how cash-strapped our schools boards are from her $65 million cuts to the education system. The boards are struggling to keep rural schools open with limited funds.</p>
<p>So if this process is halted, power rates will keep going up, wages keep going up, cost of books, equipment repairs, et cetera. How do the boards deal with these inflammatory measures? If they keep the schools open, will the minister increase the funding to keep these schools open? Will they add more teachers to the system to keep the schools open? The minister has already admitted she has no authority. Her request was nothing more than a move in an election year.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, people of the Province of Nova Scotia don't like to see these election-year politics. Budgets, prepayments to universities that we said were immoral and wrong, happened in this budget today, we hear. There were cuts to education, and that's what put the school boards in the position they're in today. Now they're in an even more difficult situation, having to either stretch their budgets even further to keep the schools open or become a villain and say no to the request. That's not a position we like to put school boards or communities in.</p>
<p>The chair of the South Shore Regional School Board told reporters yesterday that the minister's request not to include school closures in the budget &#x2026;</p></speech>

<p>If you look at that, I think that we have to work together to make sure that we, as parliamentarians, do the right thing here, get this bill right, make sure we have fixed election dates.</p>
<p>How do you stop Parties from fundraising or collecting money, like - and there's another issue, when do you go out and start fundraising? Should I be out next week fundraising now for the next campaign in 2017? When do you build your war chest up again as a Party? When are you allowed to start - is that in the bill, when you're allowed to start raising money? Those types of things - when are you allowed to start campaigning?</p>
<p>As a former Speaker I remember when they first started about taking partisan advertisements - I notice that has been in the news lately (Interruption) Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. This was announced yesterday, but it was included in today's budget. We heard around the $27 million that there was no time to put it in the budget, in the forecast, the last time, but this was put in in a day. So this must have been going on for a lot longer than we know, and it's just a little more time to put the school boards through that process. The board chair on the South Shore Regional School Board went on to say that excluding school closures from the budget would be wonderful if they have the funding. I have a document to support that, and I'll table that.</p>
<p>We know funding hasn't increased. We know it's going to decrease. The Cape Breton Regional Municipality has to add about a million dollars to the Education budget, just out of their budget, because of the decreases. That's exactly the issue here. Boards are going to be forced to make cuts elsewhere. They fear they will have to make direct cuts to student programming.</p>
<p>Yesterday's request by the minister was nothing more than to boost the public image. They want to put the onus back on the school boards again. They have until April 30<sup>th</sup> to make this decision. What happens if they don't comply? Where do we go from there?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Nova Scotians deserve the truth. Nova Scotians impacted by this stunt can see right through this PR stunt.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the minister has reversed other decisions. For months, members of our caucus pointed out the need to lower the cap on classrooms. The minister fought our request for teacher-student ratios, she insisted that things were fine and the students were receiving all the help they needed, and we know what happened then.</p>
<p>Members of the caucus knew that wasn't true. Lo and behold, the minister was proven wrong and had to hire 73 more full-time teachers to address the needs of the overcrowded classrooms. It's doing things after the fact - classrooms were crowded.</p>
<p>We congratulate the minister for doing that, but there's no sense in putting people through that when you can do it beforehand, before the education year starts, so people who get used to being in classrooms don't have to go through the whole change again, especially younger children.</p>
<p>It's unfair that this request wasn't made before the school closure process, before these communities were ripped apart doing it. It's irresponsible of the minister to force cuts to have even more direct impact on students. It's unfair for the NDP to try to score political points by shifting the blame of school closures on cash-strapped school boards.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it seems to us, it looks to us, and it looks to the people of Nova Scotia like this decision has to do more with politics than it does with educating our youngest Nova Scotians. With that, I'll take my seat.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#eb42d545-c815-47c5-a60b-237f29603d3e"><from>MS. ARAB</from><p>This Friday marks the 24<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the massacre at<b> &#xC9;cole Polytechnique</b> in Montreal, Quebec. This was a tragedy that shook our country. Many of us remember hearing the news of the Montreal shooting, and while some of us were a bit too young and may not have understood the full impact of this event, we knew that it was a time when we held our loved ones a little tighter and for a little longer.</p>
<p>The 1989 tragedy also made our country and our society look at ourselves and question our values of equality and respect for our fellow citizens. The shooting in Montreal was an act of misogyny. There is no way around it. Mark L&#xE9;pine targeted his victims because they were women. He took the lives of 14 people because they were women.</p>
<p>We can thankfully say that this is a rare act and we have come a long way when it comes to women's equality in Canada and Nova Scotia. However, it is also important to recognize how far we have to go. December 6<sup>th</sup> marks the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. I am proud that our Liberal Government has committed to taking steps to address sexualized violence against women and will be developing a three-year strategy with the community to both meet victims' needs and do much-needed prevention work.</p>
<p>We are also committed to increasing core funding for community organizations that work with women who are victims of violence such as women's centres, transition houses and second-stage women's centres. We are also committed to investing in more affordable housing initiatives so that women and their families aren't forced to return to an abuser to keep a roof over their heads. We need to work with communities to find solutions that are practical and accessible to women and girls, and we also have to invite our men and our boys to be a part of the conversation on how to prevent violence. (Applause) We have to be ready to teach our children what a healthy relationship looks like and give our young people the tools to have healthy relationships and treat each other with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>Women in communities have been working to raise awareness about equality for years. Would December 6<sup>th</sup> be forever remembered as a tragic anniversary for our nation had we addressed this before? The question we have to ask is, how can we prevent tragedies like this from happening again? How can we end violence against women so that families don't have to get the tragic news that they won't be able to hold their sister, their mother, their daughter, their aunt, their friend, again. For the memory of the women who were tragically murdered in the Montreal shootings, for those women in Nova Scotia who have tragically lost their lives to violence, we have to take a stand. We look forward to working with all Parties to advance the equality of women and girls and put an end to violence against women.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#0f46e5e4-b06b-4b91-9e3a-5bd1cd63809d"><from>MR. LARRY HARRISON</from><p>Madam Speaker, members of the House know that in 1999 the United Nations designated November 25<sup>th</sup> as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. That day was marked this year by the Transition House Association of Nova Scotia with the announcement that the first Education Bursary from the Pamela Gerhardt Endowment Fund had been awarded. The intent of the Endowment Fund is to recognize and support women who have used Transition House services, to encourage and support their efforts to further their education, and to honour their struggle in overcoming the impact and the effects of domestic violence. Going back in my own career, in 1995 - actually around 1989, I'm sorry - we had what we called the Fire in the Rose program. It was a nationally funded program, and there were five places in the country chosen to do this. It was against violence, any kind of violence, but certainly violence towards women is what we really focused on.</p>
<p>Now, I know that all members of the House support this kind of program, whether it be the Fire in the Rose, Transition House, or whatever. It is certainly a wonderful legacy for Pamela Gerhardt and gives hope to women who have that experience. While December 6<sup>th</sup> is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the aim of that day is something that we should aim at every day of the year. (Applause)</p>
<p>December 6<sup>th</sup> is known as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. It does mark a very, very tragic day in our history. That's the day in 1989 that, again, Marc L&#xE9;pine executed 14 women. The National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women was established in 1991. Not only is the day meant to honour the lives of the victims of the Montreal massacre, it is an opportunity to reflect on violence against women and discuss ways in which we can all fight it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for far too many girls and women, violence is a sad reality and I've dealt with them; I've actually got some of them into the transition houses in my area. On average, every six days a woman in Canada is killed by an intimate partner. On any given day in Canada more than 3,300 women, along with their 3,000 children, are forced to sleep in an emergency shelter, just to escape that domestic violence. Every year in Canada up to 360,000 children are exposed to that domestic violence. Can you imagine what they must see and the example that must get shown?</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia we've very fortunate to have dedicated groups committed to ending violence against women and helping victims. Many of these groups belong to the Transition House Association of Nova Scotia. Their purpose is to work with each other, seeking organizations and the three levels of government, to address barriers that prevent women and their children from living free of violence and abuse. Because of these groups, there is hope for women who have been victims of violence and also for their children.</p>
<p>I note that the Liberal election platform promised to invest in transition houses and women's centres, starting next year. I am hopeful that this is an election promise that government takes very seriously because that funding is very much needed, very much needed. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#c479d7de-83a6-47c7-a045-07816407bdb3"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Madam Speaker, on December 6, 1989, a young man acting with a lethal combination of misogyny and a gun killed 14 innocent women in Montreal. Here in Nova Scotia, in Canada, and around the world, women, girls, youth, and very young children are subjected daily to many forms of violence. Sexism, bullying, abuse, cyber violence, racism, and pornography are just some examples. There is also a demand for graphic images of sexualized torture of women and children, which are obtained from users of the Internet. In fact, an incident happened here in Nova Scotia just in 2011. I refer, of course, to Raymond Lahey, the 71-year-old former bishop of the Archdiocese of Antigonish who, when caught at the airport in Ottawa, had hundreds of sexualized images of children and torture on his laptop.</p>
<p>Given that Healthy Relationships is a program that promotes awareness about the difference between violent relationships and healthy relationships, I believe that it is important for the Province of Nova Scotia to support this important program which, at the present time, is offered by women's groups and centres around the province. In particular in Antigonish, the women's centre there provides that to 10 different high schools. They feel that, at this point in time, there is not enough money to deliver the program properly right across the province. They say we need a trainer in each community to help train students so that they understand and fully integrate the education about what is abuse, what is cyberbullying, what is sexually accepted, and what is not accepted in society today. Kids today need to be taught by adults and oftentimes adults are abusing these as well.</p>
<p>Our NDP Government established the sexual assault interdepartmental action plan to help deal with the serious problem of sexual assault in our province. Our government was the first to establish something like this, and a lot of good work was done by many people over the past couple of years. However, I'm told that the sexual assault action plan is now on hold. So I can't urge the current government enough to take a look at this and please keep it going, and put some money and support into the women's centres across the province so that they can help the women and girls in our communities and help to train students to understand all of these important topics.</p>
<p>The women's centres that I've spoken to all believe that we need core annual funding for their centres in order for them to operate properly. Again, I would ask for this current government to please listen to that plea.</p>
<p>The other thing I wanted to say is that freedom from femicide and other forms of gender-based violence in Nova Scotia, Canada, and around the world has yet to be achieved, because some acts of violence that women endure continue to remain invisible. I speak here of torture perpetrated by private individuals or groups. These are called "non-state actors." For example, there was one woman in my constituency of Bible Hill who recounted such torture, and she was marginalized for over 25 years. She tried to tell people, and nobody listened. I have a copy of her story for those who would like to read it.</p>
<p>Also, I have a pamphlet written by two of my constituents, Jean Sarson and Linda MacDonald, who have written about non-state torture and the importance of us learning about this and its importance. We need to change the Criminal Code of Canada, they say, because at this point non-state torture is not recognized, and therefore the people who are victimized by such actions are not protected.</p>
<p>They say at present the Criminal Code of Canada is discriminatory in that persons - very young children, youth, or adults - who suffered from non-state torture from parents, husbands, mothers, other strangers, who they don't know if they've been kidnapped - they cannot seek justice for the torture that they've survived. The Criminal Code of Canada does not permit them equality under the law, because Section 269.1 only permits individuals who have been tortured by officials - meaning police, military, or representatives of governments - to seek legal redress for torture victimization.</p>
<p>I believe that the time has come to promote among our political peers the need for a private member's bill to be introduced federally that would modernize the existing provisions relating to torture in the Criminal Code of Canada, in efforts to eliminate legal discrimination and promote equal access to justice and redress. Without specifically identifying non-state torture as a crime in the Criminal Code of Canada, no criminal data identifying that such torture occurs can even be collected, thus disregarding the human dignity of persons who have suffered victimization.</p>
<p>In closing, I would just like to say that in this day and age, the fact that women and children are still suffering from violence, when young women's bodies are found stuffed in gym bags floating down a river in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and when young women are found in walls, in crevices, in the trunks of cars, something is wrong with our society. Something is terribly wrong and we need to teach our children respect for one another, for their parents, for women, girls, and children so that we can live in a safe society that is full of compassion, kindness, and love for one another.</p>
<p>I also believe that seeing adults such as ourselves, if we start to bully each other in the House and the kids come in to watch that, does not set a good example. I hope that all of us can listen to that and pay attention as we proceed with our proceedings. Thank you.</p></speech>
