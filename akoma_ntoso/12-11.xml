<p>Whereas it is important for Nova Scotians to have a conversation with their loved ones regarding their end-of-life wishes; and</p>

<p>Whereas today, April 16th, the Quality End of Life Care Coalition of Nova Scotia is participating in national Speak Up! Day, to help make Nova Scotians more aware of end-of-life care and ensure all individuals die with dignity and respect;</p>

<p>Whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can leave its sufferers unable to breath, causing intense anxiety and fear; and</p>
<p>Whereas Capital District Health Authority has created a new home-based program called Inspired, and its goal is to eliminate patient anxiety by teaching participants to administer their own medications, teaching relaxation techniques and ways to move the body while using less energy; and</p>
<p>Whereas this community-based treatment approach improves patient care while reducing health system costs, and has already reduced emergency department admission rates by 70 per cent for those enrolled in the program;</p>
