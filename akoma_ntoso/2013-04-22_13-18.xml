        </speech>
        <speech by="#58b01541-6697-4dbd-830c-6cec0d4c4825"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I think it's an important opportunity to rise when we speak into Supply. I think there are only two more days left of estimates, as the clock is ticking. We do four hours a day, as members of the public may not be aware, and a maximum of 40 hours are spent on the budget estimates.</p>
<p>One of the subjects that I hope to talk about today is that of residential tenancies and the rights of tenants and landlords as they relate to the services that we provide as a government. I have a particular interest in the rights of our tenants, because the area of Clayton Park West and Clayton Park has a very densely populated area, and we have a large number of apartment buildings, a large number of people who rent.</p>
<p>When you look at the statistics for the province - and they are broken down by riding - a lot of ridings have a high ownership level; 75 and 80 per cent ownership. But in my riding it is more than two-thirds of the riding that homes are actually apartment units.</p>
<p>In my last mail-out in the area, I had 10,000 apartment units and about 5,000 homes, so you can see there's a preponderance, a large number of people living in apartment units, and the issues around tenancy come up quite frequently. Mr. Speaker, I don't even know if I'll take the full 15 minutes on tenancies but there are a couple of points that I think are really important. I know that the government changed the tenancy Act a couple of years ago as one of the moves of the NDP Government, but there are still some areas that I think are lacking, some points and some teeth that are lacking in our legislation and I want to speak to a couple of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, from my experience and the reading I've done, it seems to me that New Brunswick has a better system than we have in place. They have a system in place called the Rentalsman; their office is not called the Residential Tenancies Board, it is called the Rentalsman Office. If you have damage in your apartments, if you have leaking windows or cracked windows, or roofs that are leaking, or you have mould, whatever the problem is that you have, you can report it to your landlord and if it is not addressed in a timely fashion, by telling the government office that this problem exists the government will send out somebody who fixes it and they charge the landlord back for that service.</p>
<p>You can be sure the cost of having the Rentalsman Office do the repairs is much higher than it would be probably if the landlord themselves had just dealt with the problem in the first place - so there's real teeth from the government perspective because, if something is wrong in your building and you don't correct it, you know that it's going to be looked after by the government themselves.</p>
<p>We don't have anything remotely like that here in Nova Scotia. If you have damage in your apartment units you have to appeal to your landlord, and continually appeal. If they don't do anything, you have to take it as a complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board, where a hearing is set and time is set aside - and you have to wait longer.</p>
<p>Remember, for a lot of people who are living in apartments that have damage, a $28 fee to bring your complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board is not insignificant; it can be a big cost. The tenant may not have transportation to get there; they certainly are not represented by any lawyers or corporate interests; and when they sit down at the tenancy board they have the people hearing their case and they also might very well be sitting next to the lawyer and the landlord, and the landlord's lawyer with him. So it's really like sitting down against very uneven odds when you're just an individual who rents an apartment and you are trying to get the right thing done that supposedly the laws allow you to do.</p>
<p>I think it's really wrong that we don't have any capacity within our government system to really enforce that certain rules are abided by, that landlords do take seriously the fact that they are supposed to provide safe and habitable places for rent; in fact, that is part of the opening our of Act, the Residential Tenancies Act begins by saying that the Government of Nova Scotia takes it seriously that we provide only safe and habitable places for tenants in our province.</p>
<p>My concern is that there are places out there that are not really meeting that standard and that we have no mechanism to step in and ensure that is changed and that the right thing is done. There are some jurisdictions, Mr. Speaker, that go so far as to actually require an inspection of apartments before they are rented. I think that is going a long way. I realize the cost of inspectors would be high if you actually had to inspect every unit to make sure they were safe and habitable before a lease is signed, so we leave a lot to the landlord. We trust the landlords to keep their buildings up and to keep their apartments in good shape, to address deficiencies and make sure there aren't major problems like mould or water leakage, or unhealthy environments.</p>
<p>Frankly, Mr. Speaker, tenants are very annoyed; tenants are still struggling and they feel overwhelmed by the forces lined up against them. We have to remember that a lot of people can't afford the cost of the home, I would say particularly in HRM, but I know the rental situation here and the cost of housing in the city. It may be true in other parts of the province, but I don't think we have the concentration of rental units that we have here in the city. The cost of buying into the housing market in the city is high and a lot of people for many years don't buy. Some people choose not to, they choose to rent. But, as I say, they are often disadvantaged in terms of bringing their complaints to the Residential Tenancies Board. They feel that the owners of the buildings have a lot more strength and power to respond than does an individual.</p>
<p>That takes me directly to a concern that I have, and I've raised it here. It was a bill that I brought to the House and I believe we've re-entered it because we began this session, as you may know, Mr. Speaker, by reintroducing all of the bills that were important to us. This bill relates to the rights of tenants. In my riding there is a building - in fact it involves a couple of buildings owned by the same owner, and the tenants had a common concern, a common complaint that they wanted to bring to the Residential Tenancies Board. If you can believe it, they were told to go back and individually bring them, one by one, bring their complaint and each person pay the $28. They were told that for legal reasons it had to be that each person has a lease with the landlord and therefore each one has to be dealt with separately. I brought a bill here to the House that says that tenants should have the right to bring a common complaint, because if there are 50 or 100 units in a building, it's very likely that they may share in a concern that has to do with common spaces or shared areas within the building.</p>
<p>So I think it's only smart, and it's even smart for the government, to hear one complaint because I know in this particular case - I think three or four people brought forth the common complaint. It is difficult for people when you tell them we all have to do it individually, but four people did it. They had to then set up separate meeting times. They actually had very different responses from their hearings, they got told different things. They were told to bring different information when they went, and it has been very confusing. They had the same complaint and they wrote the same kind of complaint down in their application and it just strikes me as a waste of government resources. It looks like a make-work project for people in Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations that maybe they want to keep the people who want to sit on these tenancies boards busier, or set up more times for them to meet, but it's really ridiculous. It's a waste of government money, and it's a waste of time and resources for the public.</p>
<p>I really feel strongly that there should be just one avenue. If you share a complaint you should be able to come together. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I think that there is an underlying reason for this, and I think there is every effort made to keep tenants from organizing. There is a real fear of tenants organizing and speaking with any kind of a common voice. I don't know of any tenants organizations in the province - I know that Dal Legal Aid will often take cases from unhappy tenants or tenants who feel, again, overwhelmed by the forces that are often lined up against them. Dal Legal Aid definitely knows of the issues and has tried to lobby for tenants but there is no group that tenants can join where they could actually sign a petition, or ask for some government change, and they're very, very disconnected within these buildings.</p>
<p>As I said to you in the beginning, Mr. Speaker, my riding has 10,000 apartment units and a lot of those buildings have more than 200 units in them - or many of them - a lot of them are around 100 each and they don't know each other. There isn't that sense of community that you would get if you lived in a neighbourhood with 100 houses and it is because people are more transient, often people haven't been there as long, the transient aspect, or perhaps they are older. There are many reasons why, but they don't know their neighbours to the same extend as a homeowner might and it's harder for them to organize.</p>
<p>I can tell you in the buildings where I've had complaints come in like that, Mr. Speaker, the tenants say that if they put up a notice and say we want to meet, or let's meet, or call me if you have a problem, the landlords take it down. They absolutely don't want people meeting. So they're not allowed to post notices; it makes it very hard to communicate with each other in a building.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the government can do something about this. The government has the capacity to at least allow tenants to join together with a common complaint. This is not going to bring the world down crashing around our ears. It's not anything that would undermine our current system. It's such a small change but it's something we need. The tenants in this province need that aspect that they could join together and bring a common complaint against a landlord.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of problems, as I said earlier, around the maintenance of buildings, even some of the newer buildings - and my area of Clayton Park, as you can appreciate, has many new buildings. We have some older stock but a lot of new buildings, and I'm very happy with the landlords who are local, who live in this area, who have family trust, if you like, who are growing and building their own buildings and taking care of them for the future, and their families are all involved in the management. They do a really good job.</p>
<p>We do have real estate trusts, big national organizations that are buying up some of these buildings. I'm sorry to say that they don't have the same commitment to reinvesting in the buildings and to helping people be in buildings that are taken care of. The rents are extremely high in this city. I don't have to tell members of this House that the $565 which we give for accommodations under Community Services doesn't begin to touch the cost of apartments in my area. A lot of them are $1,000 and more, and you would be hard pressed anywhere in my riding to find something under $700.</p>
<p>This is a major problem as well, that the rents are so high, and that those who are most needy - those on assistance or disability - are not given the help they need to find safe and habitable apartments. I believe the government has a responsibility to look at some other systems out there. I refer to our neighbour in New Brunswick that has the Rentalsman system, which I think would allow us to have at least a little bit of a stick, to say to landlords, if you don't fix it, we're coming in and doing it for you. That, I think, would spur the apartment owners to make sure they will do that.</p>
<p>Again, I want to be clear, I think some apartment owners are wonderful landlords. I do know that they're out there, and I've talked to tenants who would never move because they love the landlords. But we have to remember that others will be trying to get the most profit they can get out of the building, and not reinvesting to make sure that they are good landlords and that they're providing good apartments for the people who live there.</p>
<p>I would hope that even by having the opportunity to raise this today, that other members in government and the minister, hopefully, will look at this again, and look at the bill that I've raised that would allow common complaints from more than one tenant to be dealt with together, rather than separating them, dividing and conquering them, overwhelming them with the power of both bureaucracy and the large corporate forces that they're often faced with. We have no idea how intimidating that can be for individuals.</p>
<p>I think that as MLAs we should be alert to that. We should be trying to lobby for the tenants, just to try to set a little bit more of a balance in terms of the power balance that exists for landlords and tenants. I appreciate that tenants also have big responsibilities, and I think that most people really abide by that and are good tenants. I know we need protections for landlords, but right now I do believe that we are not treating our tenants as fairly as we should. I believe that our Residential Tenancies Board should provide better help, a little bit more handholding, a little more support.</p>
<p>I want to mention that if you, as an individual, take your complaint to the Residential Tenancies Board, you will find that when your landlord comes in, they're very friendly with the staff at the Residential Tenancies Board. They all know each other, they deal with each other all the time. As a tenant, you come in, and it's your first time ever at that board, and it's very intimidating to think that the people who are supposed to be the bureaucrats managing this process are so familiar with the lawyers and the owners and the representatives who come in from the owners' side. I think that's something government officials should be aware of as well. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <p>The honourable member for Hants West.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#310e08cc-3724-403f-821e-1a1076a68e6c"><from>MR. CHUCK PORTER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm just going to take a few minutes today and talk about some things going on and some things that are important to Nova Scotians as we move forward. What a way to start it off, after a weekend that we had with regard to the environment. I read a resolution earlier in the House today, with all of the great things that took place around the province and what people are doing. As tough as times have been, as hard as things have been on a lot of other fronts, it's interesting to see the people who came out on the weekend to take part in a number of events around the province.</p>
<p>At home where I come from in Hants West, specifically the Windsor area, was no exception. We had a group of close to 100 people that gathered to do a first-time event, which was planting trees. I think it was called the Tree Canopy Project. It was organized by a committee that's been working on this now for almost a year, and 227 trees were planted in and around town - if you can believe that - in Windsor and a little bit out Chester Road. It was quite an event, with three different groups going around and taking part. We were digging the holes, planting the trees, filling it back in, and driving in stakes to support it.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see the age groups who were involved in this project. When we think about all the debate we have in here at times and the bills that go through this House, and we talk about the environment, we talk about protected areas, we talk about sustainable environmental goals - we've been talking about that for quite a few years in this House now, Mr. Speaker. I found it quite interesting to see how many people, but the age group as I was saying - we had people there who were probably 3 or 4 years old, with their parents, and there were family groups who were part of this, which was nice to see as well, to be quite honest with you.</p>
<p>We don't see that in a lot of things when we're out doing things, but we're fortunate where I come from that there is a lot of that kind of thing that goes on where families are involved. It's probably that way around the province but from the very young to those who were maybe significantly older, I'll put it, but not too old to be there and doing everything from digging the holes and getting their hands dirty and sort of having an understanding.</p>
<p>You know it rained a bit, it was a little damp, but people were out there in good spirits, they were dressed appropriately, and they were having a good time. More importantly, what I found amazing was how interested they were and how much they understood the importance of the environment. I'm not sure that I ever took part in a program in the past years when we celebrated Earth Day and so on like that, where these kinds of events were put together and the people maybe quite clearly understood it.</p>
<p>Now I know that we do these projects whereby you'll turn your lights off or you'll walk, or walk to work or you'll do all these things in an effort to save the environmental footprint and all of those things. Like I said, we talk a lot about the environment in this place and what we can do better. We know there are a variety of issues in the province related to the environment - I believe the Department of Natural Resources went around the province and they were in my area. People were very concerned, property owners who have camp leases up in Panuke Lake comes to mind, back of Stillwater. It was about access points and how important it was for them to be able to continue to access their area, to go back and do their recreational things. A lot of them like to go four-wheeling or ski-dooing or even hiking back through these areas to get to their cottages and enjoy their summertime - and some of them go all year round.</p>
<p>People say, how does the environment affect what we do back there? Well it does. We know that it does; there's an impact on the environment in just every single thing we do. Although we talk a fair bit about it in here, sometimes I think the point is missed and I'm not sure how many people really pay attention to what it is we are trying to do here when it comes to sustainable, long-term goals that are good for the environment in this province.</p>
<p>We have to continue to do that - and I am by no means an environmentalist but I do believe in doing things that make a difference when it comes to protecting our environment. There's a whole wide variety of scenarios on the environment and global warming and we've heard all these stories.</p>
<p>When we think about the budget and I do know that the estimates are just starting over in the Red Chamber on the Department of Environment - and I'll take part in that in a little while, I hope to get a chance to take part in that as well - it will be interesting to see the real numbers. Are we truly investing the way that we should be, are we writing policy in the laws in this province, the legislation, the way that we should be to protect us for the long term?</p>
<p>Again what I found on the weekend that people were talking about, they weren't just talking oh, isn't this a great thing to come together and do it, they were talking about the long-term effects of these trees. When it was all over - and what was kind of interesting, in the afternoon we came together and along with this was part of the town cleanup and picking up garbage in the ditches along the way where we were planting and so on like that - when it was done there were two young students from Avon View High who were part of the, I guess you would call it the media club or something like that, they are studying to probably move on to journalism in trade school later on when they graduate, and they were filming this entire thing, all the different locations around the day and they were doing interviews afterward.</p>
<p>Remember, these are high school kids, a couple of young people who were really interested in what they were doing - I think partly because it involves technology and all the things the kinds like to be part of today. The questions they put to a couple of us whom they interviewed were quite amazing, about the long-term view on this and what we thought and how proud people were in the community to be taking part, and what they thought about it in general, what the family unit thought about it, but, more importantly, what did it mean to our community and to the people in it. You know those are pretty easy answers to that stuff, as you can well imagine the impact that would have.</p>
<p>These young people will stand up a few years down the road and say hey, I was part of planting that tree; I took part, I helped pick up garbage on that day; we celebrated on the waterfront and did a variety of good things.</p>
<p>We need to make sure if we're going to invest in programs and things in this province that we're investing the right way. I know that everybody has their hand out in every department in government looking for more money to invest in more things but when we are talking about budgets, we should be thinking about, down the road - what does that mean for the environment and what are the real goals that we are trying to meet? We know that there are targets that are put in the place in the federal government and sometimes those are difficult to meet. I'm not sure that the targets are realistic; we would probably like to think they were, depending on what they are.</p>
<p>We've heard a lot of talk on the energy side and how the greenhouse gas emissions are an ongoing issue in this province and that we're trying to reduce our coal footprint, maybe much to the chagrin of some who come from that part of the world where it's still a big piece. I know you come from there, Mr. Speaker, from Cape Breton where there is hope for coal mining into the future and we know it's going to be around for some time. But we have to take it all in stride. We know we're not going to get there overnight; we're not going to close that down overnight. So as we move forward with long-term goals, we should be thinking about what 20 to 25 years out means for that industry. Does it mean it will be no more? Does it mean technology will be better? Are we investing the right way? Can we meet the sustainable goals that are put in place? Can we meet the targets that the federal government forces on the rest of the country and provinces?</p>
<p>We don't know what 20 to 25 years will do, in all honesty, when it comes to an industry like the coal development in this province in mining, as an example, with the technology and changes and how we continue to take that stuff out of the ground. We may see that there is an opportunity that comes along that allows the coal to be cleaned, if you will, to create less gas emissions. It may become very reasonable, not only in price, but to think that we can continue to provide an energy source through that.</p>
<p>We have to remember it's all well and good to talk about all the energy goals, and all the environmental goals, we also have economic goals in this province where we want to have people working. I know where you come from, Mr. Speaker, that's important just like it is to everyone else around this province. A lot of people have worked in that industry over the years. We need to make sure that there is something there, that we can do that, and we can't stress enough the economic goals within the province and that's just one piece - the coal mining site.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what you do, most people will argue that there are greenhouse gas emissions created when you are creating energy sources. Well that's probably true, I guess, to some point. We do have to keep our goals reasonable, though - I guess you would call them goals - and targets that are in place, that they can be met, that they are sustainable, that they are good, that we should be doing everything we can to continue to protect our environment, Mr. Speaker, but we have to do it to a degree which is affordable to Nova Scotians and to Canadians all around, not just here in Nova Scotia but to Canadians all around. We still have a long way to go, I think, as we make our way forward with that policy. I think we've been leaders with that bill that went in in 2007. I think we've done a good job on that; I think we continue to build on that.</p>
<p>Last week in this House we talked about protected areas, I think there might have even been some questions back and forth in QP, and I know that the minister has spoken to it, he's probably speaking to it right now as he makes his way into estimates, about the protected areas of Nova Scotia. We had a number of protected areas, certain parks and other locations. There has been a lot of concern expressed from people throughout the province, not just from where I come from but in many counties and areas where protected areas are being thought about or in place - that they block you. People think that they will not be able to go in there anymore, and perhaps they won't in some areas, depending on the degree to which they're protected. They are huge concerns and I don't know that we're working close enough with those people out there who are users of the land. We have to remember one thing as we continue to want to make the percentage of protected areas higher in this province - is that reasonable?</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not reasonable but I think we need to work closely with the people who enjoy the land and those people are Nova Scotians. That's who really owns the land; that's who has the rights to - certainly the Crown land. It is theirs to enjoy as they should see fit, at the same time being well educated on what it means to keep it pristine and not out there doing things like dumping garbage, as we've seen in some areas. There is an article today that takes me there, and I'll get back to that, but I think it's important and I think that most people I have spoken to are really good stewards of the environment.</p>
<p>You know you talk about the ATVers out there, the clubs, the different organizations, the boy scouts who go out there, and the girl guides and all of these people. There are a number of people in Cottage Country who use these lands. They love to go fishing and these days, the further back they go, the more opportunity they have of catching something a little larger. Now everything is so accessible. Over the years it has become easily accessed so they like to get back there to hike, to bike, to do all of those things, so the last thing we should be thinking about is shutting that off.</p>
<p>We talk about recreational activities and ParticipACTION, people being healthy in this province. I don't think we look at the spinoff effects from what that really means when it goes toward the environment. It all fits together, and we have to keep that in mind when we're thinking about these goals, the long-term sustainable goals of the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that we're taking that into consideration. I guess I'd like to think we are. We talk about it sometimes. I don't know if policy will include it as we move forward, but I do know there are a lot of issues when it comes to the environment.</p>
<p>I wanted to touch briefly on the great weekend that we did have, and the cleanup. Then today what was rather discouraging was to open The ChronicleHerald, only to read an on-line article about an area of Falmouth, which is in my constituency - the Bog Road area, where garbage has been dumped for some time, and to see the enforcement officer out there from the Municipality of West Hants, Gary Lunn, talking about the story and how this has gone on for years.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe in this day and age, in all honesty, with the leadership that the province has shown over the years with regard to recycling. We do it in schools, as you know, Mr. Speaker, and we've been doing it for years. Our children taught us how, is how I often put it, and we thank them for that.</p>
<p>We've been leaders in this province. We've been leaders when it comes to landfill sites and the development and how that all breaks down. We've been very good at it, and then to see an article like that immediately following Earth Day and after a weekend like we've had is a bit discouraging. I hope it's an eye-opener for people to say, do you know what? This isn't the right thing - we've got a dump, we can put our garbage out to the corner, we can take it.</p>
<p>Some people might get a little discouraged about taking garbage down to the dump itself, or to the landfill - I should call it what it is - and having to pay $5 to dump it. Well, do you know what? If that's a problem, then we should talk about that. Maybe there are people who just cannot afford to do that. Maybe we should take that into consideration. There should be another option. We have to try to discourage this stuff.</p>
<p>Like I said, it's very disheartening from an area - and when I think about where that area is, on the Little Bog Road in Falmouth, and reading that article this morning - it's just right next door, if you will, to a beautiful subdivision where a community has been built, and ball fields and soccer fields and good community energy and money have been invested to make our area better, greener, cleaner, more friendly, and a nice place to go - and then we find this mess.</p>
<p>It's not the only one. We've experienced some other areas - and probably around the province, if we talk to other members or talk to other folks from around the province, this probably has happened in numerous places. We know from years past that this was a common occurrence, where people would take their old garbage and throw it into an old pit that might have existed at one time, and just left it there to rot and do whatever it is it does. It was very common in those days to do that.</p>
<p>I know, as I wrap up - it's hard to believe 15 minutes go by so quickly, Mr. Speaker - but again, I just want to take another second here and say kudos to all the people who took part in activities around the province this weekend. To those from Hants West, it was a great time out there, and I really enjoyed seeing everybody. I look forward to future years and having folks of all ages, the young and the older, take part and work together to make our environment what it should be: cleaner and greener.</p>
<p>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I'll take my seat.</p></speech>
