          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>The honourable Minister of Energy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about an important agreement that impacts all Nova Scotians. My colleagues in the Legislature, the public, and the partners in the energy industry are all very interested in the government's position on the Maritime Link project. Last Friday the Utility and Review Board ruled that the project agreement will proceed and made it clear that Emera and Nalcor shareholders take on project risks, not ratepayers. This is a significant milestone and one our government helped shape by intervening at the recent hearings to ensure Nova Scotia ratepayers' interests are protected.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to remind Nova Scotians that our Party is on record as stating the Maritime Link was a project with potential, but our issue is with the structure of the deal and risk for ratepayers; in fact, while appearing at the Resources Committee meeting of October 2011, I said that the thing that frustrates me sometimes is every time you ask a question about Churchill Falls, there are a lot of people who say you're against the project.</p>
<p>I just want to be clear that I'm not against the project, although I have questions about some information that has been put out about it and also in terms of where this fits in the overall scheme. I think there are important questions that we need answers to. I do think the Muskrat Falls project is an important component of our entire energy mix. And that is on the record in Hansard from October 2011.</p>
<p>In Opposition I raised risks to the project like water management, non-delivery, and availability of surplus energy. The previous government said don't worry, despite it not being enshrined in the agreement. Through the actions of the Utility and Review Board and our government, these issues are now addressed so the risks of these issues are no longer on ratepayers. Even in its first ruling on the project, the Utility and Review Board clearly agreed with our position at the board and that of other interveners. On July 22<sup>nd</sup> the Utility and Review Board approved the project with conditions that Emera must obtain a guarantee of access to market price electricity from Nalcor or an alternative source. These are issues I had raised in my arguments before the board and ones they largely agreed with. My position in support of the board's decision, as well as the Premier's in support of the board's decision in July was widely reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the recent compliance hearing was about whether or not the Energy Access Agreement met the condition for access to market energy, as required as part of the board's conditional approval in July. The board clearly stated they were not revisiting the link as a project during the recent hearing and it wasn't about whether the board was approving the Maritime Link deal and charging it back to customers - this approval had already been granted conditional on the compliance filing. This was about the structure of the agreement, and this government was not satisfied with the agreement as presented.</p>
<p>We reviewed the evidence from all sides; we had the government lawyer ask tough questions in the hearing - something which was noted as rarely, if ever, having been seen before. We spent a considerable amount of time before closing arguments reviewing whether or not we were satisfied. We determined that the details of the agreement could address our concerns, but we were troubled because we didn't think the agreement itself was clear enough as presented.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Nova Scotia ratepayers we proposed eight conditions to improve the agreement and ensure ratepayers were protected. That's why we pushed to make sure that the project risks were with Emera and Nalcor, not ratepayers.</p>
<p>On November 29<sup>th</sup> the Utility and Review Board ruled that the revised agreement - combined with the explanations and commitments made by Emera during the hearing - finally met its condition on access to market energy. The board's decision also fully met, and in some cases exceeded, the conditions put forward by the province. I quote from the board's decision:</p>
<blockquote>"The Province, and other Intervenors, had recommended that the Board impose a number of conditions. The Board considers that interpreting the [Energy Access Agreement] in accordance with the above representations and clarifications is a more appropriate manner of dealing with the concerns raised by the Province and other Intervenors. However, the Board observes that, as a practical matter, the end result, on a number of issues, is very similar to the conditions proposed by the Province."</blockquote>
<p>On the day the conditions were announced, I said that we would accept the exact wording or a ruling that achieves the same effect as our conditions. From the second we received the document, I, along with our legal advisors and staff, reviewed the decision. Everyone came to the same conclusion. Our lawyers reviewed the decision, and while lawyers rarely agree, they did in this case. The conditions were met in full.</p>
<p>The concerns behind all of our conditions are now part of the decision. This revised Energy Access Agreement we have today is significantly better for Nova Scotian ratepayers than the previous agreement from six months ago, the one the former government recommended the board approve without condition. Why?</p>
<p>I want to clearly point out the benefits to Nova Scotians. We now have a guarantee of access to market energy, and the result will be a competitive market. In addition to Nalcor energy, we will be able to access competitive power from other sources. We now have guarantees of access to surplus energy. We did not have this before. We now have a guarantee that risk is shifted away from ratepayers to Emera and Nalcor. We did not have this before.</p>
<p>The revised agreement goes even further to outline exactly what the mechanics of sales and benefits to ratepayers will be. So overall, this is a different and much-improved deal for the Link project. Every single issue we expressed concern about with the Link deal is now fully addressed in the new arrangement.</p>
<p>We also need to consider the decisions of the previous government, and what will be new to Nova Scotians is a better understanding of where the previous administration made commitments which must now be weighed by this government, identifying legal and binding arrangements the previous administration made - commitments that we will and must uphold in good faith. For example, on November 30, 2012, there was a commitment made by Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Emera, and Nalcor to meet terms and conditions required to satisfy the federal loan guarantee. URB approval was a key condition that had to be met for other terms to be dealt with. Now, if we were not satisfied that our concerns were met, we would have walked away, but given that our conditions have been met, when you consider the potential risks that the previous government placed on us and taxpayers as a result of their legal agreements, it would not make sense to put taxpayers at risk at this point.</p>
<p>With the changes we have managed to achieve we have shifted the risk away from ratepayers and from taxpayers, so it makes sense to continue with arrangements that were signed in good faith. Now that the Utility and Review Board has given the Maritime Link Project a green light, and with the final actions by our government, the remaining conditions required by the Province of Nova Scotia for the federal loan guarantee will be met through legislation which this House will debate in the coming days.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to say that we appreciate the efforts of our federal colleagues who worked diligently with us and the project proponents to finalize the necessary agreements, and in particular, responded to our concerns in the past few weeks. With the federal loan guarantee, Nova Scotians will benefit from significant cost savings. As we said last year, if the project were to proceed, it must have the loan guarantee.</p>
<p>Today I also launched a micro Web site on the Department of Energy portal to answer questions of the public on what is different about this deal and to provide them information about the board's decision and how the conditions were met. I know the public has questions about cost, risk, mechanics, and opportunities, and many of these questions will be answered on this Web site.</p>
<p>It is important to me that Nova Scotians are given answers to their questions. Nova Scotians deserve answers, the most complete answers we can give. As questions come in we will answer them in as timely a fashion as we can and I want to say we've already received some today and we hope to get answers up very quickly.</p>
<p>This project is just about one aspect of our energy future, and the work does not stop here. I will be discussing the possible advantages of regional co-operation on grid and other energy issues at the upcoming meeting of the Atlantic Energy Ministers. It is important to note that the benefits of this to ratepayers, the regional co-operation, are actually predicated on the link and the competitive environment being in existence.</p>
<p>We will also soon begin a very significant consultation and review process - the first in 13 years - on what Nova Scotians expect and need from their electricity system. The bill I introduced last week is only an early part of that electricity future. My vision, our vision as government, is an energy future where Nova Scotians have greater choice, where ratepayers come first and have a direct role in determining our energy future. Thank you.</p></speech>

CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the minister for giving us a copy of his statement today. The Maritime Link is one in which the whole deal has been shrouded in secrecy with so many unanswered questions for so long that it is interesting to hear someone actually stand up and explain some of it. I commend the minister for that because we didn't necessarily get it from our friends who are sitting way off to our left here now.</p>
<p>This caucus has never doubted the value of the Muskrat Falls project itself; we simply stand up for ratepayers to make sure they are getting the best deal possible. This multi-billion dollar project will lock people of Nova Scotia in for decades to come. That's a commitment that we are not prepared to make without very careful consideration. The minister did not provide the answer to the question he most frequently asked the former government, and I hope it might end up in his micro-site when that time comes: What can Nova Scotians expect to pay for the power we are going to get from Muskrat Falls?</p>
<p>These questions are too important not to have answers to. How can Nova Scotians celebrate the deal without knowing what they'll see when they open their power bills? Skyrocketing power rates have plagued family budgets for far too long and Nova Scotians need a break. The Utility and Review Board hearing on the compliance filing was very telling. There were a number of interveners, including the PC Caucus, who were there to represent the interests of ratepayers.</p>
<p>In Opposition, now the Minister of Energy, criticized the former government for sending department staff to the URB hearings; he said: The fact is there is a difference between being represented and actually participating to defend Nova Scotians. The minister himself was not an intervener, which I found interesting. I thought he would be there on those days that we were there, especially on the last go round for the changes. I guess he decided he had better things to do at the time; maybe he was reading the portfolio and getting ready for the House sitting.</p>
<p>The government needs to prove to Nova Scotians that their power bills will not continue to climb. The Liberals made a number of contradictory statements about what the Maritime Link will do to power bills. It's time they answered what should have been their first answer all along - what will power rates be? Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#803ea908-016e-4462-b4b5-e2a418f97f23"><from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for giving us this statement in advance. The minister likes to heap much praise about the deal, particularly on himself. He likes to go on and talk about the eight positions they put forward and they were all accepted. But they were soundly rejected and even in a ChronicleHerald column on Emera by Ms. Stephenson, <i>Emera gets early Christmas gift on Maritime Link approval</i>, the provincial regulator rejected eight conditions requested by the Nova Scotia Liberal Government. I'll table that. (Intteruption)</p>
<p>Okay, I'm getting encouragement from the minister, but he likes to say, well, I've always been a proponent of the Maritime Link, but in Opposition he and the now-Premier were saying, let's look at Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, this is who we want. They were picking then, Mr. Speaker. They wanted Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec - that was their friend, Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec. These are issues that, for clarity's sake, have to be put out there. Ministerial statements should be about the position of the ministry, not about the minister trumpeting or trying to rewrite history.</p>
<p>In May 2012, the former Energy Minister introduced legislation entitled an Act to Ensure Regulatory Review of the Maritime Link. That legislation subjected an open and transparent review at the URB. That was done. The regulator was tasked with determining whether or not the Maritime Link would be the lowest-cost option for Nova Scotians. The current Premier and the now-Minister of Energy continued to flip-flop on this issue, expressing their doubts in the project in one breath, while supporting it - as he just did - in the next. If Nova Scotians are confused, I would certainly understand that.</p>
<p>But it was really their support of Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec that makes their whole stance today so amazing when it comes to this government and their many flip-flops. Whether it's around Efficiency Nova Scotia or whatever, it's like it's one thing in Opposition, another thing in government.</p>
<p>I think in this whole process what we have to realize is that the independence of the URB has worked. We put it there, we said it would be up to them to do this. It's an independent body. Things like this should not be decided solely by politicians, so we were more than happy to put it there, although my friend in the Progressive Conservative Party said it wasn't transparent. I suppose he looked at it with a more myopic view than he should have, but I forgive him for that, Mr. Speaker. Well, it is getting close to that season, and I often tell people I come from a religion of atonement.</p>
<p>This is going to make up about 30 per cent of our energy needs, and this is an historic perspective in this province when it comes here. Last night in debate on another energy bill - we've had many issues about securing access to energy for this province and what it means to Nova Scotians. We relied for a long time on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels really aren't a proper mix for today's environment, so we have to look at that and be forward thinkers when it comes to our energy needs. Part of that energy mix will be in Lower Churchill, and it will provide stable costs for all ratepayers for many years to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I wanted to do today is thank the people at the URB for their hard work on this file. It has not been easy for them to take all the information that has been given to them, to synthesize it, and make sure that Nova Scotians were looked after. I think the URB has made the right decision. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier announced he will be making changes to taxes seniors pay in this province, yet days before the same Premier hiked 1,400 user fees by 6 per cent on top of the 2 per cent hike the Premier did only two years ago - among other things home care fees have been increased by 5.8 per cent.</p>
<p>These fee increases take effect this week, while the Premier's tax changes are supposed to take effect after the next election. So my question to the Premier is, will the Premier tell seniors why he has hiked user fees effective immediately but is waiting until after the election to fulfill his proposed tax changes?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined">
            <from>THE PREMIER</from>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, seniors this year, just as they have for a number of years now, who are on the GIS, come September will receive a full rebate of every cent that they have paid in GIS as a result of the initiative taken by this government. In addition, because of the work of the Minister of Finance and of our colleagues in the Cabinet, an additional $22 million has been invested in providing home care services directly to those people who need it. This is an improvement in the lives of seniors, one that we're very proud of and one that I would hope that the Leader of the Opposition would agree with.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>The Premier forgot to mention that he increased power rates in the Province of Nova Scotia by 30 per cent; the Premier forgot to mention that he increased 1,400 user fees in the province; he forgot to mention that he increased HST by 2 per cent - and, by the way, I just want to tell the Premier seniors also pay those fees and taxes.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, most savings that seniors will eventually see from the proposed tax changes will be swallowed up by other costs that the NDP have imposed on Nova Scotians. The Premier hiked user fees this week and he stood by and watched power rates increase by over 30 per cent. Seniors are struggling with the same cost prices other Nova Scotians are, often on fixed incomes. This means they are more sensitive to user fee hikes, to tax hikes of any kind, and they are more sensitive to the increase in power bills - and I might add 30 per cent under this Premier's watch. So my question to the Premier is, why is the Premier only interested in more election promises rather than tackling the real cost pressures seniors face today?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, in fact, the increases in power rates are the result of decisions that were made by Liberal Governments, who shackled us to the international fossil fuel markets, and that it was the increase in the international price of coal that drove the fee increases; in fact, something that we on this side are actually trying to ensure doesn't happen in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Speaker, when the HST increase came in, we actually took that money from that increase and gave it to seniors, gave it to people on low incomes, not only to offset, but to more than offset the amount of money that would be paid by a 2 per cent increase in the HST. Seniors, as a result of that measure, are better off and, most assuredly, they are better off because now, contrary to the wishes of the Leader of the Opposition, they no longer have to pay 10 per cent on the electrical and energy costs in this province.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what they pay is the NDP electricity tax - the very tax that they opposed when in Opposition. You know, saying one thing prior to an election, and then doing something else. This is yet another election promise. And every Nova Scotian in this province knows what an election promise from this Premier is worth. With no tax increases, and no promised program cuts, Nova Scotians watched as this Premier hiked taxes, he has cut $65 million from education, and put social programs in jeopardy. And Nova Scotians are bracing for more of this tomorrow. The Premier doesn't have a revenue problem; he has a priority problem.</p>
<p>After breaking the election promises of 2009, how can seniors trust him to deliver on yet another election promise, Mr. Speaker?</p></speech>

<p>Many Nova Scotians are skeptical that the NDP will present a truly balanced budget tomorrow. And they have good reason to be, since it's the Treasury Board that approved the $27 million hole in last year's budget. Prepayments to universities have also been used in the past to create the fiction of a balanced budget, but that practice belongs in the past and has no business in today's budgets.</p>
<p>So my question to the Chair of the Treasury Board is, has he provided our universities with their 2013-14 budget allocations?</p></speech>

BAILLIE</from><p>Well, Mr. Speaker, in fact, the Treasury Board Chair has provided our universities with their 2013-14 budget allocations, and I have the letter that he sent to them right here, which I'll table in just a moment if he wants to refresh his memory. But there's something very interesting about this letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it does point out how much they are going to receive for 2014, all of the universities, and it points out how much they received two years ago, in 2011-12. But what the letter is silent on is how much they're going to be accounted for in the year that we're just ending, 2012-13. Very convenient if the Chair of the Treasury Board plans to stuff two years of funding into the year that just ended.</p>
<p>I will table this letter from the Chair of the Treasury Board and I will ask him, why did he omit the current year information? Is it because he plans to prepay the universities and present a falsely-balanced budget tomorrow?</p></speech>

          <heading>PREM.: JOB LOSSES - IMPORTANCE</heading>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, since the Premier has taken power, the economy has stalled and communities across this province are dealing with high unemployment rates. While it may create a newspaper headline or a good photo op, handing over hundreds of millions of free money to large corporations is poor public policy. Nova Scotians know this, and the proof is in the numbers: 6,400 jobs were lost last year alone, the same year the Premier handed over hundreds of millions of dollars to large corporations.</p>
<p>My question to the Premier is, will the Premier explain to Nova Scotians why newspaper headlines and photo ops are more important to him than getting Nova Scotians back to work?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to correct what the Leader of the Opposition said. Of course, we don't hand over any money to anyone. What we do is make investments where we will see a return for the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In every instance where any money is invested by the province, it is done on the basis of a commercial loan. It is only forgiven, if it is forgiven, once money comes in, so that the people of Nova Scotia - for example, in the case of the largest industrial contract in our history, the shipbuilding contract - the people of Nova Scotia will realize more than a $2 billion profit on that investment. That money will be used to support health, education, and the other services that are important for the people of Nova Scotia. That, I believe, is not just an explanation. It begs the question, what in the world would they do if they were in government? What in the world would they do?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the closer we get to an election, the larger the Premier's numbers become on the return to the people of Nova Scotia. The fact of the matter is, he has handed over $300 million of free money. Anyone with common sense will tell you that in order to grow our economy we need to diversify and grow it one job at a time. However, that doesn't fit with the Premier's photo op schedule. He just wants the splashy headline. That's all he's looking for. The corporations see the Premier coming.</p>
<p>While the Premier is handing over hundreds of millions of dollars to corporations, Cape Breton is struggling with a 17 per cent unemployment rate; the North Shore, 12.5 per cent; the Annapolis Valley, 10.4 per cent; and in southern Nova Scotia, it's a 12.2 per cent unemployment rate under this Premier's watch. What will it take for the Premier to learn that his corporate welfare agenda is not working for Nova Scotians?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, over the last seven years the Province of Nova Scotia has made more than $80 million on commercial loans that it has given to companies in this province. That return is used for either further investment by bringing companies here or in the services that the people of this province need - not a single cent was given to Irving or to anyone else, a commercial loan.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition can say otherwise if he wants, but he knows that it's untrue, and at some point in time he is actually going to have to account for that to the people. They know that what he says is untrue. The people who work in the yard, Mr. Speaker, the hard-working marine workers, the architects, the engineers who are there, the people who are reliant on that contract for the work that they do and for the paycheques that they take home to support their families, we on this side of the aisle support the working people of Nova Scotia. I'm not sure who they're speaking for.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#fe20fa65-2371-4fef-a6ec-d2a63b72dfa5"><from>MR. MCNEIL</from><p>Someone ought to tell him that he is the Premier of Nova Scotia, not the Governor of the Bank of Nova Scotia, Mr. Speaker, the way he is handing out money.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Premier likes to brag about lowering the small business tax rate, but what he forgets to tell Nova Scotians is that he also lowered the threshold amount. So the Premier is essentially penalizing success, so let's get it straight, right? If you are a small business in the Province of Nova Scotia and you've been successful, this Premier wants you to pay more tax, at the same time that he is handing out free money to large corporations.</p>
<p>With over 6,400 fewer Nova Scotians employed than last year, will the Premier finally admit he can't grow the economy by writing blank cheques to large corporations and abandoning hard working Nova Scotians?</p></speech>

          <heading>ENERGY - MAR. LINK: REVIEW - URB TIMELINE</heading>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy. You can almost - well you never get a straight answer on the Maritime Link out of the Minister of Energy, the Premier or, frankly, anyone in the NDP because they either don't have the answers or they don't want people to know them.</p>
<p>Yesterday the minister and his caucus colleagues carefully avoided giving any reason why they won't extend the timeline for the Utility and Review Board to make a decision in the best interests of Nova Scotians. To quote the Consumer Advocate, "All Nova Scotians are entitled to be assured the Board has adequate time to access and consider all relevant evidence and to determine what is the lowest long-term alternative." And I'll table that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, will the minister change the regulations and allow the board whatever time it deems appropriate and necessary to properly review the Maritime Link, or will his promise of last year of a complete, fair and transparent review by the board just go down as one more broken NDP promise?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable Minister of Environment (Interruption) Energy, sorry.</p>

          <speech by="#4fbcc786-c835-4a0e-bd05-40afb30e0683"><from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from><p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm sure the Minister of Environment could answer the question adequately as well, but we all know that the Maritime Link is an important project here in Nova Scotia and in the Maritime region and it is going to provide us an opportunity to get the lowest, fairest rates for electricity for Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>The Maritime Link Act that set up the review with the URB was passed in this House unanimously. It was supported by the Liberal Party; it was supported by the Progressive Conservative Party; and supported here by government. When the opportunity came to have the regulations out for discussion last summer, did we hear from the Liberal Party? Not at all. Did we hear from the other Opposition Party? Not at all. There has been lots of opportunity there - plus we consulted with the URB and they indicated that the half-year timeline was adequate to fully address and review the situation, so it will continue in the six month time frame and we're looking forward to the decision by the end of July.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>MR. YOUNGER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, maybe he should have given it to the Minister of Environment, maybe we would have gotten an answer for once. The Minister of Energy - it's entertaining to listen to him because, of course, the fact is that he talks about supporting the Act, the Act which he insisted for weeks wasn't even necessary, and I will table the Hansard from that where I specifically said we'll support the Act but they put it all in regulations and we'll just have to hope they get them right.</p>
<p>Then he says, well nobody said anything last summer. Well, you know what, Mr. Speaker, last summer he promised us that the Consumer Advocate and everybody else said six months would be enough, well in March and in February when the documents were filed, the Consumer Advocate, the Small Business Advocate, the Wind Energy Association, almost all the other interveners have said you know what, it turns out that isn't going to be enough time. There was no way for them or anybody else to know last summer.</p>
<p>So Mr. Speaker, the minister previously promised a full and complete review by the Utility and Review Board. The Consumer Advocate, the Small Business Advocate, they all say that's not possible now, not possible. So will he keep his commitment from last year and allow the time needed to review the project fully or again is he simply going to break another NDP promise?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Education, parents, students, school boards, and communities across the province have been put through heartache and turmoil over the potential closures of rural schools for months and months. Some communities and towns have actually been pitted one against the other as they go through a flawed school review process. Now, on the eve of an election, the minister flip-flops on school closures and I'll ask her, why did the minster put so many families, students, and school boards through the wringer if she was truly going to suspend the process all along?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to clarify that I'm not able to put a halt to anything. What I've done today is, I have asked the school boards to suspend the review process for the year 2013-14 and to delay any of the decisions that were made in the year 2012-13. I've asked the school boards that, and I will hear back if they're going to honour that request by April 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>

BAILLIE</from><p>Actually, Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Education is in a position to halt these things and chose not to for the last two years. In fact, I have here with me a quote from the Minister of Education just last year, which I will table, where she says, "Parents are going to have to recognize that not all schools will stay open." Those are the words of the Minister of Education, who then went on to say, "I know we'd like to each have our own little school, but we do have to sometimes take a deep breath and move our children off to another school." Those are the words of the Minister of Education last year. I'll table that for her.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, everyone who read that - parents, school boards, students - took the minister at her word, that she was going to force them down this awful road. So now that she has flip-flopped, will she apologize to the school boards, to the students, and to the parents who took her at her word when she said they were just going to have to realize that schools are going to close?</p></speech>

The request that I made today is not going to save all of our schools in the province. We have an issue with declining enrolment and we have excess capacity, but we have a process that we inherited, that we did try to improve, and it didn't work.</p>
<p>I am hearing back from parents and community members that this process has been adversarial and heartbreaking, so the process finished on March 31<sup>st</sup>. I've asked the school boards if they would suspend the process.</p>
<p>If the honourable member will look at legislation, I am not able to interfere. All I can do is ask the school board if they'll honour the requests that I've made today, and we'll hear back by April 30<sup>th</sup>.</p></speech>

This announcement today has nothing to do with enrolments or a process. It's all about election year politics. That's what is going on today.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Speaker, just last May the minister was asked about stopping this school review process, and she said - and I'll table her own words - just last May, she said, "Definitely there will be no moratorium on the school review processes." Those were the words of the minister last year. Now that we're in an election year, she has flip-flopped.</p>

I cannot call a moratorium. There is no legislative capacity for the Minister of Education to do that.</p>
<p>I can ask the school boards.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Maritime Link deal that the NDP is rushing through the URB process contains too many unknowns. As we are discovering, the NDP either don't know or won't tell Nova Scotians what this deal means for our future power rates. Small and medium-sized businesses have consistently ranked energy costs as their main concern for the last number of years and the NDP's silence on the impact of power rates is distressing. My question is, can the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism tell Nova Scotian businesses what this multi-billion dollar project will mean for their power rates, their competitiveness and their ability to remain a vital part of their communities past 2017?</p>

This minister should know how this multi-billion dollar deal is going to affect small businesses in Nova Scotia. He certainly doesn't seem to know what the deal means for small businesses, the same businesses that have cited soaring energy as their top concern for as long as this government has been in power.

I will table that quote for the benefit of the Premier. Those were the words of the candidate for Premier while campaigning in 2009.</p>
<p>Since that time, the NDP has added over $1 billion to our provincial debt and tabled four consecutive deficit budgets and I will table the projected net debt of the province in the budget which shows that it has grown by $1 billion under his term in office. Now, Mr. Speaker, the Premier is promising to balance the budget yet again.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. The reality is that during that election campaign one of the key platform planks of the day happened to revolve around the question of stimulus spending that was coming from the federal government, from Mr. Harper. And in fact, the Progressive Conservatives of the day, you may remember had laid out a plan for about a billion and a half dollars' worth of spending, and the question that was routinely put to all of the Leaders at that time was whether or not we would maximize the investment that was put in place by the stimulus spending of the federal government. We said that we would, and we did.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>That's what the Premier says now, but it's not what he said when he was the candidate for Premier in 2009, as that CBC article shows. In fact, Mr. Speaker, when the Premier came into office Nova Scotia had a $19.7 million surplus. I have with me the message from the minister that accompanied the financial statements of the province that year, which clearly shows that - and I'll table that for the benefit of the House. It is kind of ironic that the government changed between the end of the year and when the message from the minister was signed, and of course is was signed by the new NDP Minister of Finance of the day, the member for Halifax Fairview.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Speaker, just like that famous Lucy and Charlie Brown cartoon, the Premier is, once again, holding the balanced budget football for Nova Scotians to take another kick at. We all know how that ended for poor old Charlie Brown - now we are paying the highest taxes in all of Canada, skyrocketing power rates, expensive user fees, and on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>Will the Premier admit that, just like Charlie Brown, Nova Scotians are flat on their backs because of his failed attempts to balance the budget?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, in the very last year of the Progressive Conservative decade, they overspent their budget by $408 million - $408 million more than they budgeted and they claim that that was a balance. Now, it happened that there were revenues that came in that same year, but nobody would call that a balance, that you set a budget figure, and then miss it by almost a half a billion dollars and go around and tell people somehow your budget is balanced. You want to talk about a kind of hocus-pocus, that is Progressive Conservative hocus-pocus.</p>

And, in fact, I was so pleased to see the Premier's second and current Minister of Finance write a letter to the editor of The Globe and Mail, which I will table, saying that Nova Scotia has had three deficit budgets in the last 10 years, and all three, of course, are the most recent three.</p>
<p>So, unlike the Premier, the previous Minister of Finance for the NDP, the current Minister of Finance for the NDP, and the Auditor General all say that they inherited a $19.7 million surplus. Here we are, four years later, not the candidate for Premier, the actual Premier, raised the HST to collect an extra billion dollars, added another billion dollars on top of that to our provincial debt, hikes up user fees, and makes it very expensive to live here.</p>
<p>Will the Premier finally admit the truth of what his current minister, his past minister, and the Auditor General says - that his failed attempt to manage the province's finances have made Nova Scotians pay the price over, and over, and over again?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. While in Opposition, the Liberals said they were vehemently opposed to power rate increases. In fact, last May the Liberal member for Richmond, now the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, criticized the NDP Government and said that this government is the only entity that has the power to take action and stand up to Nova Scotia Power. My question to the Premier is, does he still agree that the government has the ultimate power to take action and stand up to Nova Scotia Power when it comes to rate increases?</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, that's why the Minister of Energy was at the rate hearing, to stand up for Nova Scotia ratepayers to ensure there would not be further rate increases. Part of the question was asked today how much the energy would be. Yesterday imported energy was $53 a megawatt; energy that was produced in this province was $49 a megawatt. If the Maritime Link had been in production yesterday, under the new deal negotiated by the Minister of Energy, we would have had energy costs at $42 - that's $7 cheaper than energy produced in this province and $11 cheaper than those being imported. That's a good deal for Nova Scotia ratepayers.</p>

That will reduce power rates in Nova Scotia by taking a tax that these two Parties believe should still be on there, off the bills. That tax will come off and it will come off permanently.</p>

In light of the proposed hike in the Efficiency Nova Scotia charge, one would expect the new government to honour the Premier's words, so my question is, will the minister freeze the Efficiency Nova Scotia charge or will he eliminate it?</p>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, we are at the board at the moment, we are interveners in that hearing to ensure that that charge is not passed on. The member is well aware that I oppose any increase in the efficiency charge being passed on to ratepayers, just as I oppose to it being on the bills. I'm sorry that the Tories and the NDP still feel that Nova Scotians should have a tax on their electricity bills.</p></speech>

<p>In 2011-12 there were 11,300 income assistance clients who reported electricity in their monthly budgets, and that came to an annual cost of $12.9 million, about $1,141 per case. As well, there were 1,391 cases reporting utility arrears that totalled almost $1 million - $920,000. This minister should have a vested interest in ensuring that we have a full understanding of power rates before the government blindly signs on to this multi-billion dollar project - this has a direct impact on nearly 30,000 clients and her department's ability to deliver services.</p>

We're giving back, the HST is not being charged on home heating for those individuals and all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>We're also helping seniors with respect to the GIS - they no longer have to pay income tax; we also have, over the years, increased the Property Tax Rebate for Seniors by $200 in the first year; we've helped foster families by increasing their per diem; we have helped people who are on disabilities by increasing their enhanced family numbers amount per diem.

<p>Yesterday the average cost of production in Nova Scotia was $49 per megawatt hour. Imports were $53 a megawatt hour. If this link had been - and we can only bring in 5 per cent of our energy - if this had been in place yesterday, we would have been able to import the energy at $42 a megawatt hour.

            <p>Well, firstly, Mr. Speaker, it is not correct to say that we have frozen any of the grants. We have not done that at all. And once again, what any organization needs when they're planning for the future is to know about stability. The problem that they face today is because of the fact that the past decisions of relying on fossil fuel have created a situation in today's society where the energy rates are going up because we're relying on coal, which has gone up 70 percent. So I believe that those non-profit organizations are going to be very pleased with a government that has a plan for stability in their energy rates for years to come.</p>

So if the member has a crystal ball and can tell me what coal prices and natural gas prices will be in 20 years, that's great and we'll get him the comparison.</p>
<p>What we can say with absolute certainty now is it is cheaper than the alternate options.

I'm a little more encouraged but still leery, because I'm aware of the review that the department did. There is a current list of facilities across the province that are aged, that need replacement, and new demands in communities that have a void of new long-term care facilities. So finally, 61 beds were promised to the Mahone Nursing Home in Mahone Bay and scheduled also to begin in 2014.</p>
<p>I would ask the minister if he could provide an update to the people of Lunenburg County on when can they expect their long-term care beds to be prepared and start to see the construction of those facilities.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, the Cape Breton Regional Municipality has taken an incredible initiative in preparing a capital plan to partner with provincial and federal governments. The goal of this plan is to ensure a prosperous future for the municipality; it focuses on infrastructure improvements and building a progressive dynamic port city. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier support the CBRM proposal.</p>

As a result of the five-part series that The ChronicleHerald did on long-term care, this has become a topic that's on the minds of many Nova Scotians, and one that will be a pressure on our government. We are taking the top 10 or 11 most-needed facilities in the province and moving as quickly as possible to have them move through land procurement, through planning, and into the first phase of construction as quickly as possible. We're going to move those en bloc.</p>
<p>I also would like to convey to the member opposite that our plan will emphasize an enhanced home care program. We want to be able to support and help as many Nova Scotians stay in their home as long as possible, and to do it safely at a high quality of care.</p></speech>

We had a great chat about the budget, he presented me with a portfolio. I indicated to him at the time that we were waiting to see, among other things, what the new Building Canada Fund was going to look like, but I told him that I was supportive of multi-year budgeting on capital projects, that we were willing to work with CBRM.</p>
<p>Now that they had outlined the, kind of, broad-brush projects, that we were willing work with them in order to dig down into those projects and to determine what they would cost, and to work with him in putting forward those projects to the Building Canada Fund over a multi-year period and to try to achieve what we both want, which is strength in infrastructure in the province.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, it's important to develop capital plans for municipalities and more so to continue the communications between municipalities and the province. Open and honest negations are the key components of successful capital planning. If the mayor is not being given a clear commitment financially, what direction or criteria has your government given to the mayor to assist with evolution of his plan?</p>

          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, what I told the Mayor of Cape Breton Regional Municipality was simply this: we had introduced a capital planning process that was different than that in the past. In fact, we looked very much through the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal at multi-year budgeting, as we did with a five-year road construction plan, that we felt this was a good model. I congratulated him and his council for having the foresight to bring forward a multi-year plan and we agreed to work with him.</p>
<p>As the member opposite would know, we actually bring out capital budgets in the Fall, so that contractors who are looking to participate in bids on projects will know in advance of the Spring budget that those projects are coming forward and therefore, will be better able to prepare for those bids.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with the Mayor of CRBM on this, to the benefit of the people of industrial Cape Breton and, of course, of all those communities within the regional municipality but also because we think this is a good model for the rest of the province. We believe that others, through the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities may want to also participate in.</p></speech>

Cape Breton has suffered under the economic hardships imposed by the NDP. Power rates have increased by over 28 per cent since October 2009, and I'll table a document from Statistics Canada. Another 3 per cent increase is to go forward again this January, pushing more and more people out of our communities and our local companies out of business.</p>
<p>My question to the minister is, will the minister give the people of Cape Breton some comfort and commitment to standing up for them against Nova Scotia Power and stop this rate increase?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#e14ef5f0-e76a-4413-842d-24e0bfcba8d2"><from>MR. ORRELL</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I believe there was a specific ask in negotiations with the Premier at that time. Now if the CBRM was a big company, I'm sure the cheque would already be in the mail. We believe it would be better to be a productive partner with municipalities rather than work against them.</p>
<p>Will the Premier commit to open and honest negotiations, while ensuring the outlined projects that are desperately needed are followed through completion? What I'm hearing is, it sounds like will he commit to that, especially in the Fall?</p></speech>
          <speech by="#e23caf06-dcf3-42a5-8a00-f4435df40350"><from>MR. MACLEOD</from><p>Mr. Speaker, the minister has already identified one issue, and that is the rising cost of power for businesses in our communities. Since October 2009, the population in Cape Breton has decreased by 4,700 people, and I will table that document as well. Full-time employment is stagnant. Nearly 5,000 people are leaving our island for better earning capacity, lower taxes, lower power rates, and I know we are all worried that this cycle may continue.</p>
<p>My question for the minister is what steps has the minister's government taken to ensure that power rates for people and businesses are brought back to affordable rates?</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#premier" status="undefined"><from>THE PREMIER</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it's one of those days where a question is getting asked and an answer is being given. Quite frankly, I think we're on the same page, even though the answer and questions seem to be missing each other.</p>
<p>The reality is that we want to work with the CBRM. They have top-lined some estimates on some projects and as I said to the mayor, and he seemed to be quite open to this, you know we're willing to work with him to look at the projects on those lists, just as we did with the dredging of the harbour in Sydney, we were a full partner in that project. We look forward to being a full partner in other projects, along with the federal government and we're going to do that not just for CBRM but for the other parts of the province as well.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I announced today as part of the legislation that was tabled as well that we will be undertaking a third-party review of looking at the tools that we have at our disposal for economic development both through our department, through Innovacorp, through Nova Scotia Business Incorporated, to be able to identify exactly how it is we can help attract business to Cape Breton and throughout the province; how can we work with our existing entrepreneurs that we have in Cape Breton; how can we continue to build, for example, on the Credit Union Small Business Financing Program, which is at capacity and has been a tremendous success story and for which our government has committed to increasing the guarantee from 75 per cent to 90 per cent. Those are some of the initiatives that we're working on and we're always open to new ideas of how we can grow the economy not only of Cape Breton but all of Nova Scotia.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, Cape Breton has an unemployment rate of 12.5 per cent, and I'll table the document regarding that. That is 2 per cent higher than the North Shore, 3 per cent higher than the South Shore, 4.2 per cent higher than in Annapolis, and 6.1 per cent higher than Halifax. With more people looking for work and businesses pointing to energy as a major cost, this rate increase in January will certainly have a negative impact on business in Cape Breton and across Nova Scotia. Will the minister commit to working for the people of Cape Breton when it comes to stopping this energy increase by Nova Scotia Power?</p>

I know that a recent event that was held in our nation's capital to promote Cape Breton was very well received and hopefully is going to bring tremendous results.

Certainly after the minister's visit to Berwick, the e-mails to my office indicate a lot more questions. A rushed process through the URB, coupled with the fact that the Premier and the Minister of Energy either know and won't say or don't know and don't care what the deal will mean for power rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, hospitals have been challenged with increasing electricity rates under this government and the previous government, in fact. The most recent annual report of Capital District cites their increase in plant and utilities budget to increases in electricity rates. I will table that document.</p>

You know many Nova Scotians woke up Saturday morning to a stunning headline that said, "Nova Scotia energy minister welcomes approval of revised Maritime Link deal." How could that be? Isn't this the same fellow who just two weeks before told the Globe and Mail about the Maritime Link agreement, and I will table it when I finish this, "The document as submitted does not go far enough in terms of protecting ratepayers. It's as simple as that." I'll table both the documents.</p>

<p>What it means to our province and to the health authority, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the Muskrat Falls is stability, something that we've never seen under the former Liberal Government back in the 1990s.</p></speech>

            <p>What I learned upon becoming the Minister of Energy is that the previous government had no interest in getting improvements to protect ratepayers in the Maritime Link deal and yet in eight weeks, in appearing at the board, and in discussions with our federal partners, we were able to get changes. Mr. Speaker, what changed is all eight conditions were met, and for the benefit of the House since the member obviously hasn't looked at it, I will table the opinion put together by legal staff and others showing where, in the board's decision, each one of the conditions were actually met in full or exceeded.</p>

CORBETT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I know the minister would dearly love to rewrite history but the reality is that he has been against the Maritime Link and has been on record. What I want to do is remind him on September he sent out a press release accusing the government of the day of forcing a misguided and expensive deal on the ratepayers in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I'll table that original press release, but for some reason we couldn't find it on the Liberal Party's Web site because it had been removed. Fortunately we did a little research and we found the Energy Minister's remarks on a little Web site called <a href="http://www.reelectkeith.ca/">www.reelectkeith.ca</a>. I'll table that also.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, my question is, did the cost of Maritime Link change since September? If so, by how much?</p></speech>

Turning off the lights in operating rooms is not an option. Reducing the hours of operation of hospitals and scaling back on the delivery of health care is not an option.</p>
<p>Despite this NDP Government's boasting that this is a good deal, not one person in government can or will tell anyone how much power will be. Why would the Minister of Health and Wellness champion a multi-billion dollar project if he doesn't know whether there will be a negative impact on the delivery of front-line health care services?</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I know that Nova Scotians want government to react to the increased costs of electricity over the last number of years. We've been shackled to fossil fuel costs for decades - decades. We have to do things differently, and that's why we're doing things differently in community services, in education, in health care. We're going to do the same thing with energy. We cannot do what the former governments have done and shackle ourselves to fossil fuel, we need to have a diversified renewable electrical source of energy here in the Province of Nova Scotia, and the Muskrat Falls project will not only create economic wealth in the province, but it will allow us to really have control of our own destiny when it comes to energy here in Nova Scotia - something we've never had for many years, and we blame it both on the Liberals and Tories of the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the only person rewriting history is the NDP because they are upset that we were able to actually do the things that we said they should do when they were government. Let me quote from the Canadian Press article on July 24, 2013 - two quotes from that. One: "One thing the Liberals and NDP actually agree on is that the government needs to get electricity from Lower Churchill to meet its energy quota." Then we said, "Both opposition parties &#x2026;" - that's these guys and us - " &#x2026; are careful to state they're not necessarily opposed to the Lower Churchill project, only to the NDP's handling of it." I'll table that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, that was before the election and we can now say what the energy price would have been. We now have the ability to protect ratepayers. The board now has the authority, with the bill we introduced today, to have oversight on it. Every single word of testimony that was before that board hearing now forms part of the Energy Access Agreement and that was not part of the deal championed by the NDP when they were government. (Applause)</p></speech>
          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>MR. GLAVINE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a lot of blame going around. I would love to see the $3 billion or $4 billion that Muskrat Falls will cost the Nova Scotia ratepayer be invested in Nova Scotia in our innovative companies to produce energy.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest users of electricity in this province are hospitals. Every other hospital in this country has been spared the 30 per cent three-year increase in energy costs that this NDP Government has allowed. Again, they remain silent, and the impact of the unknown is as challenging to hospital budgets as it is to Nova Scotians' pocketbooks.</p>
<p>Could the Minister of Health and Wellness please indicate for all members of the House what impact the multi-billion dollar Muskrat Falls deal will have on the ability for hospitals to deliver front-line health care services past 2017?</p></speech>

He knows he was against it. His Leader was trumpeting Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec wherever he could. But of course you know the Liberal Government did submit these eight foibles but, to the credit of the URB, they tossed them out the door, so I don't know why this guy keeps going back to say we've got the eight commitments. He sounds like Neville Chamberlain, peace in our time. He's wrong, Mr. Speaker.</p>

Right now we don't know how much power is going to be next year, but I know under the Muskrat Falls agreement, when that power comes into Nova Scotia it's going to be more stable, the lowest power rate that we can get here in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I want to thank all those health administrators, the health authorities across the province who have worked extremely hard over the last three years to control costs. We're being recognized on a national stage, on some of the innovation that we've had not only in health care but in other areas, by Ministers of Health who are Liberals, who are Conservatives, who are looking at our model here in Nova Scotia - not only in health care but in other areas of departments and services that we provide. We're not going to do what the Liberals did when they were in power - when it came to health care, they allowed health care authorities to run huge deficits. Our health authorities are running balanced budgets, they're doing it in a responsible way, and we're going to continue to work with them in that manner.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the previous government took a road show around the province, championing the previous deal. They said to the board in July that it should be approved without conditions. Yes, I did read the board's ruling and I have also tabled the analysis by the legal staff that shows that they are all met, so not only do I think that the legal staff have met that and they have made themselves available to any member of the Opposition to also explain it.

The residents of Fall River, Waverley, Windsor Junction, as well as additional traffic from Bedford, Sackville and Beaver Bank, are very concerned about the potential for accidents, accidents that occur on both Highway No. 102 and Highway No. 118 due to safety issues and the high speed. Highway No. 102 at Fall River Exit 5 in the a.m. and Highway No. 118 in the p.m. at Exit 14 to Fall River - both have blocked traffic lining up and stopped on the 100-Series Highway, and thus the potential to result in major accidents.</p>

<p>A couple of things that we did, and it is a safety concern I think that all members, when you come, where Highway No. 118 and Highway No. 102 converge in particular, is a very important area for traffic. I think it's 30,000 vehicles per day which is a large number. We've done a couple of things. First of all, one of the big pressure relievers that we've put into place, which was indicated in our Throne Speech, is Highway No. 107 Burnside connector. That's going to affect traffic all in the metro area, particularly during the drive times. We're also looking at some of the changes and improvements we can make at the Fall River exit.

<p>In closing, Mr. Speaker, it is a very important question. We're going to work with the member and work with the department as best we can to help in that area because it is important and unlike the previous government, we're going to listen to all our caucus members and we're going to get things done for Nova Scotians.</p></speech>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, I have to say the honourable member's idea of audacity and mine are quite different. My idea of audacity is putting tolls on the highways of Nova Scotia.

Full-time jobs in Nova Scotia have been disappearing over the last four years in Nova Scotia. We have lost 11,300 full-time jobs. Please allow me to table this document. People who need jobs won't stop needing jobs while the Liberal Government drags its feet. Nova Scotia Power is set to increase power bills by another 3 per cent this January. We have seen power rates impact job creation before and now they're climbing again.</p>
<p>My question, Mr. Speaker, is will the minister stand up for the job creators by saying no to the 3 per cent power rate increase?</p></speech>

MICHEL SAMSON</from><p>Mr. Speaker, we are certainly cognizant of the challenges that are being faced throughout Nova Scotia which is why today in tabling legislation we did announce there would be a third-party review of the economic development tools that we use here in Nova Scotia to ensure that they are the best tools possible to work with our small business, with our larger enterprises, in order to help foster economic growth in this province.</p>
<p>One of the success stories that we have had, Mr. Speaker, has certainly been through the Credit Union Small Business Loan Program which, as I mentioned, is currently oversubscribed, which is a wonderful thing and as well, which our government through our Premier has committed to extending the guarantee from 75 per cent to 90 per cent which is, once again, hopefully going to help more and more small businesses in Nova Scotia grow.</p></speech>

However, 53 per cent of respondents in the CFIB Business Barometer point to fuel and energy as a major cost constraint. Once again, I'll document and table document number two. These cost constraints are still their major concerns and are not waiting. They need real attention right now. Our small business owners cannot afford to hire more people due to the rising costs of energy.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, proof that we are turning the corner is when, in the Fall, we announced PROJEX Engineering coming from Calgary to Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is when we announced that IBM was going to locate here in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is when we made those investments in companies in Cape Breton. Further proof of that is when we signed on with Muskrat Falls to create jobs and stable energy prices in the Province of Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is Nova Centre, right across the street, when we signed on along with the federal government to create more employment, to create a brighter future for all Nova Scotians. The proof is truly in the pudding.</p>

There are 4,000 fewer people employed on the Island over the last year. So what proof is that that Nova Scotians need about the state of the economy?</p>
<p>The minister knows full well that if there were not work outside the province, these numbers would be much higher and better reflect the grim reality we're facing on the Island. The minister just suggested that an influx of jobs related to Muskrat Falls for Cape Breton. The only things we've learned about the NSP jobs plan for Cape Breton is that the Lingan will be closing if the link comes online. The economy of Cape Breton desperately needs a boost.</p>
<p>My question is, will the minister tell Cape Bretoners how a 17 per cent unemployment rate and thousands of jobs lost is "turning the corner," and how many jobs will be created in Cape Breton as a result of the Maritime Link?</p></speech>

We asked the previous government to ensure that it didn't happen before the decision was made by the board.</p>
<p>It is countries like Venezuela and Belize that take independent decisions of boards and then overrule them, which would create significant upheaval in the economy of Nova Scotia. So, Mr. Speaker, if the honourable member would like this government to act like Venezuela or so forth, we know where they want to go.

I said the previous government should be down there and stop decisions of the board before they were made, absolutely. This was a decision that was made and if the honourable member - and honestly, the Leader of the Official Opposition should know better, since he champions himself as a chartered accountant, but we go with what we have.</p>
<p>The reality is that he and that member should know that there would be a worse impact to the economy and to the economic markets by retroactively overruling the decision of an independent board at this late date.

<p>During the election campaign this Liberal Government promised to cut 1 per cent from the department budgets.

          <speech by="#13787640-1a96-4b80-8d04-ce79410f4a22"><from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to stand in my place and speak to Bill No. 17, a Blueprint for the Future of Public Education in Nova Scotia Act. It can also be called a comprehensive review of the public school program. We know that the public school program impacts every student in our province who attends public schools and we know that it's a broad range of policies, goals, outcomes, procedures, assessment tools, strategies, whatever.</p>
<p>We know that it's important if we're going to have a look at how we deliver public school programs that we take the time not to tinker around the edges, not to pick something off when the public seems to think it's the topic of the day and hope that we're responding to that. What we're looking at is a complete, comprehensive review so things like the school review process as one of the parts of the public school program would be part of that comprehensive review.</p>
<p>That public school program, Mr. Speaker, will be the goals and policies that shape the way we deliver public school programs. We have a number of students who are in our public school system who rely on and depend on a curriculum that will provide them with the skills and the training, the information they need when they graduate. It's important that the government takes a look at, are those current, are those relevant, are those curriculums that we are offering ones that are in the best interest of our students?</p>
<p>We know that we are currently asking our students to go out into an environment that is different than it was 10 years ago. We know that the jobs they will be going into will require different skills, and we have to make sure that what we're offering is designed to meet those needs.</p>
<p>Unless you ask the question, Mr. Speaker, of, what is it that we want our students to know when they graduate - what skills do we expect them to have, what skills do the employers want them to have - then we need to ask, is the curriculum that we are offering appropriate and is it providing an opportunity for them to have those skills?</p>
<p>We know that with the advances in technology that many of our students are going into high-tech positions so the question is, are we providing a curriculum that helps meet that? A comprehensive review of the public school program will allow people who are experts in their field to look at that. For example, with respect to employment opportunities, we would be making sure that those people who are in our businesses that are hiring these young people have some input into whether the graduate that they're receiving is well trained. Does the graduate that's coming to them now fit the job description that they have?</p>
<p>Until we have a review of that, we don't know. We hear from some of those employers who say, no, who say the skills these kids have aren't matching up with the jobs that we have available so it's time to bring those people in and let them be part of a review that would help us design a curriculum that will better respond to the student needs.</p>
<p>We know that when our students go off to university or community college that we want them to be as well prepared as possible and we want them to be able to transition into a post-secondary learning institute with some degree of success. In order to do that we need to know what it is that universities are looking for in our young kids. So a comprehensive review does require bringing in experts who can help shape the public school system in the future.</p>
<p>We know that in our current system we have a model of inclusion and we have heard people who say that model is not working. So if we're going to change the model, we need to look at what's good about the model that we have and hang onto that, and what needs to be changed. Again, that calls for us to bring in people who have some expertise, and in many cases that will be your parents and your teachers who come in and say, this is what I found with the inclusion model that we currently have.</p>
<p>We have in our schools very diverse learning needs. As a result, we have something to be very proud of in the province. Over the last number of years we have been very successful in early identification, early intervention, and early response to special needs that students have. We have information that we didn't have 10 years ago about learning styles and also how you match a program to an individual's learning style so that they can have success. If we're not motivated by what's in the best interests of our students and how the program can best meet their needs, then we have failed our students. In order to make sure that what we're doing and how we're doing it and what we're delivering is the best it can possibly be, you need to have that review.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this bill provides the framework for that to happen. That doesn't mean that everything will change, but it does mean that before something is changed we look at the impact it is going to have on our students and we don't introduce something, wait to see what the outcome is, realize it was wrong, and then start scrambling to pull it back. Unfortunately we've seen some of that tinkering in the last four years and, unfortunately, our students are paying a price for that. We need to make sure that we don't do that, that we understand the consequences - both positive and negative - of any decisions and any changes that we make, and that we provide a program that responds to those.</p>
<p>I talked about the inclusion model, and about the diverse needs of the students in our schools. Statistics tell us that 1 in every 10 people has some form of learning disability. Now, if you can imagine that - and you certainly can't apply that consistently, 1 in 10 - but if you have a class of 25 or 30 students, you could have three, on average you could have three. You may have seven and you may have two. But we know that you will be hard-pressed to find classrooms in this province that don't have some students there who have a learning disability. And we need to make sure that our teachers, who are trying to respond to the needs of these students, also are aware of the best learning style for that particular student, and match a program to that.</p>
<p>Talk about autism as an example. And this is probably one of the best examples of where we have progressed with early identification. We know that in the 1990s, we had one in 1,000 students, it has jumped to one in 88 students in our schools who are on some part of the autism disorder spectrum. Those numbers are huge and our teachers who are in our classrooms are trying to keep up with understanding the disability, understanding the condition, and responding to it. For many of them, that has never been part of their teacher training program, their B.Ed. program, or any other kind of professional development. So if we want to be able to fully respond, we have to be able to give our teachers the professional development that they need, that they have not gotten when they were in a B.Ed. program, but that they have the background knowledge and the skills that they need, so, professional development and how it's delivered, part of the public school program.</p>
<p>There are so many different programs and policies that do have a direct impact on kids, and normally we think they don't. We normally think policies are broad-ranging and by the time you filter down to a student in the class, it has very little impact. But it certainly does not. I will go back and use it probably as one of the policies that has the greatest impact, and people, I don't think, recognize the seriousness of it, and that is inclusion. I mentioned that before. We have a policy, and I strongly support the policy of inclusion. Every child in the province has a right to a public education. And we have a responsibility to provide them with the best education possible. So it's not a question of, do we have a policy on inclusion? The question is, is the model that we're using to deliver programs to students the best model? Are we able to help every child as best we can so that they can reach their full potential?</p>
<p>You know, we look at what's happening in our schools now, where funding is cut to our public schools, it has been cut the last three years. And what's happening is that schools are trying to deliver more with less. Many school boards are working very hard, and making tough decisions to protect the classroom. But we have a number of kids whose needs are very demanding, and those needs, and those programs, are very costly. So when you decide that you're going to cut funding from public schools because the enrolment has gone down, I think it's a big mistake. Just because the numbers have gone down doesn't mean that the needs of the students there have changed. In fact, as I've said, the research that we have shows that their needs are more complex and more diverse. We know more about how we can provide programing for them, and we know that those programs are costly.</p>
<p>We have to make sure that we don't make short-sighted decisions, and that we don't, as I said, tinker around the edges and pull $65 million out, or pull a program out, or do this or do that without recognizing and asking ourselves a question: what will this do to the child in my class who is autistic, who needs support from a TA or an EA, who cannot cope in a busy environment? What does that mean for that child? Boards have made tough decisions, and they have made those decisions in the best interests of kids, but they cannot continue.</p>
<p>So what we're saying is, let's look at what it is that we need to be offering and how we offer it, and what it is that kids need when they graduate, and make sure that the skills that they have match those that are in the labour market as being a demand. Let's also make sure that they have the skills that they need so they can be successful in post-secondary education.</p>
<p>This particular bill, Bill No. 17, provides an opportunity for that comprehensive review, which would include those experts who need to come in and help us formulate a public school program that will meet the needs of every student in our province. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

Today in Question Period we saw something that hasn't been done in this House in my almost 16 years here, and that was a question asked by a government backbencher. It has been the tradition of this House, it's my understanding, that Question Period would be by the Opposition Parties and by independent members. That has been my recollection.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I ask you to make a ruling on this. We did have a conversation with the Government House Leader and I voiced my opposition to this. I would appreciate that we would carry on with the usual practice of this House: that questions during Question Period come from members of the Opposition and any independent members there happen to be. Thank you.</p></speech>

Something that the Premier had said was that we all want to work together in making this House a better place. We had this discussion with the Government House Leader, both of us had said, why don't we let the Committee on Assembly Matters look at this one more specifically and look at it as a whole issue when it comes to all the practices of this House.</p>
<p>When it comes to this question, it has not been the tradition of this House for government members to ask ministers questions - not that there wasn't a good question or a bad question, it was the fact that it's not the tradition of this House. Plus, the issue is as well, I thought there was an air of co-operation, to be able to get along with this. Both of us oppose that and yet it is still here before us, Mr. Speaker, and I do ask that you make a ruling on this one as well.</p></speech>

Here in this House Nova Scotians have clearly said they were upset with the way this House was functioning and were looking upon us to bring about change to the way we do our duties here at the House.</p>
<p>There are going to be further reviews that will take place. Today was an example of starting to implement change. All elected members of this House have a responsibility to their constituents to represent them in the best way possible. Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to you that having a government member ask a question on every 10<sup>th</sup> question is not unreasonable.

GARY RAMEY</from><p>It gives me great pleasure today to speak for a few minutes on Bill No. 17, the Blueprint for the Future of Public Education in Nova Scotia Act. I think I'm reasonably well qualified to say a few things about this. I taught in the public school system for a few years, and then in the community college system for quite a few years, and also at the University of Alberta. I think I've got a reasonable range of experience there.</p>
<p>I also think it's important to examine what the purpose of an education is. The purpose of an education, in my opinion, is to become an independent learner and not to become a fact memorizer. I was in Public Accounts today and I was listening to one of the people there, Dr. Lowe, and he was recounting a situation where he talked about learning about the unification of Italy - Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Victor Manuel II and that sort of thing. My response back to him was learning about the repeal of the Corn Laws in England in 1846 and the economic impact it had on Great Britain. Nothing wrong with learning that, of course, and it may be very valuable at some point in my life, I don't know.</p></speech>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#13283a7f-b97c-4254-a233-d0ccec196703"><from>MR. RAMEY</from><p>Maybe even in this debate, I don't know. But really, the purpose of an education is to become an independent learner so you don't need a teacher, so that you can learn things yourself. Because the education system in any province, including this one, is not static but ever-changing, the education system has to be looked at intensely critically at all points in time. It doesn't necessarily require experts from any particular field to come in and tell us what we need to do. Some of it, I think, is pretty obvious, and maybe even as plain as the nose on our faces.</p>
<p>I do also want to say that in Nova Scotia, at least from my experience - and there are quite a few other teachers in this room. I think the member for Kings West - we were accusing him of being from someplace else earlier on today, but Kings West - and the member for Timberlea-Prospect, and the member for Guysborough-Sheet Harbour, and all kinds of them - the member for Hants East. There are a lot of teachers and a lot of people with experience in teaching in here, as well as the Minister of Education, and of course, Halifax Citadel-Sable Island as well.</p>
<p>There are a number of members in this House who have a pretty good idea of the education system and what it's all about. I would like to say to all teachers in the Province of Nova Scotia how much we appreciate what they do every day. It's not an easy job. Surprisingly, and I think a lot of the teachers in here would admit this, it's sometimes a very lonely job. Even though you're surrounded by people, it's sometimes a very lonely job.</p>
<p>I guess my argument would be, Madam Speaker, that over the past year, and actually since we've been elected, we have introduced a number of changes and we have introduced a plan, and that plan is called Kids and Learning First. I think that particular plan produces some very good results for us now and in the future.</p>
<p>Over that time that I'm referring to, Madam Speaker, since we've been elected, we have launched or expanded several initiatives to help our young people succeed in the classroom. I concur, by the way - and I'd like to thank the member who spoke previously, many of the things she said I absolutely concur with. Just a few of these initiatives that we've introduced include: more help for young readers, and we know that's an essential skill that you absolutely have to have if you want to become an independent learner; more time for math; a new resource for students with autism spectrum disorder, and we know that's something that was in much demand by our population; keeping class sizes low; and I particularly like this one, a credit that encourages students to practice leadership in their communities because what we all ultimately become when we graduate from school is we all become citizens and it's not a bad idea to know what a good one is.</p>
<p>We undertook these initiatives that I'm referring to, and others as well, because the education system faced and continues to face a number of challenges. More and more money, for instance, was being spent every year on education, but our students weren't necessarily doing any better on their assessments.</p>
<p>We did review the education system and we did listen to - and here are the experts I like to listen to - families, teachers, school boards and community members. They told us quite clearly that we had to do things differently. The result of that was the Kids and Learning First strategy.</p>
<p>We also made changes to the funding model for school boards to ensure that there was fair and equitable funding for all the boards. We are also increasing funding to school boards this year; per-student funding is going up 3 per cent and per-student funding now will be at its highest level ever in this province. Of course new teachers will be hired this year, Madam Speaker, as well.</p>
<p>Now the increased funding will also mean more psychologists, more speech pathologists and other experts for students with special needs. My wife actually is a speech pathologist who is retired now, but had worked in the school system for years and told me that on many occasions pre-Primary screening is where you caught a lot of the potential problems that might develop in the future; auditory discrimination problems being one of them. If you have auditory discrimination problems you have trouble decoding words, sounding out words and, therefore, you are going to have trouble reading. If you can nip that in the bud, you are way ahead of the game and that's what we should be doing.</p>
<p>So special education like my colleague, the member for Colchester North, said is very important to the government. The province is providing more help for students and families who need that extra support and that, of course, is essential.</p>
<p>We've increased funding for other special education projects as well. An initiative like SchoolsPlus will be available in 98 schools - which is quite a few - at a cost of $2.5 million. That's a model that I've never gone anywhere where I haven't heard good things about it.</p>
<p>I want you to know, too, that we've got about 120,500 students in school in Nova Scotia and we learned this morning - those of us who were at the Public Accounts Committee - that we have about 850 students who are home-schooled. The province committed $1.4 million, too, for something else that I think is very important and that is for mental health clinicians to work alongside guidance counsellors in all SchoolsPlus schools. We know there are mental health issues in young people's backgrounds. We know that some of those people will not go to a clinical setting in a hospital to get help and we know if we bring the service to them, they are much more likely to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>For the first time, Madam Speaker, the province has an action plan to take on something else that's a heartbreaking issue, and many members in here have spoken about it, and that is the issue of bullying. There are probably very few of us who haven't been bullied at some time in our lives ourselves. Sadly, there are people in adulthood who still continue to be bullied.</p>
<p>Speak Up, which is an action plan to address bullying and cyberbullying behaviour, includes more than 40 actions to help reduce the number of incidents of bullying. And this plan takes on bullying and cyberbullying in many ways to get at the root causes of the behaviour and reduce its effects on our young people. We know that the bully is often the individual with the problem, not the person who's getting bullied. Bullying is a community-wide issue that needs a community response, and the Speak Up plan, I'm proud to say, reflects that.</p>
<p>That plan has met, by the way, with accolades, and is being looked at by other provinces as a model, Madam Speaker, and it fits in with some of the other things that have been happening here as well, which is our Better Care Sooner plan, which is also, in a completely different dimension, being picked up by provinces like Saskatchewan and P.E.I.</p>
<p>Now, we've also been helping students by expanding opportunities for workplace learning. Madam Speaker, new skilled trades centres announced for Cole Harbour and Forest Heights, which is down in the Chester Basin, Lunenburg County area, will let students explore trades like construction and transportation. Just on that note, I know the member for Colchester North was speaking about trying to get the programs in schools to line up or sync better with what business people want - let's say people in manufacturing or construction, or whatever - and I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>What happened in the community college system, for instance, there are advisory boards for all the trades, and those advisory boards consist of people from the business community who come in and advise the staff at the college on exactly what sort of skills are required, and that gets translated down into the high school system as well. I had started something when I was at the community college in Bridgewater called a vocational transition program, where we used to bring high school students in one day a week - it was on Fridays - introduce them to trades. They'd do a circuit - one a month through four different trade areas - and then if they decided to come to the college after, they got advanced admission status. And that sort of morphed into O2 later on.</p>
<p>The co-op program - and co-op programs I'm totally in favour of, by the way - which gives students hands-on experience in a workplace, is now available in 85 of the province's 87 high schools. And the Options and Opportunities program is a big success with students and employers around the province.</p>
<p>So, Discovering Opportunities will allow students in Grade 9 - we're starting early here - to learn more about workplace learning and opportunities available to them, Madam Speaker, and the new Personal Development Credit allows students to earn a credit for developing skills in leadership, languages, and the arts, through community-based programs like Junior Achievement and Cadets. Those Junior Achievement programs, for those who have participated - and some of the people who have been teachers in here probably have participated in those, and others as well - are absolutely top-notch. If you want to get a dose of reality on any given day, and you go to be a mentor in one of those programs, you can learn a lot yourself.</p>
<p>These initiatives have also been met with high praise, Madam Speaker. For instance, Valerie Payn, the president of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce - I think most people know who she is - says, " &#x2026; Kids and Learning First has a strong focus on supporting teachers and equipping students for opportunities in Nova Scotia's growing economy." And we know we're going to need those students because of some of the work that is booked in our future. She says, "Programs like co-op, skilled trades and personal development bridge the gap between learning and doing, giving students access to mentors in the business and entrepreneurial sectors." And a big dose of reality for a good number of students is what's absolutely required.</p>
<p>You know I always used to be moderately put off when I would go to a university registration day and I'd walk into the place where the students were buying their books, and on the wall of the place where they were doing it, which was often in a library or something, there would be a huge cardboard cut-out of a cheque hanging on the wall so that students who were buying their books and had never written a cheque in their lives - and they were like, let me see, 18 or 19 years old, and going off on their own to study independently - would have this template there so they would know how to fill out a cheque.</p>
<p>You see, there's some kind of a disconnect there, I think, in the practicality of an education. I mean, you're going to have to rent an apartment or a house, you're going to have to get a mortgage, you're possibly going to have to write a cheque at some time in your life, so it might be a good idea to learn those things somewhere on the way through the system.</p>
<p>Carol Logan, the director of Human Resources for the Prince George Hotel, which has been a great partner in our O2 program, has said that her firm appreciates the chance to give students valuable work experience and help train the workforce of the future. That's great feedback from those who deal day after day with young people.</p>
<p>This House will hear in the budget how we are doing more to help children before they start school. Our children deserve the best possible start in life to help them develop to their full potential. Catch it early, get it looked after, move on. The budget will continue on our strong commitment to help parents and children, and before I take my place - which I'm rapidly coming to the end of this - I'd also like to add a few other successes.</p>
<p>The students in our International Baccalaureate program are the best in the world. Our Grade 4 students were the best in Canada when it comes to reading. More parents than ever before are learning how to help their children make good career choices through the Parents as Career Coaches program, and I could go on and on. Under the Kids and Learning First plan, we are indeed turning the corner on education as we are turning the corner in so many other areas.</p>
<p>With those few words, Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for allowing me this time today and I will graciously take my place.</p></speech>

            <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
            <p>The honourable Minister of Communications Nova Scotia.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#1e5b7bdc-363b-4df4-8258-edcf8f2bf7fb"><from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from><p>I'll first move that Bill No. 7, an Act to Amend Chapter 376 of the Revised Statues, 1989, the Public Service Act, Respecting the Office of Communications Nova Scotia now be read a second time.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased in October to be named the Minister of Communications Nova Scotia. As ministers it is our responsibly to make sure that the resources we have in our departments are used in the most effective way possible, in the best interest of taxpayers. In the case of Communications Nova Scotia I learned a couple of things right away that needed to change. Communications Nova Scotia had no guiding legislation and it is currently impossible to determine how much the government as a whole spends on advertising. This isn't acceptable. Whether it's a business or a government, we need to be able to tell people how much is being spent and what it's being spent on.</p>
<p>The legislation I'm introducing today, along with the policies and guidelines, will address these issues. I want to be clear that at the same time as bringing forward the bill we have brought forward the draft policy and guidelines so the people can review those, as well, and provide their comment. The legislation compels departments and offices to use Communications Nova Scotia services, ensures that adverting is non-partisan, and holds ministers accountable for communication services procured outside of CNS and outside of proper procurement services. This is the first time this will be done.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, amending the Public Service Act will ensure that government communications are relevant to government policies and priorities, that they are factual, respectful, and designed to meet objectives. The legislation clearly lays out a range of services provided by the agency and states clearly that all government departments and offices must use CNS for their communications activities. We will be able to track advertising and ensure that it meets standards, to make sure that it is not partisan, and we will also be able to do things such as prohibiting hyper sexualized images in government advertising.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, in the past four years we've seen examples of advertising that should never have come from government. We've seen examples of hyper sexualized images in advertising, and we've also seen examples of advertising which crossed the line and did not promote a particular government program or service. Already some of the advertising that is running on TV that I've signed off on as Minister of Communications Nova Scotia has taken away the slogans and is focused solely on the message and the identifier that the advertising is sponsored and paid for the Government of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, perhaps of most interest to you as Speaker of the Legislature, the bill will require me or any future Minister of Communications Nova Scotia to table an annual report on the paid advertising in the House of Assembly. Transparency and accountability are priorities for this government and this legislation will hold us accountable when it comes to communications services.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians have already noticed, going around the province, that unlike previous administrations when they came in and changed the minister's name on signs, highway signs for example, signs on libraries, on schools, we've taken them down; we haven't replaced them with signs with the minister's name. As much as the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal might like to drive down the highway and see his name on the way into the Legislature, we've decided that that's the wrong thing to do and we haven't done that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, this government has no intention of using communications services for political gain. The legislation clearly delineates the non-partisan role of Communications Nova Scotia; it gives the authority to CNS to turn down advertising and gives them authorities they have never had before. This is important to us, but it's also important to the staff at Communications Nova Scotia. They have not had this ability to say no before.</p>
<p>Communications Nova Scotia needs to be focused on communicating about government programs and services in Nova Scotia; it needs to be a facilitator. In a few moments I'll be leaving to join the Minister of Agriculture to announce an investment that Communications Nova Scotia is making in the local economy. And that's the sort of thing that Communications Nova Scotia should be doing, trying to foster investments in local businesses, in our local industry, and ensuring that people are aware of the programs and services available to them in a non-partisan way.</p>
<p>They need to be focused on helping Nova Scotians understand what their government is doing and why, and this legislation will allow them to do just that while improving Nova Scotians' confidence in government.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, as we move forward there will be a number of changes in terms of how Communications Nova Scotia operates. This was a very important first step because as long as having this guiding legislation was delayed, and as long as it wasn't there with the ability to do these things, it meant a delay in that accountability to the Legislature and to the people of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>This is a first step. This means that Nova Scotians will know what the guidelines are, what the rules are behind advertising and communications services. This means, Mr. Speaker, that Nova Scotians will know each year how much their government has spent on advertising, using their tax dollars, and what that was spent on.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, we will be publicly accountable to this. The legislation and guidelines will always be on-line, of course, and open to comment. I've already indicated to the Opposition Parties that we welcome their input on the guidelines and policy before it is ultimately approved by Cabinet after this bill passes, and I do welcome their suggestions because this is about making it work for the people of Nova Scotia, not the Party that is in power now, not the Party that could be in power at some point in the future - this is about making it work for Nova Scotians. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#b67194ee-eead-4e8d-9cdb-2d1935c5be52"><from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for bringing this bill forward. It all sounds very good, so when we can give a bit of credit here, credit will be given - I know he's having a bit of a heart attack over there.</p>
<p>We have been saying that the intent of this bill is to improve government communications by ensuring non-partisan ads and more accountability to taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, we do hope that the new government will fully implement the spirit of the bill in their day-to-day operations, although we do remain a little skeptical. Hopefully time will change that, based on the past history of government flip-flops over the last bit.</p>
<p>You know the legislation, as it is, lacks power to compel departments and offices to use CNS for non-partisan services or projects, so maybe it needs a little more power in that respect; it also neglects to hold ministers accountable for communications services that were procured outside the proper processes of CNS; and we do hope that this new legislation will help to rein in the outrageous spending of CNS in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>In 2002 CNS received about $3 million and had 89 staff listed on its payroll, according to the Finance Department. A decade later the agency's budget increased to $9.2 million and it employed 125 people as of March 31, 2012. CNS said the increase in payroll was in relation to the increase in demands of the previous NDP Government. I hope that this will change under the new government, as there will be no further partisan demands.</p>
<p>I also hope that this amendment will go beyond signage; as we know, in today's world, advertising is more than just signage and partisan messages can be conveyed in many mediums and sometimes the line to what is and what is not advertising can be blurred.</p>
<p>Now, we just have to think back maybe a year or a year and a half ago, two years ago - how long has it been now? - back to the Ships Start Here campaign. A perfect example of taxpayer-funded political advertising, a total campaign cost of $1.4 million, Mr. Speaker, with direct provincial government spending making up $620,000 for it. This advertising was largely made up in Atlantic Canada and clearly used by the previous government to take credit for the win.</p>
<p>Minister Peter MacKay would agree in saying the following about the positive decision for the $25 billion shipbuilding contract, "That was entirely a waste of money and had zero impact on the decision today. The decision today was based on merit. Any lobbying, advertising, arm-twisting, tub-thumping was just like pouring that money into Halifax Harbour. It made no impact on the decision."</p>
<p>Now, I would agree with the minister, and I know many people in this House would agree with it as well, and hopefully this new legislation will bring an end to wasting taxpayer dollars on such a politically motivated venture.</p>
<p>You know what, Mr. Speaker? Even though it was politically motivated and we know it was politically motivated, it really didn't help them in the last election. We look forward to seeing the annual report that will come from the minister on paid advertising to Executive Council. We will also continue to hold the minister to account for all the activity within the department and to ensure transparency and accountability for taxpayers. And with that, I thank the minister again for bringing this bill forward and look forward to the comments during this discussion.</p></speech>

It's a bill, I think when you listen to the words of the previous speaker, that there was really no hand on the wheel for a long time and I was one of those ministers, you know, it's public record. There was no hand at the wheel so to speak over at CNS. So, you know, if at any time we can honestly and forthrightly bring forward legislation that brings the true responsibility of a department under the auspices of, especially your watchful eye, Mr. Speaker, as it comes to the annual report being submitted here, we and my Party will support it. It's a good idea. I don't agree wholeheartedly with everything that the previous speaker had said but nonetheless what I will agree with is the position, if you will, of the government who's saying that this is what we want to do. I fundamentally agree with that and we fundamentally agree with that. So we hope that's the direction it stays in.</p>
<p>We will support the government in this and this is not a slogan or a catchphrase but this is one of the issues that I think truly we should be able to be on the same side on because it should be about informing Nova Scotians, Mr. Speaker.

But I'd like to start by telling the general public and the teachers out there how much I respect what teachers are doing here in the Province of Nova Scotia under very difficult situations.</p>
<p>I just heard from the member opposite about all the success that the teachers and students of this province are having and that's working in an education system that has been going through a very tough time under this present government, which has cut over $65 million over the last few years from the Education budget. So our teachers and students must be really, really good to be able to succeed in a situation that's being cut, cut, cut.</p>
<p>I worry about a bill that insists it should be cited as a blueprint for the future of Nova Scotia because we've heard that with our bullying bills that have been introduced by the present government: more studying and reporting than actual enforcing or correcting the situation.</p>
<p>While no member of the House could argue against a comprehensive review of our public education system, one of the biggest questions I have is how much is it going to cost? The school review process that the NDP Government has gone through over the last few years must have cost the government a fortune. That money is money that could be put into the classroom on front-line education. By reviewing the present system, will it allow us to determine the future direction of the education system and will it allow us to predict what the future holds and how many students with certain requirements or certain types of education we will need, and if we are producing enough, are we going to start changing our curriculum in order to allow other areas of the education system to flourish?</p>
<p>How much will a comprehensive review of all provisions and aspects of the public school system total? To bring in experts, we know that's expensive. We've had lots of studying with our bullying situation, had all kinds of recommendations and the recommendations don't seem to be going anywhere. It's just another example of a Party working for appearances.</p>
<p>How many times do we need to talk about things? Madam Speaker, I would like to remind the House this is coming from a Party that hired a consultant to figure out how to run their small office.</p>
<p>The scope of this proposed legislation is vast; how deep are we going to go into the system? To what degree are we going to implement the proposed recommendations and how will it affect our students?</p>
<p>Bill No. 17 calls for a cross-jurisdictional review of curricula, methodology and assessment strategies. Is there any indication of how long this review is going to take, and if we're going to do a cross-Canada review, will it take even longer? We've been talking recently about Muskrat Falls and the intervener process and the URB - can the review be done in the time frame that's proposed and if not, will it be given more time if needed so that we can complete the proposed process? While a review of the public school system is important, again I ask, what's the cost to our taxpayers?</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, each member of the House knows that Education is one of the most important departments in government. We've heard many conversations about the education system in the last two years that I've been here and all of it is around finances and the ability of the education system to employ the proper numbers of people and proper kinds of teachers so our students can achieve quality education.</p>
<p>Having assurances that such a review would lead to improvements for our young people is very vital. We cannot afford to throw money away and study things that won't be implemented. It seems like right now both Parties have that feature in common. That being the philosophy that as long as it looks good, people will buy it. (Interruption) I did.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are smarter. Our province offers some of the best education in the world and they are doing that with massive cuts in their budget and massive cuts to the education system. They are making teachers work harder with less and students learn more with less. We need to make sure that the reassurances are available to our students, that the vast amount of money could be better spent and after the studying there is plenty of money available to implement the suggestions. I don't have to outline the details of the NDP and their marketing machine, that was laid out for all of us last week when we found out about Communications Nova Scotia and the amount of money it is spending.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope this bill is not more talking and less doing like our present bullying bill, all of the provisions and aspects of the public school system, we hope it doesn't become redundant. The question I have asked is what will Bill No. 17 uncover that the existing Council of Ministers of Education does not already uncover each year when it shares findings and best practices? Our Party wants to make sure that Bill No. 17 is the right move for Nova Scotia, that we're spending the right amount of money and that we're spending money in a direction that will take our students to the highest potential possible, and a bill that will make sure our teachers get the tools they need and deserve to survive and to provide quality education to our students.</p>
<p>We would like to see clear terms of reference that would guarantee a useful outcome. We believe it's important to know if a cross-jurisdictional review, like the one laid out in Bill No. 17, has been helpful in other provinces. It is extremely important that the terms outlined in Bill No. 17 will reveal the results that Nova Scotians and our school kids needs to survive. Our children benefit from an education system that is probably one of the best in the world. We want to make sure that continues and studying certain aspects of the education system is a great idea. Do we need to study all aspects? We want to make sure we put the tools in the hands of the teachers, and the educational assistants, and the students so that they can function in a world out there that's changing every day. We have to make sure that we know the upcoming trends in the work world and that we know the upcoming trends in the university system so that we can prepare our students to go out into a world and survive.</p>
<p>Not only survive but thrive, to make sure that we continue to have one of the best provinces in the country and to make sure that the students that we have in this province are able to compete with other students in this country for jobs that we know are short, and we know that people out there in our community are competing for jobs with people from all over this country, and quite frankly now from all over the world. With the IT situation we have, now people can work anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>We have a pile of unemployment in Cape Breton and people have to leave our island in order to find work and find good-paying jobs. We're hearing about all kinds of jobs that are being created in Cape Breton since the government has been in power, but we still have an unemployment rate of 17 per cent. I believe the number that has been tossed around is 6,400 jobs lost in the last year, and that is just jobs lost, that's not the people who are away working, who if they were put in that mix because there were not jobs here that number would be much higher and the unemployment rate would be a lot higher.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the constituency I live in has an unemployment rate of over 30 per cent, so we have to ensure that the education our children are receiving is quality education because it looks like they may have to move and compete - compete for jobs that are short and compete for jobs that thousands of others are competing for. We know to date that that education starts at early years, Primary to Grade 3. We work on our base, we make sure that children get the basis they need in reading and writing and math. We want to make sure that these students have in the system the tools they need to be able to learn - proper environment, proper tools, proper amount of teachers, proper amount of educational assistance.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that this bill allows that to happen, allows us to make sure that the numbers needed in teachers are there, that the students get the assistance they need, that the students who need more help get more help, and that the money is there for that to happen, because if they don't get it in the earlier grades they really have a tendency to struggle in later grades.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we want to all benefit from an improved education system, but we want to make sure it's cost-effective. We heard just today about the so-called moratorium being placed on school closures. We have some small schools in rural Nova Scotia that provide excellent education and we want to make sure that that education system remains there for years and years to come, but we want to make sure we don't spent all our money on studying it, make sure that the system, when we need it we can draw on it, that the money would be there to add an extra teacher if necessary, to add an extra book or set of books.</p>
<p>I know in the high school at home, the composite high school we have that has a trades program, one of the budget cuts in the last number of years was a book budget that was cut. Students were expected to share books, not to be able to take them home to continue at home but to share them with other students in other classrooms. Cuts to the education system don't allow us to buy those books to make sure people can survive.</p>
<p>By making sure that the money is there, that the finances are there, that the tools are there, we must ensure the best way to make improvements. We want to make sure the study doesn't cost more than it is going to cost to implement it.</p>
<p>I hope that when the studying is done, there's enough money left in that pocket to make sure that the education our children need is there and we have the money to provide that education because, as we've heard already, we have probably the best educators in the country. We know that because they're working with less, and we know we're producing some of the best students in the country because they are competing with other areas of the province, other areas of the country and, actually, quite frankly, parts of the world.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing more about this bill and we hope that it will provide what's necessary for our students to achieve in society. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#d20d446c-118f-4445-81f4-cf995b335391"><from>HON. RANDY DELOREY</from><p>Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 5, an Act to Ban the Importation of Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater, be now read a second time. This bill that we bring forward is designed to prevent the importing or transportation of fracking wastewater into Nova Scotia from other jurisdictions. This legislation imposes fines of up to $10,000 per day that the Act is violated. This bill is a step forward in protecting the environment and the health of Nova Scotians. We've heard that Nova Scotians don't want hydraulic fracturing unless we know it can be done safely in our geology of Nova Scotia. That's why there is currently a moratorium in place on hydraulic fracturing activity in this province as we await the independent report from Dr. Wheeler, which we expect to receive in the Spring of 2014.</p>
<p>Right now Nova Scotia has very few options to consider in the treatment and disposal of fracking wastewater. We've seen first-hand in this province how much work is involved in establishing a safe and effective means to treat this wastewater. We've seen this based upon the pilot programs that took place in Kennetcook and the treatment options being pursued in the Debert area of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Nova Scotians clearly do not want Nova Scotia to be seen as the waste dumping ground for other jurisdictions, and that's why we are moving forward with this particular piece of legislation.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Council of Canadians, the Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter, the Ecology Action Centre, the Responsible Energy Action group, and others who are giving Nova Scotians an organized voice on these and other environmental concerns. Concerns that have been raised by these organizations were echoed by citizens on the doorsteps during our campaign, and it fulfills our Party's election commitment to take action on this very important issue to address these concerns that Nova Scotians have.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hearing from my colleagues in the House as well as from other Nova Scotians during the Law Amendments Committee session. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#2c4ef79f-acb1-4c92-8ff4-e6bfac04ddc0"><from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, hydraulic fracturing has become a very important and contentious issue with Nova Scotians in recent years. There are those who would like to see the moratorium lifted and allow companies to explore our province's potential to produce shale gas, and there are those who believe that the environmental risks are too high.</p>
<p>Our caucus supports the moratorium on fracking and will maintain the support until we are shown scientific evidence that guarantees we can do it safely and without causing harm to our groundwater. We look forward to reviewing the Wheeler Report on fracking when it comes out in May 2014. As long as the moratorium remains in place, we believe that we should not allow the importation of fracking waste by-products from other provinces. Once the report is released in May, and should the government reverse the moratorium based on scientific discovery, we may find our province in a different situation with regard to accepting waste water from elsewhere. But, if we are still reviewing the environmental risks ourselves, then it is not responsible to accept waste water from our neighbours.</p>
<p>Our caucus has had a very clear position on hydraulic fracturing from the start. We will not support fracking in this province unless there is scientific proof that it will not endanger our groundwater. Environmental safety must be assured. There must be proven economic benefits and demonstrated support from the local community. Without those three conditions in place, there is little possibility of public confidence and support for hydraulic fracturing in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this bill will ensure that Nova Scotia is being responsible to its citizens. With fracking comes waste water; if Nova Scotia isn't ready for fracking, then we aren't ready to process the waste water. We know that there have been instances in the past where fracking waste by-products from other areas have ended up in Nova Scotia for treatment. The Minister of Environment says they are working on an initiative to safely treat and dispose of the waste water that has been sitting in holding ponds in Debert. I hope the minister will be forthcoming with any plans his department has to deal with this issue.</p>
<p>If the minister could provide members of this House with a timeline and details of what steps will be taken, it would be greatly appreciated. This has become too important an issue for us, as legislators, to not be made fully aware. Beyond my role as a member of this Assembly, as a mother it is important to me that we protect our environment for our children and future generations. We live in a beautiful province and it is our responsibility to maintain that. When the Wheeler report comes out in May and the government ultimately decides the province's position on fracking, I ask that the government make their decision based on science, to instill confidence in all Nova Scotians. We believe this is a responsible move by the province and as such the PC caucus will be supporting this bill.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#c479d7de-83a6-47c7-a045-07816407bdb3"><from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from><p>Mr. Speaker, as the NDP Environment Critic, I would like to be clear that our Party shares the concerns of Nova Scotians when it comes to hydraulic fracturing and its waste water. As the public's concern continues to grow over the process of fracking and the disposal of its waste water, these concerns are especially valid when considering the possibilities of environmental spills. This is why the NDP placed the moratorium on fracking two years ago and just last month the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities passed a resolution to support the NDP's province-wide moratorium. It's also why we secured the services of Dr. Wheeler to carry out the comprehensive, independent review of fracking that is currently taking place. I, like many Nova Scotians, am anxiously awaiting the results of that review.</p>
<p>On the surface of it the NDP has no issue with this bill. My only concern at this time is that in the Spring of 2011, the Liberals tabled a bill in this House that was essentially a wolf in sheep's clothing when it came to fracking. This bill - which I've heard the Energy Minister reference many times - was called an Act to Ensure the Health and Well-being of All Nova Scotians in the Use of Efficient Hydraulic Fracturing, and I can table that. Perhaps this is something the member for Halifax Chebucto is referring to when he talks about green fracking, which also sounds eerily close to the Conservative federal government's support for what they call ethical oil from the tar sands in Alberta.</p>
<p>While the bill did call for a temporary moratorium on fracking, it also called for an end to the same moratorium on fracking by November 15, 2011. One can easily argue that if the Liberals had their way three years ago, hydraulic fracturing could actually be taking place in Nova Scotia right now. At this point I don't believe the evidence demonstrates that fracking can be done safely in our province and other provinces are moving to ban hydraulic fracturing as well, like Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>As for this bill, there hasn't really been any fracking waste fluid shipped to Nova Scotia since 2011. However, members should note that our province is still working to address waste water from shale gas exploration in Kennetcook six years ago as well as waste fluid that was to be treated in a waste treatment company in Debert just outside of my riding. The Colchester Municipality has actually banned the disposal of fracking fluid in our county and I'm very pleased to see that happen. As such, it's unlikely that any materials would be shipped to the lone facility capable of processing waste fluids in Debert either way. So this bill is largely precautionary, but I believe you can't be too careful when it comes to fracking and we should not consider allowing Nova Scotia to be used as a dumping ground and disposal site for the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>My greatest concern is that this bill does nothing to prevent the Liberal Government from lifting the moratorium on fracking in Nova Scotia before all the scientific evidence has been collected and disposing of that fracking fluid off the coast of Nova Scotia. If that were to happen, this bill would essentially be rendered obsolete.</p>
<p>However, in closing Mr. Speaker, when good legislation is presented to the House of Assembly, legislation which hopefully serves to protect the safety of all Nova Scotians including the environment we live in, our ground water, our earth and the air we breathe, then members should support it from across all Party lines. This is really one of those situations where in the spirit of co-operation we can all help to clear the air both figuratively and literally. Therefore, I'm pleased to say that I and my NDP colleagues support this bill to ban the importation of hydraulic fracturing waste water. Thank you.</p></speech>

KARLA MACFARLANE</from><p>Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to rise before you and the rest of the members of this House and present my first Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your new position in this, the oldest legislative building in Canada. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, it is humbling to stand here and address you and the other members of the Legislature, where so many have stood since 1819. I would also like to congratulate both the new and returning members - we have all been charged with the responsibility of working for our constituents to the best of our abilities, and I am eagerly looking forward to working with each and every one of you.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, please allow me to take this opportunity to thank my amazing team in Pictou West who not only gave their time, energy, and financial contributions but also their friendship and unwavering faith and belief in me. Many good times and laughs were shared and many new friendships formed during the journey that led me here today. Someone said that you can tell how a campaign is going by how much the fun the team is having - well, then I stand here as a testament to that. From wine and cheese parties to impromptu lunches and late night suppers, from falling on ice, suffering skinned knees and twisted ankles, dog bites, braving all types of weather, to having to be towed out of snow banks, we have all managed to have a good time and a laugh at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, Mr. Speaker, my team was indispensable and I am grateful for each and every one of them and the role they played in my journey here. They are too numerous to name individually and, for fear of forgetting someone, I choose to thank them as a group, as they know who they are and their importance to me - I have expressed my gratitude and thanks to them all personally.</p>
<p>There are two people I would like to single out today - my children - my daughter, Chloe Marshall, 15, and my son, Jack Marshall, 11. They understood the long days of campaigning and the late nights making phone calls and replying to e-mails, never complaining and ever a source of inspiration to me. I stand here in front of you, Mr. Speaker, with a twinge of guilt as a mother who had never missed a dentist appointment, a hockey game, a swimming lesson, a soccer game, a parent-teacher meeting and so on, until I began my political journey. My hope is that in the future Chloe and Jack will look back and say, my mom is one of the reasons why I live in this great Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>I thank Chloe and Jack for their unconditional love they provide, for making me laugh, and for being kind. Mr. Speaker, I also wish to take a moment to thank my friend Andrew Marshall, the father of my children. Without him being the best dad ever, I would not be able to stand here with you all today. I thank him for always knowing that Jack and Chloe come first. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to represent the constituents of Pictou West and I would like to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about Pictou West and the people who call it home. Pictou West is conveniently located in central Nova Scotia, geographically a large constituency that has the Northumberland Strait running along one side, then extending inland through the communities of Caribou, Tony River, Seafoam, River John, West Branch, Alma, Mill Brook, Gairloch, Salt Springs, Union Centre, Middle River, Scotsburn, Abercrombie and, of course the Town of Pictou, the birthplace of New Scotland.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Pictou West is a large rural area comprised of many small communities and villages with the only urban area being the small Town of Pictou. Pictou West is a wonderful place to live and raise a family. It is full of natural beauty with many opportunities to enjoy the outdoors all year long - from swimming in the warmest waters north of the Carolinas to hiking the trails of Fitzpatrick Mountain and then snowmobiling the same trails in the winter, to jog in the Jitney Trail to enjoying the view at the Greenhill Lookoff, and of course enjoying our two provincial parks located in Salt Springs and Caribou. Pictou West is truly a scenic location.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Pictou West offers many opportunities for residents and tourists alike to celebrate the rich diversity of cultures that exist in Pictou West. Events and festivals are happening all year long, from suppers at the many churches, the annual chicken barbeque in Tony River, Highland Homecoming in Pictou, River John Festival Days, lobster dinners, winter carnivals, the famous Scotsburn pork chop barbeque that attracted 1,200 people this past summer and last, but not least, the Pictou Lobster Carnival which was voted the number-one festival in Canada, through the WestJet's Fun 'n Festival Series in 2010 and is set to celebrate its 80<sup>th</sup> year in 2014. The Pictou Lobster Carnival marks the conclusion of a successful lobster season and is celebrated the second weekend every July. Lobster Carnival attracts tourists from far and near and former residents use this event to return home to visit family and friends. I extend a warm invitation to you, Mr. Speaker, and other MLAs to join us in Pictou West for this celebration.</p>
<p>Not only is Pictou West one of the most beautiful regions in our province but there are many museums to enjoy including the Hector Heritage Quay, home of the famed ship <i>Hector</i> that brought the first Scottish settlers to Nova Scotia; the McCulloch House Museum, the Fisheries Museum, the Loch Broom Log Church just to name a few. Mr. Speaker, Pictou West is home to many old and architecturally interesting buildings. There are many century homes, old stone buildings, and the old Pictou Post Office which is noted in <i>Guinness World Records </i>as the only building that has a window in the chimney.</p>
<p>During the summer months, the Town of Pictou offers free entertainment featuring local entertainers on the beautiful Pictou waterfront. Mr. Speaker, Pictou West is home to many talented musicians including Dave Gunning, Fleur Mainville, Karen Corbin, Ashley George, and John Spyder Macdonald. Pictou is home to the deCoste Entertainment Centre which showcases internationally famous acts and national and local talent as well. The annual Pictou Rotary Play is eagerly anticipated and always a sold out show. An amazing opportunity exists to expand on the natural beauty of Pictou West and the many festivals and events to further promote and develop the tourism industry in our area.</p>
<p>Pictou West is the gateway to the province from Prince Edward Island via the Caribou-Wood Islands ferry. The ferry provides an invaluable link between the two provinces and many jobs in my constituency. Mr. Speaker, like many constituencies the economy has been tough the last number of years and job losses have abounded. We are fortunate to have a strong entrepreneurial spirit in Pictou West with many family-owned businesses. Some of these businesses are fairly large such as MacKay Meters, the Scotsburn Lumber mill, King Freight Lines, Gerald Battist Trucking, North Nova Seafoods, and of course the Pictou Advocate Printing &amp; Publishing. Other small businesses include pharmacies, hair salons, restaurants, and gift boutiques. These businesses make up the backbone of Pictou West and rural Nova Scotia. We must do everything we can to make it easier to start, own, and operate a small business in the Province of Nova Scotia. We must eliminate the red tape.</p>
<p>Michelin Tire and Northern Pulp are both located within Pictou West, providing jobs for the entire county and beyond. These businesses provide not only good-paying jobs, but the economic spinoffs and benefits are immeasurable. We must find a way, however, to keep these businesses operating without compromising the health of our residents. Good health is a non-negotiable commodity that we cannot afford to take for granted. (Applause)</p>
<p>With new technologies and modern up-to-date science we must ensure that all businesses comply with the existing environmental laws and we must, Mr. Speaker, look at the environmental laws of Nova Scotia and ensure they are up to par with the rest of Canada and other first-world nations. There needs to be an open dialogue between government, the constituents of Pictou West, and Northern Pulp to ensure the health and safety of our people and community. Madam Speaker, steps must be taken to clean up the mill in Boat Harbour, which is located in Pictou East, once and for all. Pictou West constituents do not support fracking. They are justifiably worried about the long-term effects to our environment. Therefore I am pleased the government has placed a moratorium on fracking.</p>
<p>I would be remiss, Madam Speaker, if I failed to pay homage to many of our farmers and fishermen who call Pictou West home. They are a major and important part of the economy in our area. Our farmers are struggling in today's world and we must do everything we can to support our farmers and encourage Nova Scotians to buy and support local. Nova Scotia lobster is world renowned. Lobster fishermen work hard in unpredictable conditions and they deserve a fair market value for their product. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the communities, businesses, festivals, and events I named are but a few of the reasons Pictou West is such an amazing place to work, live, and raise a family and I apologize if I have missed any.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Madam Speaker, the greatest asset Pictou West has is its people. The people of Pictou West are hard-working, proud and community-minded. The community spirit is evident in the many events that take place year-round. Our people are always willing to step up to help a friend or neighbour in need. Benefits for people in crises are commonplace and a testament to the community spirit that radiates through Pictou West. This is evident in how the entire community recently rallied around the Hawkins family when little Reese Hawkins was ill and I am so happy to say is doing very well. In fact, Reese was recently granted a wish and will be taking a Disney cruise along with her parents and older brother. In turn, Reese's parents, along with friends, have raised funds to help support research for acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when there is a cause, you can bet the people of Pictou West will jump in and give a helping hand. When the Hector Arena in Pictou was close to shutting down due to the need for costly upgrades, once again the community rallied. Fundraising began immediately. Now the roof has been replaced, the ice surface replaced along with the boards, ice plant, et cetera.</p>
<p>The people of Pictou West are truly inspirational. This would be a good time to mention that when the YMCA decided to shut down the Pictou location, the O'Brien family stepped up and reopened the location. Pictou boasts the Hector Arena, the Fisheries pool, and a family-owned and operated gym.</p>
<p>I am disheartened to say, Madam Speaker, that Pictou West is slowly losing its greatest asset - its people. People are leaving in record numbers. Why would anyone want to leave? It is simple - jobs. Jobs are disappearing. Times are getting tough. Small businesses are finding it too difficult to compete and are closing as a result. Approximately eight small businesses have closed in Pictou West in the last year alone. Larger businesses are laying off at an alarming rate. Getting by day to day is becoming more challenging. Everyday needs are becoming more expensive - power bills, fuel bills, insurance, groceries; the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>The government must find a way to make life more affordable and stimulate the economy. We will make the government accountable and hold them to the promises they made during the election. More importantly, we will work with them to put Nova Scotia first. We all know divide and conquer is not the answer to success.</p>
<p>Pictou West has another claim to fame that I must share here today. Madam Speaker, Pictou West has the worst road in Atlantic Canada, not something we are proud of but a designation we cannot deny. We have the worst road in Atlantic Canada. Everyone here is thinking (Interruption) Yes. Well, that must be so bad. It's not just bad, it is fatal. The Cape John Road must be repaired along with many roads in Pictou West and across the whole province. The government needs a plan to deal with the state of the roads across the great province. If we are able to expand on our tourism industry at all, we must provide safe roads not only for our residents but for tourists as well.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Pictou West is made up of many small communities that are each unique. Many of these communities offer churches, community centres, fire departments and schools. Within Pictou West I am proud to say we have seven fire departments. At the heart of many of these communities are the schools located within them. There are eight schools located in Pictou West, three within the Town of Pictou and the rest spread throughout the smaller communities. The small community schools are wonderful places to receive a quality education and foster community-mindedness that translates into not only a well-educated society but also encourages the kind of stewardship I spoke of earlier where people are quick to give a helping hand to those in need.</p>
<p>River John Consolidated has been struggling with the school board to prove its importance to the community of River John and how it benefits the students to stay within their own community for early education. The government must come up with a new system for determining school closures. I hope the government listens compassionately and remembers the future of rural community life becomes threatened when schools are closed. I am happy to hear of the government's plan to reinvest the funding in our education system that had been cut over the past four years. Education is key to our future success.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I question why, if the government is committed to reinvesting our education system as well as committed to expanding the delivery and quality of French language services in Nova Scotia, then why is French Immersion the only program in Pictou West in jeopardy? Not only are we possibly losing the French Immersion program in Pictou West altogether but the school board is refusing to provide transportation to the other side of the county for the Pictou West students who would like to be enrolled in the program. This is an injustice to our students in Pictou West, and I ask that the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development take time to thoroughly investigate this situation.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I am deeply concerned about the state of our health care system in Nova Scotia. Long wait times to see specialists; no available beds, resulting in patients lying for days in hallways; long-term care bed shortages, with the elderly being moved out of their communities. Too many bureaucrats and not enough front-line staff are all problems that currently exist.</p>
<p>The government has promised more money for the front-lines in health care, and we will hold them to it. To my knowledge, we are only one of two provinces that do not help to subsidize hearing aids for seniors. I have a constituent who is unable to replace her hearing aids because she cannot afford the $5,500 price tag. We must do better by our seniors. Nova Scotia should join the majority of other provinces and subsidize the cost of hearing aids.</p>
<p>One area of concern that was not addressed by the government that deeply concerns me is mental health care. Too many people are waiting too long to get the care they require. This is placing unnecessary hardship and strain on not only the individual but on the families, impacting all areas of society, health care, education, and the workplace.</p>
<p>I would like to address the reluctance of so many to participate in the electoral process. I have found that a good portion of voters do not understand the process. They do not understand the difference between municipal, provincial, and federal politics. They do not understand that a vote for a particular Party in provincial politics is not a vote for the same Party federally. The confusion is compounded by the campaigning of federal politicians in provincial politics.</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned about the apparent voter apathy. Voters feel that their voice doesn't count or that politicians are all crooks or that it doesn't matter. The average age of voters is 55 years. My goal was to increase voter turnout in Pictou West while encouraging younger voters to make their voice heard. I am proud to say that my goal was realized. (Applause) Pictou West had the highest voter turnout in the province, with a little over 70 per cent. We now have a chance to prove that we are not crooks, that Nova Scotians come first, and that we can work together to do what is best for all the people of this great province. As I have said so many times to my son before going on the ice to play hockey, the game is about what is on the front of the jersey. The logo, the name on the front of the jersey, is far more important than the solo name on the back of the jersey.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I am thrilled to have our office up and running efficiently under the most dedicated CA an MLA could have. Michelle Livingston, I thank you from my heart to yours for all that you do.</p>
<p>In closing, I do wish to acknowledge my loving father, Frank MacFarlane, who is proudly watching from his home in Three Brooks. He is one of the last known gentlemen I know and love dearly. I have two amazing brothers who I must extend my gratitude to as well: my brother Todd MacFarlane and his family in Maine, and my brother Frank MacFarlane and his family in Kentville, Nova Scotia. They are two of the funniest people I know, with innate jovial spirits. I thank them for their words of wisdom and for always so graciously accepting their loss when playing against me in hockey, scrabble, baseball, soccer, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>We tend to save the best for the last. I wish to thank my late mother, Linda Ann Hadley MacFarlane, who passed away just a year ago. She was my anchor, my consultant, my supporter, and when needed, my harshest critic. She taught me that love is a necessity and not a luxury during these difficult times we are facing.</p>
<p>It seems fitting with that last statement that I encourage you all during this holiday season to extend that extra hand of support, whether it be sponsoring an underprivileged family at Christmas, volunteering at your local food bank or youth centre, or perhaps finding some spare time in your hectic schedules to be with someone you know who is alone and in need of companionship.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we as humans need to do better. Be kind and be well. Thank you.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today on the Liberal Opposition Day to talk about Resolution No. 42. I'm going to read it because there are a number of points in it, just as today during Question Period the minister said there were a number of points, there certainly are in this resolution as well although there is an overriding theme. The resolution reads:</p>
<p>"Therefore be it resolved that the NDP's track record of university prepayments, consistent technique of making spending projections and employee estimates higher than actuals, and failure to disclose a $27 million revenue overstatement highlights their inability to manage the finances of the province and brings into question the veracity of their budgetary reporting."</p>
<p>That is a Liberal resolution that was read here a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>As you can see this is very timely that we discuss this today; this is, as you know, the day before the provincial budget is going to be introduced. We are, of course, looking forward to the details that we're going to see tomorrow, I want to be careful not to disparage any of that in advance, but the real point of it is there are a lot of reasons for us to be skeptical, perhaps to be mistrustful of what is going to come out tomorrow in the budget.</p>
<p>By way of discussion, if you think back to just a few months ago the Finance Minister, herself, was really speaking in very soft tones about whether or not the budget would be balanced, whether it was going to be possible. She, herself, was expressing concerns and some skepticism or doubt and, in fact, suddenly all of that evaporated and the Premier announced it's balanced and it's balanced. Whether you understand how it's done or whether it's a sleight of hand, it's balanced, but I would caution the people on the other side of this House to be a little bit skeptical yourselves, to use your own mind.</p>
<p>In your own ridings schools have been cut, we've just had a debate here on education; $65 million has been taken out of the schools in your riding and a lot of small schools being closed because school board members are in tears about the pressure they are under to save money and to make ends meet. They don't want to close these schools, but they're being forced to because their budgets have been squished and that's happening as a result of some of the cuts and the priorities really of the government across the way, of the NDP Government.</p>
<p>I would hesitate to - you know, when I look at your own priorities, that's the big question here: what are the priorities of the NDP Government? Frankly, the people of Nova Scotia are utterly confused, because for years in Opposition you had high moral standards, in fact &#x2026;</p></speech>
          <speech by="" as="#speaker" status="undefined">
            <from>MADAM SPEAKER</from>
            <p>Order, please. I just want to remind the member that the use of "you" in talking across the floor is not acceptable. Offer your remarks through the Chair.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Thank you. That's a very good comment, Madam Speaker. I think I was just responding to the enthusiasm of the members across the way, so I will definitely speak to the government instead.</p>
<p>As I said, there has been a lot of harm in the communities of Nova Scotia because of cuts to education in particular. We know that the cost of living has risen, and that while the government is boasting about many other accomplishments, the people of Nova Scotia are really feeling it. We're feeling it in so many ways, and electricity is a main one that's harming the growth of our businesses, as well as hurting people in their own homes trying to keep warm. It's hurting seniors and others, and I know tomorrow we'll hear - the government, again, has made a pre-announcement around some moves that will be good for seniors for property tax rebates and so on for people who can't afford the property taxes, but they don't come into effect until after we will have had an election, so they really amount to election promises.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to the state of affairs today, Madam Speaker, and why we're calling into question in this resolution whether or not the NDP Government has the ability to manage the finances of this province. We say that you cannot trust the budgetary reporting that we've seen, and my guess is that we'll see a very rosy budget introduced tomorrow, and probably an election before the first quarter results come in, because when you go to those quarterly updates on the budget and how the actuals are coming down and how the year is unfolding in reality, there is often a disconnect. If we wait until September, when the disconnect becomes clear, it will show then that the numbers that we're going to see tomorrow, and the backslapping and the handshaking and all the self-congratulatory moves - that's going to be shown to be very weak and very empty. I hope you all know that, as you participate in the backslapping and the shaking of hands and the joyousness, because we don't believe you, and Nova Scotians don't believe it either.</p></speech>

            <p>Order, please. Again, I would remind the member to direct comments through the Speaker.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>I should probably just make sure I put all my remarks through yourself, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>I wanted to go over a little bit of history. We have three years of history that might have given me pause and reason to say that the track record is not strong for this government. To begin with, there was the university prepayment that was done early in the government's mandate. What's really interesting about the university prepayment is that initially the Progressive Conservative Government was going to do that. The government of the day had proposed to do that, and the Finance Minister - the NDP's first Finance Minister, the member for Halifax Fairview - had actually condemned that, had said that that was a terrible practice. Then when the budget was prepared for the first year of the NDP mandate, the same practice was engaged in.</p>
<p>We actually had the Finance Minister prepaying universities that year by $341 million, and he put the 2010-11 payments into the year before, 2009-10. By doing that, he had a much, much rosier budget to present, by $341 million.</p>
<p>At the time, in September 2009, The ChronicleHerald editorial was very, very to the point, and very accurate. I'm going to read a few points from that editorial in September 2009, the title of which was "Provincial Deficit: From MOU to MOU-too," which means it was just a repeat of what the Progressive Conservative Government had been trying to do, and what the - as I said, at the time, when they were in Opposition, the NDP had taken great exception to. At one point in this article the editor says, "To see the NDP replaying the MOU pre-payment game is deeply disappointing - a bus-sized hit to the new government's credibility. Opposition leader Stephen McNeil calls it 'political cover' and a 'charade.' Sounds about right."</p></speech>

          <speech by="#08ecdd96-bc51-4f9f-bb87-7a7b5060d8c2"><from>MS. WHALEN</from><p>Thank you. I thought if it was a quote, we were okay. However we were talking about the Opposition Leader, the member for Annapolis, who at that time called it, I'll repeat this, "political cover" and a "charade." The editor said, "Sounds about right." I think that's the most important thing in this article although I may say afterwards - we'll table it again, table it now; I think it has been tabled before.</p>
<p>The MOU prepayment was the start of eroding the confidence that the people of Nova Scotia had in the NDP Government. The NDP Government, in Opposition, had promised to be different, had said they were different, were a first-time government and had begun their term in office by doing the same sort of shenanigans that they had condemned in the past. We've seen it in other ways as well.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister at the time, the member for Halifax Fairview, had soundly condemned the earlier governments for bringing in user fee increases and not explaining or demonstrating how they actually reflected the additional cost to deliver services. A good example was given here the other day in Question Period when the question related to the Minister of Finance, asking how, indeed, it was more expensive now to issue a vehicle renewal permit which we have to do and I believe the cost is now over $200 for a two-year permit. Anyway, the same cost is involved, you return your envelope with the cheque and they send you out a sticker and the question is, how has that gone up 6 per cent in just two years? It hasn't.</p>
<p>There has been no more additional work, it's a simple process and it's just a way to download costs of government to the poor people that have to go in and get all of these different licences and permits. It's putting a lot more emphasis on business; I've had a number of e-mails from people who say it's going to cost more to register businesses - lawyers who are representing firms are saying it's going to be more costly to their clients. There are cost increases for everything from getting your GED, which are people trying to improve themselves, to getting maintenance enforcement records, if you need to get that information as a family member who relies on maintenance enforcement.</p>
<p>It's going to hit everybody, we're talking about 1,400 fees. The point is - I know I have just a minute left - the government of the day today said one thing in Opposition and has done an exactly opposite thing when governing. User fees are an exact example of that. Increasing user fees without providing explanations for where the costs have literally gone up is just another tax grab. That is the word that was used by the NDP in Opposition, it's a tax grab. All we were asking for is greater transparency, greater reliability of what we're hearing and better explanation. They're lacking in all of these areas from the prepayment to universities to user fees and so on. I know we'll hear more in the debate that is to follow. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

LENORE ZANN</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here today standing on my feet in Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I believe it's my second one in four and a half years. I want to begin by saying congratulations to all of the new members from both Parties who have now stood in their places and had the opportunity to address the House. I know it's an exciting opportunity, and you really feel a part of history while you're doing it. I know that many other members still have to get on their feet and do it, and I'm looking forward to hearing what they have to say as well.</p>
<p>It's always nice to see how proud people are of their homes, of the places they come from, and to hear all of the different events that take place in these communities, and also to hear from year to year the different things in the communities that each person is proud of, that is perhaps different from other members in past years. I look forward to hearing more people getting on their feet and talking about this beautiful province that we all call home. After all, I would like to remind all members here that we are all one. Nova Scotia is a very small province - 900,000 people is nothing, really, in the grand scheme of things. The more we can do together and to move our province forward to be full of joy and life and health and prosperity for our people, then I believe we are doing our jobs as members of this House of Assembly.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to say the name for my riding, Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River, while a little bit of a mouthful, used to be Truro-Bible Hill. I just felt that the last time when I was in session, it was an important opportunity as the boundaries were being changed and names were being changed to address the issue that my constituency is actually made up of four distinct communities: Truro, Bible Hill, Millbrook First Nations, and Salmon River. In each of these communities, the people are very proud of their community, of what they do, of the different festivities that take place there, and I felt it was about time to address the fact that two of those communities were not included in the title. Therefore, I was given the opportunity to change it to add those two communities.</p>
<p>I'd like to begin by talking about my Millbrook First Nations community, who helped greatly in the last election. When I went from house to house, people were so quick to say, put up a sign, and we're so glad to see you in our community all of the time, attending powwows and attending funerals, attending important special emergency meetings that have been held - for instance, the Idle No More movement. At one point in time we were talking about what they were going to do to protest the federal government's bills that were basically taking away rights of First Nations people across the country and also taking away environmental protections for our waterways.</p>
<p>At one special emergency meeting that went until about 11:00 p.m. in Millbrook, it was decided that they wanted to talk about closing down Highway No. 102 for a short time to bring attention to this very important issue. They turned to me as their MLA and said, so, what about you? Would you stand with us if we do this? I thought about it for a minute and I said, yes, certainly I will.</p>
<p>In fact, I ended up calling my chief of staff at the time and the then-Premier Darrell Dexter and letting them know that we would be closing down Highway No. 102 down to one lane of traffic. I told them the times it would be taking place and that the RCMP would be helping us with this, so nobody would be hurt. In fact, it turned out to be a very good and successful, peaceful rally and a protest, and many people across the country joined in that protest in their homes and in their communities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn't stop the government in Ottawa from passing the bill, but as Environment Critic for the NDP, I certainly intend to keep any issue that would address the problems of attacking our environment in both Nova Scotia and in Canada, I would like to keep that well in the front line of fire for us to address.</p>
<p>I would also like to say that Salmon River, the home of Hockeyville, is another important community place in my riding. Several years ago they were chosen from right across Canada to be the community to represent the perfect little community for a hockey rink. At Deuville's rink, where many different minor hockey teams play and practise, and many kids have had an opportunity to get their start playing hockey, have taken place in that facility, which is a family-owned and run business. They built it about 25 years ago and it is a father and son team. The father is now in his 90s. I had the opportunity a few years ago to sing <i>Happy Birthday</i> to him, as Marilyn Munroe, sitting in his lap, which they say he will never forget and has kept him living several years longer than perhaps he would have.</p>
<p>Salmon River also is a lovely community. They have a fire department there that has wonderful dinners and suppers. They celebrated their 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary last year and had a parade, which I was pleased to take part in.</p>
<p>We also have Truro itself which, of course, is an old town in Nova Scotia. We have the first United Church in Nova Scotia and many of the Loyalists came and there are graves still to this day where you can locate some of the first Loyalists who came across from the New England States, and of course, also a wonderful Black community. Some came across as slaves and were given free land and some - even when you look into the history here - there were some members of the communities in Nova Scotia who still had slaves in Nova Scotia, even though many people think that Nova Scotia never had slaves. In fact, they did and there are some graves there, there is a gravesite. Unfortunately many of them are unmarked, due to racism and discrimination of the day. We know some of them who were buried there, and I am hoping that a plaque will be placed commemorating the Black Loyalists and other people who came over to Nova Scotia and settled there.</p>
<p>I am very proud of my African Nova Scotian community. Dr. Burnley "Rocky" Jones, of course, is a leading member of that community and I was very sad to see him go this year. He was a dear friend of mine. He was an executive on my NDP riding association. He was my buddy; he was one of my mentors, along with Alexa McDonough so I was very, very sad that his health began to deteriorate. We had many great times, lots of laughs and joy knocking on doors in the last election in 2009 and to see strapping Mr. Rocky Jones and tiny little me with my blonde hair going from door to door and being invited into people's homes. People would suddenly start to party; a party would erupt as soon as we arrived. It was pretty amazing.</p>
<p>I look to him oftentimes and when I am in doubt about what to do or what to say about a particular issue, many times I think of Rocky and say, what would Rocky say about this? What would Rocky do here? I actually use that as my guide for some of my decisions. He didn't always agree with some of the things that the NDP Government did but he was always a strong supporter of the NDP, in spite of some differences that he had. He and I shared some of those differences, as well, and he will be missed.</p>
<p>The other person, too - there are many wonderful people in that community but actually Rocky's mom was a wonderful woman, Mrs. Jones, who taught at the Truro Junior High School, along with my mother. She went back to school at the age of 60 or 62 and got her teaching degree and started the first class on discrimination and race issues and African Nova Scotian history, along with my mother. The two of them really made a dent in some of the racist attitudes that were prevailing way back in the times when these kinds of classes were not part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>My mother also liked to teach about First Nations history and, in fact, I'm told by several of the band members, the councillors today, that they remember coming from St. Mary's School, which was a Catholic school run by nuns, and they came into Grade 7 and my mother was their homeroom teacher; they had Mrs. Jones as well. My mother taught history and they would say that they started off and they didn't know if they would be able to last for the year or two that they would be in junior high school because of former discriminatory remarks and activities by some of the teachers in their last school.</p>
<p>So these kids saw this little blond spitfire of a woman with this Australian accent come in and she said well now, class, I have these two books that I'm supposed to teach you history from, but I'm going to show you where these two books belong - and she threw them in the garbage can. She said I believe these books are full of racist and discriminatory stories about our First Nations people and our African Nova Scotian communities and I refuse to teach from them.</p>
<p>So she went to the archives and she found out the actual facts about the wonderful things that our First Nations and our Black community had done, like helping to build the Citadel for instance, and things like this which were not included in the history books at the time, and she proceeded to teach from those as well as books that had been written by people who belonged to those communities who knew the history. So in this way, Mrs. Jones and my mother had, I believe, a great deal of weight in the Truro Junior High School and how things started to unroll from there.</p>
<p>The other part of my riding is Bible Hill, which a lot of people wonder why it's called Bible Hill. I wondered that myself, and the story is that, of course, my area was an Acadian-settled area originally. That's where the dykes came from that hold out the seas and hold out the Salmon River and the Bay of Fundy. These dykes have been there for 400 years and in the area that is now called Bible Hill, obviously there's a hill there and after the British got rid of our wonderful Acadian people and sent them all over the world in ships, separating parents, children, mothers, daughters - it was a very, very sad occasion - well, when the British came up to Bible Hill, they found a bible in French that some French settler had left there.</p>
<p>Now, I'm also told that some of the Acadians from that area managed to escape and didn't get on the ships. They were friends with the First Nations, with the Mi'kmaq, and they were taken up into the hills and to other places. They walked miles; some of them died on the roads trying to get away, but many of them also survived. So we have many families now in Truro that actually date right back to the earliest settlers, and some of them are four generations and five generations of Acadian, which many people don't really realize when they hear Truro or Bible Hill. You wouldn't think it has an Acadian background, but it actually does.</p>
<p>Bible Hill has firefighters there, as well, and they have wonderful, wonderful dinners and suppers, and awards nights which I really enjoy attending. I go skating in Bible Hill; I go for walks in Bible Hill - we have wonderful paths there. Of course, we have the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus now. Our NDP Government, in the last term, decided to make Truro and Bible Hill the centre for agriculture. We do incredible research there at the campus, including one researcher there has discovered a way of making needles on fir trees and pine trees stay longer on the Christmas trees so they can be shipped for long destinations across the seas.</p>
<p>Also, they've discovered that the property of sunflowers whereby sunflower seeds have a natural ingredient that is an insect repellent and they have partnered up with a company in Scotland to look into creating a value-added product for our farmers, so that if our farmers can grow more sunflowers and ship the seeds to Scotland they will create these all-natural hangers that you can hang in your kitchen that will dispel insects like fruit flies and things like that. The farmers would get a percentage of each of these products that would be sold, which is a fantastic way for our farmers to make extra value-added money.</p>
<p>Speaking of farming, there is a lot of interest in our agriculture industry in Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River, so I was very pleased that our last government was able to add in a bunch of different programs to help our farming industry. For instance, one of them was Homegrown Success. We put $3.7 million into that. It was a federal-provincial program, 60-40, and I would love to see the province put more money into that now. I'm hoping that the Agriculture Minister will take a look at that and see if perhaps the province could put 100 per cent into that program. I know we were working toward that. That particular program was so successful - it was open for two weeks for farmers to apply, but there was so much uptake on it that farmers actually filled the roster in four days, and that was a $3.7 million investment.</p>
<p>It's nice to see that Nova Scotia is the only province in Canada that has had an increase in farms. We have 3,900 farms in Nova Scotia now, and 236 of those farms are new ones. Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger, but there are 236 new farms, which is fantastic. As Agriculture Critic for the NDP, I'm very, very pleased to see that all of this great work is being done, and I would imagine that the Liberal Government will be continuing to try to help this keep growing.</p>
<p>Another one of our programs that the NDP put in place was THINKFARM. There was also the Limestone Program, which basically was a tile-drainage program for helping to drain the fields properly. We had promised to put the $400,000 that was already in it up to $600,000 just before the election, about six months before the election, so I'm hoping that will be something the minister will take a look at.</p>
<p>Also, Farm Next - we had suggested there should be another $100,000 put into that. It was very, very successful. It's about farm succession, as there are many farmers who, of course, are growing older. They need to be able to give their farm to the next generation, either their own children, daughters, sons, or someone else. We originally had invested up to $30,000, but it would be very nice to see an additional $100,000 added, which we did announce prior to the last election.</p>
<p>We would like to see the grass-fed beef program continue. It has turned a corner, and our beef market is doing much better than it was before. Unfortunately, our hog market was decimated, but the beef industry prices have recovered, and that is really great to see. I do know as well that the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture will be hoping to get an investment from this current government. A tax credit investment would be very much appreciated by Nova Scotia's farmer. I hope that the government and the minister will take a look at that; that's something I would like to follow up with. I know that a majority of the beef market in Nova Scotia - 8 per cent to 10 per cent of it - goes to Nova Scotia, and the rest goes around the Maritime Provinces. We will probably never have a global beef market, but if we can keep up our market going to the Atlantic Provinces, as we're doing, that would be fantastic.</p>
<p>We also have genomics people at Dalhousie University who are looking at ways of creating more profit for our cows, for our milk, and things like this. We have a new person who has just been hired for five years there, Yuri Montanholi, who's from Brazil - a researcher who specializes in genomics. It will be interesting to watch the results of his research as well.</p>
<p>The other thing I wanted to talk about when it comes to agriculture is the fact that we have a freeze-drying centre in old barns, and that does about $1.5 million worth of work. We have a $140 million processing plant on Highway No. 340; processing is a very important part for farmers as well. They would like to get into processing more, rather than sending it out of the province to then be sent back. That's something that I think we need to look at.</p>
<p>Inspection of our different sections is important as well. I know we have a federal inspection agency but we believe that the province will need to be able to keep an eye on a good inspection process as well.</p>
<p>Also our wild blueberries are an amazing thing that Nova Scotia has going for it. We have 48 million pounds of wild blueberries that go to market. Artisanal cheeses, as well, are very important to us. I'm truly hoping that the new trade agreements with China and Europe don't get in the way of our exports, don't get in the way of imports coming into Nova Scotia that will hurt our own local markets. I do know that our provincial government, the NDP, was very supportive of locally grown food going to local people and for most Nova Scotians to start eating local is a very important thing for our government. I would imagine that the Liberal Government will continue to push for that.</p>
<p>In closing, I would just like to say that Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River is a beautiful community with many growing aspects to it. We are one of the fastest growing communities in Nova Scotia, second only to Wolfville. I highly recommend that you come through, that you come into town and that you do some shopping along Inglis Place and along all the streets in downtown Truro. We have many new restaurants there. We have great dress shops and even though Margolians is a loss and we miss it terribly, there are other wonderful shops that have sprung up in its place and business is actually booming. So come on down and visit us in Truro-Bible Hill-Millbrook-Salmon River, come to a pow-wow and you'll be very welcome. Thank you.</p></speech>
          <speech by="#22119b83-0505-4c62-95ff-e8c0e378764c"><from>MR. JIM MORTON</from><p>Before I begin my remarks, it might not have been so apparent as the member for Halifax Clayton Park was speaking earlier, I do want to remind members of this House that tomorrow the Minister of Finance will present a balanced budget. (Applause)</p>
<p>On April 4<sup>th</sup>, Nova Scotia will join only three other provinces with a balanced budget and will be the only province in Atlantic Canada with a balanced budget. We've already seen the predictable efforts to undermine this budget and the Opposition is downplaying the hard work that we've done. When we reined in spending, the Opposition called them cuts. When we invested in areas important to Nova Scotians, the Opposition called us irresponsible.</p>
<p>Regardless of the political rhetoric, everyone knows that getting Nova Scotia back to balance hasn't been an easy task. As the members of this House well know, we inherited a considerable financial challenge, the global economic slowdown was underway, and no one could have predicted that it would have lasted as long as it has.</p>
<p>We didn't slash like other governments, we all know that that kind of approach had very negative impacts in the past. This government made strategic, well-thought-out decisions that had the best interests of Nova Scotians at heart.</p>
<p>When we took office we engaged expert help to tackle what was in front of us. We asked for advice from the best minds in our region, from Elizabeth Beale, from Tim O'Neil, from Lars Osberg, and from Donald Savoie. Do you know what they told us, Madam Speaker? They told us that if we didn't turn the ship around, Nova Scotia was on track for a $1.4 billion deficit.</p>
<p>That number is unimaginable, but the fact is - and this is an important fact, Madam Speaker - it never came to pass. Today, unlike most provinces in Canada, Nova Scotia is ready to balance its budget.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I want to point out that everyone in Nova Scotia has shared in the effort and the responsibility of getting Nova Scotia back to balance. As I think everyone in this House knows, thousands of Nova Scotians had a say in our plan when they participated in the most extensive pre-budget consultation in this province's history - many of us were at parts of those consultations.</p>
<p>Based on what we heard from the experts and from everyday citizens, we put together a three-pronged plan. That plan involved increasing revenue, reducing government spending, and growing the economy. As we'll see tomorrow, our plan was successful. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, we temporarily raised the HST by two points, and we helped to provide revenue at a time when the economic picture was uncertain. This revenue helped protect important government programs Nova Scotians rely on. Of course we introduced offsetting tax rebates aimed at low-income Nova Scotians - the Affordable Living Tax Credit and the Poverty Reduction Tax Credit have helped make life more affordable for tens of thousands of Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Now, as we embark on a balanced budget, we also look forward to a reduction of the HST. These reductions are built into our fiscal plan and we're on track. In 2014 and then again in 2015, when we can responsibly reduce the HST, that's what we'll do. Just as all Nova Scotians shared in getting our province back to balance, everyone will share in the benefits of the hard work.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the honourable member who prepared the MOU mentioned in the resolution the MOU and municipalities, but as the honourable member well knows, and as everyone in this House knows, the MOU between the province and the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities was based on the understanding that the province's ability to put in place cost-savings for municipalities was subject to government funding. Due to unforeseen costs and revenue losses, the province simply couldn't afford any additional costs and, as a result, government revised the MOU to minimize its financial impact on municipalities. The MOU had been in effect at the time for three years and it is estimated that the total savings to municipalities was about $23 million.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Nova Scotia has for quite some time tied fee increases to the consumer price index. No one likes the price of something to go up, but the fact is that the cost of delivering services does increase. User fees ensure that those who use a particular service pay the cost associated with it, but if someone doesn't own a car they don't bear the cost of inspections, they don't bear the cost of registrations or the cost of licensing.</p>
<p>Fees are not unique to Nova Scotia, nor are gradual increases. But I think, Madam Speaker, when it comes to fee increases the Opposition is conveniently forgetting its own history. I have in front of me a set of media summaries which read - these are from 1994 - Big Trouble: Nova Scotia Forgetting Classrooms; School System on the Verge of Chaos. So there were things that were happening in the 1990s when the Liberals were in power.</p>
<p>When the Progressive Conservatives were booted out of office in 1993, they left behind a deficit of $671 million, Madam Speaker. In 2002, the Hamm Government increased fees to the tune of $26.7 million. Ambulance fees went from $100 to $600, and a new, expensive Pharmacare fee structure was put in place.</p>
<p>This has already been mentioned this afternoon, Madam Speaker, but the Liberals, during that time period decided to charge user fees on Pap tests, and if you can believe it, on prostate exams. It was the Liberals who also did give us user fees that they call tolls on Highway No. 104, and they also gave us P3 schools that we will continue to pay for.</p>
<p>As we heard as well, Madam Speaker, this afternoon, the Liberals managed budget problems - and I think this is a telling bit of information - by cancelling dental care services for children. In 1996, seniors actually begged the Liberal Government of the day not to apply what was then being thought of as BST, which later became HST, to heating fuel and electricity.</p>
<p>So that's some of the history that people may have forgotten in this House, Madam Speaker. But this government has taken steps to protect its most vulnerable citizens. We put in place programs that waive ambulance fees for low-income families and seniors, and we also kept fees associated with public housing flat. Such measures are a testament to the values and commitments of this government. I'm proud that our government has been mindful of Nova Scotians who struggle to make ends meet. And we've introduced measures that help those who need it the most. I've mentioned the Poverty Reduction and Affordable Living Tax Credits, and we're able to do that by using some intelligent taxation. And we've been able to use that kind of taxation to relieve those seniors who pay the Guaranteed Income Supplement from paying provincial income tax.</p>
<p>On this side of the House, Madam Speaker, we are working hard to improve the quality of public services, and to find a more effective and efficient way to deliver them. As the Public Accounts Committee heard just last week, Nova Scotia has some of the most transparent budgeting and reporting processes in Canada. Nova Scotia is the only province that requires the Auditor General to review revenue estimates. Last year, for example, the Auditor General agreed with the reasonableness of our revenue estimates, as did more than a dozen leading economic and financial experts.</p>
<p>The same processes that put together a budget that were used under the previous government, are still in use today, Madam Speaker. The Opposition knows this. So I have to wonder why a decision based on professional judgment and expert advice has been used by the Opposition as an opportunity to undermine the public's trust in their government.</p>
<p>But like I said, our processes are transparent. Budget and Public Accounts updates, as everyone in this House knows, are given regularly in September and December. Financial information is right there in black and white for the public, for the media, and for the Opposition to scrutinize. Madam Speaker, the financial successes of this government are many. We've worked hard to get Nova Scotia back on a sound financial footing, and I would put forward that the proof is there, for everyone who would like to look at it, to see. We've reined in spending, and departmental spending has come in under budget for three years in a row, and is back on track for a fourth year of having the same thing happen. This is an unprecedented level of restraint and responsibility.</p>
<p>We've limited debt growth at a time when other provinces are seeing rapid increases. We've found savings through smarter purchasing, and better prices for contracts and services. We've set budget targets for departments and we've stuck to them, and we've asked the departments to reduce the cost of their administration. I could go on, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>We've promised to bring sanity back to the province's finances, and we've done just that. Our hard work has paid off. We're supporting job creation, and we've reduced the small business tax to its lowest level in 20 years. Average employment in 2012 was the highest level ever, but we won't rest on our laurels. We'll continue to work harder, and we'll continue to work smarter and more collaboratively for all Nova Scotians. We'll invest in a stronger economy, and we look forward to a brighter future.</p>
<p>If I can say this once more, Madam Speaker, we'll introduce a balanced budget tomorrow, on track and as promised. With that, I will take my seat. Thank you very much.</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from><p>I'm pleased to rise and speak on the resolution. It has been very interesting to hear the Liberals and the NDP lecturing anyone, quite frankly, about how to manage the finances of the province. This from a government that just last year presented a budget to the people of Nova Scotia with a $27 million hole in it. This from a government that just two years ago presented a budget here in this House which had zero dollars in it for health equipment - clearly a nonsensical budget that they presented to the people of Nova Scotia with a straight face, only to have to raid the emergency fund for Health and Wellness when it turned out that, of course, somewhere in the province during the year we're going to need some new or upgraded health equipment. This from a government that has been in deficit for four years in a row and managed to run a surplus for one exact day before they plunged the province right back into deficit again. That is why, on the eve of tomorrow's budget, so many Nova Scotians are skeptical about what the NDP say now.</p>
<p>But just to be fair to all sides, it is awfully interesting to watch, of all Parties, the Liberals preach to the NDP about financial management when their own record is so sorry, not just in the past, but in the present. The Liberals are criticizing the NDP for not counting $27 million in revenue overstatement. It was the Liberal Party itself, the last time that they were in, that actually took $600 million - 20 times what the NDP have done - and didn't count it when they tried to tell the people of Nova Scotia that they had a balanced budget. They didn't count $600 million. That's a sorry record. It makes it awfully hard to watch the Liberals lecture the NDP today on being truthful about balanced budgets.</p>
<p>Now, I know some will say, well, that was a while ago, but that is the exact last example we have of the Liberals being in, not counting a $600 million debt. That is the record that they neglected to mention in the resolution here today.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when it comes to Liberals and deficits, we don't even have to look just to when they were in government and how they tried to pull the wool over Nova Scotians' eyes then. Just this year, at their own Party's convention, they reported to their own Party members that in a non-election year, when we're all supposed to be out fundraising and saving money up for an election, they couldn't even balance their own Party's books in such an easy year as the past year was - a $93,000 deficit. Nova Scotians will rightly ask, if you can't manage your own Party, how can we ever trust you to manage the finances of the Province of Nova Scotia? That is the lesson of the Liberal Party annual meeting.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know whether the NDP manage their own Party differently than they manage the government. I don't know if they have a surplus in their own Party or not, because just like with the government when they didn't count $27 million, who knows what they don't count when they report their own Party's finances? I hope that they are better at managing their own Party, first of all, than they are at managing the Government of Nova Scotia accounts. But I also hope for their own sake that they're better at managing their own Party than the Liberals are better at managing their Party, because if they cannot manage to balance their own books, not even in a year where there is no election expense, then how can Nova Scotians ever count on them to manage something much bigger and more complicated, like the whole government? That is not ancient history, Madam Speaker, that is present day, that is the present leadership of the Liberal Party that can't manage the books of one small, little Party, trying to lecture the NDP or anyone else on how to run a government.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, what's even more interesting is that like all three Parties, the Liberals are entrusted with some taxpayer money to run a caucus office. They run a caucus office on the NDP side, we run a caucus office within budget, in fact below budget on the PC side, and the Liberals have a tiny, little budget to try and get right in their tiny, little - less than 20 people - caucus office.</p>
<p>But does the current leadership of the Liberal Party even know how to do that, Madam Speaker? The very people who are trying to tell all Nova Scotians they can run the entire government? No, they can't because do you know what they had to do, Madam Speaker? They had to go outside and hire a consultant, a fancy-pants consultant to help them run an office of less than 20 people. Now how can we trust them to &#x2026;</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#eb42d545-c815-47c5-a60b-237f29603d3e"><from>MS. PATRICIA ARAB</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is an honour to be standing here today among such an inspiring group of colleagues representing all Parties. I would like to begin my remarks by congratulating our Premier and all honourable members for their dedication throughout the campaign. The time and commitment required to run an election, win or lose, is really something that should be commended.</p>
<p>I would like to particularly acknowledge those candidates who ran in Fairview-Clayton Park: NDP candidate Abad Khan, Progressive Conservative candidate Travis Price, Green Party candidate Raland Kinley and Independent candidate Katie Campbell. Ours was a clean campaign and it was truly a pleasure to address the needs of our riding alongside such caring and compassionate candidates.</p>
<p>My interest in politics came at the age of 12 when my father's good friend and former Speaker of the House, Gerry Fogarty, ran as an MLA in the riding then known as Halifax-Bedford Basin. My father had volunteered to help on Mr. Fogarty's campaign and volunteered me along with him. From that successful campaign I was hooked. My love for politics allowed me to work on numerous campaigns and brought me to this very House 16 years ago when I started my job as a messenger, standing up in these very galleries, running audio tapes back and forth to Hansard for transcription, even working there for one summer - Hi, Bob - delivering packages to the various ministries, annoying Peter and Mike and where I had the opportunity to meet and work with people who became some of my closest friends; specifically my dear friend, the infamous David Sheppard.</p>
<p>I actually worked here for many years, Madam Speaker, and only left when I started my career as a teacher. It was during our swearing-in ceremony last month that I realized that things had come full circle. After leaving my teaching and counselling career, I was coming back to my home here at the House of Assembly and yes, I will probably still get a coffee for any of you who ask.</p>
<p>I would be remiss, Madam Speaker, if I did not mention those who helped me get to where I stand today. Firstly to the residents of Fairview-Clayton Park who believed in me and in our Liberal team and decided to put their X by my name. In fact, I would like to thank all the residents of my riding who exercised their right to vote in this election, regardless of who they voted for. We unfortunately exist in a world where the ability to vote freely and democratically is not always allowed, where women are not only unable to run for public office but are not able to vote at all. We are truly blessed to live in a country that allows such freedoms and better yet, allows us to sometimes take them for granted.</p>
<p>I must thank my outstanding campaign team, many of whom have worked with me in the backrooms on various campaigns throughout the years, others who have never been nor have ever had the desire to be political but worked tirelessly in support of me, and all of whom I am so extremely lucky to call my friends. I had over 100 volunteers on my campaign. I would like to say a special thank you to the core group who spent the last year by my side - Marlisa Ghosn, Lisa Courtney, Michael Mercer, David Arab, James Ramia, Justin Ghosn, Elias Metlej, Ryan Spence, Tara Gault, Maurice Fares and last but not least my friend Steve Hiscock. Steve and I have worked on countless campaigns over the years and I am so proud to have been able to be the one to finally give him the much-deserved win.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the numerous young people ranging from age 10 to 22 who gave up their summer vacations and weekends to help me. I'd like to thank in particular Alla Al-arabi, Dylan Brown-St. Hilaire, Alex Ghosn, William Salah, Elias Salah, Simon Salah, Jana Ramia, John Ramia, Eliane Francis, Madeleine Anjoul, Franco Fitzgerald, Alex Blades, John Arab, my canvassing champion Seth Pickard Tattrie and the future Prime Minister of Canada and current Grade 10 rep at Halifax West, the exceptional Ray Anjoul.</p>
<p>I'd also like to give a special thank you to my cousin and official agent, Diana Metlege. Diana, the proud mother of four young children and owner of a successful law firm took on the daunting and demanding role of official agent with the same ease and diligence she has exhibited our entire lives. Diana has been by my side through the best and worst times of my life and I will always be forever grateful to her.</p>
<p>Like all of us here in the House today and like so many who came before us, our families play the biggest role in helping us achieve our accomplishments. I am blessed to have not only a large extended family, some of whom I have already mentioned, but an entire community - the phenomenal Lebanese community of this great province - that worked tirelessly in support of my candidacy.</p>
<p>My extended family - and there really are a lot of us - have always supported me. Being qualified to do something is only part of the process. In order to accomplish things in life, you have to be willing to take risks. Let me tell you, risk taking is much easier when you know that no matter how high or how far you jump, there will always be a group of people ready and waiting to catch your fall.</p>
<p>Not only did I have loving parents and siblings, I had aunts and uncles both here and in Lebanon who helped raise me, who taught me right from wrong and who encouraged me to always reach for the sky. As the youngest of 31 nieces and nephews, I had an instant entourage of friends and supporters who continued that support in full force when I told them of my intentions to run for public office, even the four card-carrying NDP members.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a special thank you to my cousins Wadih and Cathy Fares, both of whom have mentored me in the art of life and the pursuit of my goals no matter the obstacle. Also my sister Paula who spent the majority of her vacation home this summer helping me on the pre-election campaign trail and whose love and support radiated across the country and into my heart throughout the entire campaign. Although she was not physically here, her presence and faith in me was felt every day.</p>
<p>My brother Peter and sister-in-law Leona, who kept me grounded throughout this whole process and continue to do so as I begin this journey. Always making sure that my feet were firmly planted in truth, integrity and good common sense. There are three children - my niece Rachel and my nephews Phillip and Peter. These three remarkable children mean more to me than I could ever express in words. They are each unique and exceptional in so many ways and help to bring light into my life and a laugh in my heart no matter the challenge I face.</p>
<p>My sister Marianne, who not only successfully took on the oft-dreaded role of fundraising chair on the campaign team but did everything and anything asked of her and stood by me through this whole process, my whole life really, as my biggest fan and best friend.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I would like to thank my parents, Phillip and Patricia Arab, both strong community activists who taught me from a young age that it was my duty to give back to our community and to advocate for those who needed help. They were, in fact, the ones who started me on this path and even though neither were able to be with me, both of them having passed away last year, I know that they were rooting for me, possibly pulling strings, and championing me on from the best seats in the House.</p>
<p>My parents were truly remarkable, helping anyone in need, from new immigrants, to our neighbours, to those in our church community, and everyone in between. There was never a time when I heard my parents turn someone away who needed help. Even in the last few years of their lives when illness had limited them, it was never able to limit their desire to help. I know that my parents would be proud of me today and proud specifically of the riding that I am so lucky to represent.</p>
<p>Fairview-Clayton Park embraces the true essence of what my parents were all about, Madam Speaker. It is a riding rich in diversity and steeped in history. Politically speaking it is brand new, comprised of the four ridings of Halifax Chebucto, Halifax Fairview, and Halifax Clayton Park. I am honoured to carry on in the footsteps of Howard Epstein, Honourable Graham Steele, and my mentor and friend, the honourable Minister of Finance. I know that I have big shoes to fill and hope to do my constituents and my predecessors proud.</p>
<p>The area we now call Fairview was known as the Dutch Village and was one of the original homes of the foreign Protestants who arrived in Halifax in the 1750s. First known as the Westerwald, or western forest, it was called the Dutch Village by non-German locals. In fact, some of the passengers of the foreign Protestant ships were settled temporarily in the Dutch Village while they waited for a more permanent settlement in Lunenburg County, another part of our beautiful province near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>Clayton Park, although geographically next door, has a much younger history and is named after a family that owned property in the area. The Clayton Park development began on July 12, 1962. My mother would often tell the story of when her father bought the property that my house was built on. My grandparents, proud residents of Agricola Street in the city's North End, bought land nearby Mount Saint Vincent University in 1959, much to the chagrin of their families and neighbours who couldn't understand why they would ever want to live so far away from the city.</p>
<p>The riding has the highest number of new immigrants and refugees in our province. It will be a pleasure to be able to help these constituents feel welcome to this province and city in the same manner that my father and ancestors were.</p>
<p>Fairview-Clayton Park is home to Halifax's first suburban shopping centre, the Bayers Road Shopping Centre, and was home to one of Halifax's first suburban high schools, the original Halifax West, which was open from 1958 to 2000 and was my alma mater. Fairview-Clayton Park is also home to a number of notable Nova Scotians, including Joel Plaskett and the members of his band, Thrush Hermit, as well as Chris Murphy and the members of the band Sloan.</p>
<p>Not only is it rich in history, Madam Speaker, my riding is also an up-and-coming community here in Halifax. We are on the verge of very exciting things and I am so proud to be able to be part of this evolution. I'm proud to be able to work with our city councillors and with our federal counterparts to make sure that the residents of our community are well represented on all levels of government.</p>
<p>I'm also proud to be part of this Liberal team. Each and every one of the MLAs sitting here next to me are hard-working, kind-hearted, and dedicated to their ridings. It is an amazing privilege to be part of such a cohesive team and to know that we all have our province's best interests at heart. I passed on numerous opportunities to leave Nova Scotia because I've always believed in our province and have always wanted to make my home here.</p>
<p>As a teacher and a counsellor I've had the privilege of working in inner-city schools, as well as some of the best rural schools in our province. I have spent the last seven years working on the beautiful South Shore, the last five years in Chester Grant at Forest Heights Community School in the riding of Chester-St. Margaret's. I would like to thank the students and staff at Forest Heights, as well as the members of the Chester, Hubbards, Mill Cove, Tancook, and New Ross communities for their unofficial support of me, and I hope they know that they now have two representatives in this House.</p>
<p>Being a teacher, I understand first-hand the issues facing all of those involved in the education system in our province. Our education system is not reaching its full potential. We must assess the quality of the curriculum that is being delivered and divert resources for our students. It is time that we view our children as our most important resource, our most important investment.</p>
<p>I've also been a certified Canadian counsellor for the past seven years and have worked as an advocate for preventive mental health in our province. As I spoke to the residents of Fairview-Clayton Park, I heard first-hand their concerns surrounding the mental health issues facing so many. We have existed for far too long in a reactionary society - we wait for a crisis to occur and then bring in supports. We throw around mental health terms in our day-to-day lives without understanding the true meaning and overuse these words to the point of ineffectiveness. We need to look at our mental health in the same way that we are encouraged to look at our physical health, and we need break down the taboos surrounding mental health issues and free ourselves from the shame attached to them. This has been something that I have championed for in my professional and personal life, and something that I will continue to do in my new role as MLA. (Applause)</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, our new government knows that there are challenges ahead related to our economy, our population, and rising health care costs. That is why I am proud that we will be investing in education, making smart investments in our economy, and focusing on patient-centred care within our health care system. I'm looking forward to helping build a better Nova Scotia and being a strong voice in this House for the constituents of Fairview-Clayton Park, and I thank you. (Applause)</p></speech>

            <p>Madam Speaker, I'm rising on a point of order that the member opposite is not speaking to the resolution at all and, in fact, is way off topic and there's very little time for us to get to the nub of this resolution. I'm wondering if the member who is speaking has the information so that he could speak to the veracity of the NDP's budgetary techniques.</p>

            <p>The honourable Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#4caa514a-7759-421a-8574-ba7d1932db92"><from>MR. BAILLIE</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker. I do believe that if we are going to have a Party in this House that attacks the veracity of the accounting and financial ability of another Party, that their own sorry record is very relevant to that resolution.</p>
<p>The truth may hurt, Madam Speaker, but it is still the truth. Who else needs a consultant to run such a small, little office. When you talk about veracity, we might as well admit that after that consultant helped them run their tiny, little budget, that that consultant is now running for the Liberal Party. That's pretty cozy. Maybe it's because they know that if they're ever entrusted with any more money or any more management responsibility, they're going to need an awful lot of consultants because they can't get it done themselves. That's why that consultant is running for the Liberal Party today.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I do want to speak directly to the resolution because it talks about the need for veracity in record-keeping, for veracity in financial management, coming from a Party that still hasn't told Nova Scotians exactly where all that trust fund money went, that still hasn't told Nova Scotians whose hands it's in now, whose hands is that money in now, a Party that ran fancy TV ads with no ability to manage their own Party, running a deficit at the same time but a mysterious pot of money over here that they needed to dip into and they had a choice.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about veracity, they had a choice about whether to dip into that cookie jar or not, before the lid was closed. Instead of saying, no, that's wrong, we won't do it - which I actually believe the member for Halifax Clayton Park would have said no to that, knowing her well enough, she would have said no - but the leadership of the Liberal Party dipped into the cookie jar anyway and we're still all waiting for a report, an honest, veracity-based report that shows where that money went, Madam Speaker. Until that day comes, until the Liberal Party can run their own affairs in surplus, they should not be lecturing others. Until they come clean about that trust fund money, they should not be lecturing others, until they can manage a 20-person office without fancy consultants, they should not be lecturing others.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, that is the record of the sponsors of this resolution, and tomorrow, before the NDP get all excited, they are not off the hook because tomorrow Nova Scotians will get to judge for themselves the veracity of the spin coming from the NDP side of the House, the veracity of a government that raised their taxes to the highest in the country, that raised their user fees beyond their ability to pay, that has more money coming in today than any government in the history of the province and they still can't honestly, decently balance the budget.</p>
<p>They cannot hold a candle to the Liberal Party, but they can't hold up a truly balanced budget to the people of Nova Scotia either, and that is a record that they will have to defend when the time comes, because when it comes to running deficits and trying to paper over their own weaknesses, there is no difference between the NDP and the Liberals. They are both the same and Nova Scotians deserve a lot better than either the NDP or the Liberals. They are crying out for a budget that not only looks balanced on paper, they are crying out for a budget that actually, truly, really is balanced.</p>
<p>No one deserves to see a stop in the sea of red ink that has come from the Liberals, even though they're managing a tiny little office, and comes from the NDP, who truly were entrusted with the Government of Nova Scotia, no one deserves to see a truly balanced budget more than the next generation of Nova Scotians, the ones who have to pay the bills, the ones who are looking up to their elected officials watching the flim-flammery that goes around between the Liberals and the NDP here, watching all the spin, measuring them on their ability to manage whatever small amount or large amount that has been entrusted to them, and hoping that some day the people who are entrusted with the public purse stop the games, stop the hiding of things and truly, honestly balance the budget, and stop passing the bills on to the next generation and get on with the job of creating a modern, dynamic, growing economy with all of the jobs and opportunities that could come with it, if we could just get past the record of the Liberals and the NDP.</p>
<p>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          </speech>
          <speech by="#8834559e-ddf7-4ac7-9b30-8ada0eb9a7ca"><from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from><p>Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand and partake in this debate. I hope the Leader of the Third Party stays because I'm going to have some things I would like to say, and I'd like for him to stick around and listen to it.</p>
<p>I think at the heart of this resolution is a question around credibility and integrity - I think that's what's at the heart of this. It has been clear by looking at the government record that Nova Scotians are starting to question their credibility and integrity when it comes to honesty and presenting the facts. It was interesting to listen to the Leader of the Third Party ramble on and focus his guns during the conversation about a resolution about the NDP Government toward the Liberal Party - that's curious indeed. I think it exposes the difference between this caucus and the Progressive Conservative caucus, because while the Third Party is shooting for second place to replace the Opposition, this Party is shooting to replace that government.</p>
<p>What we have seen over the course of the last year is that Nova Scotians are actually looking toward this Party as an alternative - and there is a reason for that. One of them is because of the NDP's dismal record when it comes to keeping its promises, when it comes to its integrity and when it comes to its credibility with the public, but also because the Leader of the Third Party does not present a progressive vision of the province to Nova Scotians. This is a Leader who, when he published his advertisement campaign, the first thing he did was apologize to Nova Scotians for not getting to know them over the course of the last number of years - that's his fault, no one else's. He apologized - I'm sorry you don't know me that well, I'm the Leader of the Third Party. That is an admission of guilt.</p>
<p>The other reason I don't think Nova Scotians are looking toward the Third Party or the Leader of the Third Party to lead this province is because, what is he going to do? There are two things that this Leader of the Third Party has been pushing - one, that he's an accountant. That's excellent, you know, we have a lot of great accountants. But you know, I'm scared to see what's going to happen to maneuvering of budgets if so-called "The Accountant" of the Third Party is going to get in; we'll see what kind of damage he can do there, what kind of games he can play. But also because the greatest idea that he has come up with, as Leader of the Third Party, is to stop our pursuit of renewable energy sources. Let's put a halt to that. We have high energy rates here, so let's not look at renewable energy sources. That's what the Leader of the Third Party is presenting Nova Scotians, Madam Speaker, and that's why people aren't looking toward him.</p>
<p>Well, let's look at what happened when the federal Conservatives started changing our Employment Insurance program to the damage of Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada; when the federal government's moving forward to changing fisheries legislation that's going to negatively impact independent fisheries in this part of the world. Where was the Leader of the Third Party when Nova Scotians needed him to stand up to the Prime Minister? In his seat, quiet. He was in his seat, quiet, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>Why, at a time, when the public was so against these federal changes, these federal Conservative changes, wasn't the Leader of the Third Party standing up for Nova Scotians, to the Prime Minister? Well, Madam Speaker, it's probably because he received $300,000 in appointments from Prime Minister Harper. Little Harper over here cares more about his relationship with the Prime Minister's Office than standing up for Nova Scotians when Nova Scotians need him most. And that is why Nova Scotians are not looking toward that Leader to represent their interests as we move forward in the next election.</p>
<p>So I want to assure the Leader of the Third Party, and the Third Party, while they train their guns on the Opposition and try to shoot for second place, we'll do what they should be doing, focusing our sights on the government and replacing them in government, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p>Now, back to the resolution at hand. I think that there are a lot of reasons why Nova Scotians should question the credibility of this government. This is a government led by a Premier who stands up in this House and says, we have kept every promise - virtually every promise. Let's look at those promises: not raise taxes - first year in, raised taxes. Promise broken. We will balance the books in the first year of our mandate - another promise broken. We will create 2,000 jobs a year, because we have a plan to keep jobs here; in the last year alone, this province lost 6,400 full-time jobs, and this government still has the nerve to stand up and say that we're creating jobs for Nova Scotians, important, meaningful, full-time jobs. It's not true.</p>
<p>Let's look at their approach to power. We are ensuring - according to the Premier, this is what the Premier says - that Nova Scotians have the fairest power rates that they can possibly have. What has happened over the course of the last three years? Power rates have increased by 30 per cent. And not only does the government ignore what's actually happened in the pocketbooks of Nova Scotians, they choose to misrepresent what the Opposition Party is saying when it comes to power. What this Party has said, Madam Speaker, when it comes to energy - and I'm saying this because I'm being asked by members opposite - that we will go at the heart of the problem when it comes to the energy market in this province, and that's tackling Nova Scotia Power itself. Breaking their monopoly, bringing competition into this energy marketplace. And what do they say? They say whatever Nova Scotia Power wants them to say.</p>
<p>That's why they're pushing forward blindly on this Muskrat Falls plan - they can't even answer the questions about how much it costs, how much it's going to save - but no, no, we have to go forward. We need to do this. Why? Because they don't know how to lead this province, Madam Speaker. And they're looking for Emera and Nova Scotia Power to lead them. That's what's wrong here.</p>
<p>Let's look at what this government has said around education. We're putting kids and learning first. Meanwhile, we're cutting $65 million out of the education system, putting additional stress and pressure onto teachers, putting them into the position where they don't have the resources to do their job to the level that we want them to, and saying we're putting kids and learning first. These are the things that this government said, and they continue to say to Nova Scotians, which makes Nova Scotians look at them and question their credibility in government.</p>
<p>Let's look at their management of finances, since this is now the final promise that they haven't kept, that they're going to try and keep, and probably run on: balancing the budget. All of the mistakes that we've made in the past three years, all those wrong decisions, all those cuts to education, we did that to balance the books. This will justify everything.</p>
<p>But what does that actually mean, Madam Speaker, when you look at it? What they're doing is presenting a budget that reflects prepayment - and I assume this is going to happen, because the Minister of Finance hasn't denied this. She had a chance to, and she didn't. We're going to present a budget that does not reflect payments to universities, because we're going to put that in the budget of this year. Prepayments to universities - that's something that the NDP railed against while they were in Opposition. Every year that the Tories did that, they railed against it. Now we see them employing the same accounting manoeuvre to balance these books.</p>
<p>Let's look at what happened in last year's budget. In last year's budget, the Finance Minister failed to disclose a $27 million overstatement in revenue estimates, something that the Auditor General noted and informed the public - $27 million overstated. Now, when that little secret came out in public, what did the then-Minister of Finance say? I don't really think people were paying much attention to that; I don't think people think it was a high enough number; it's so marginal, this $27 million.</p>
<p>What he failed to say was that it represents 10 per cent of the deficit - $27 million, that is not a small number. With $27 million you could mitigate at least half of the damage that this government has incurred on the education system, or you could get a ferry back in Yarmouth. You could do a whole bunch of things with $27 million. But this government, instead of just saying, oh, we made a mistake, sorry we were dishonest about it, let's move forward - they said, this doesn't make a difference, $27 million doesn't matter to our books, it doesn't matter to Nova Scotians. But the fact is that it does.</p>
<p>It does matter to Nova Scotians, and I think it's because of these things that this government has done that when they now get up and say, we're going to balance our books, Nova Scotians, just like the Opposition Parties, are going to question the validity of that statement. The political capital that this government had coming into office as a new government who governed for the first time ever in the province - and I will congratulate the New Democrats on that achievement. It is an incredible achievement.</p>
<p>This government had an opportunity to do things differently and represent the base that put them there, but they haven't done that. This has been a government that has rehashed the same Progressive Conservative accounting manoeuvres to make the books look better than they were, and it's the same Party that is going to use those accounting manoeuvres again to give them at least one victory that they can go back to the public with. This has been a government that has not come through on its promises to Nova Scotians, that has not kept its word to Nova Scotians, and that has misrepresented the facts and reality that exist out there in the economy, in the education system, and in the health care system.</p>
<p>That is doing the same thing that I'm sure every other Party has ever done, but the difference is that this Party said that they were going to do it differently. Sorry, Madam Speaker, but doing it the same as everybody else, and doing it worse, isn't doing it differently, and that's what this Party has done. They came in - we're different, we're different, we're the New Democrats, we are the Party of the people and righteousness, and every other Party that has ever governed this province has never cared about people like we do.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#71280477-3de0-4cef-90bd-e23864226ad3"><from>HON. PAT DUNN</from><p>Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I must begin by saying congratulations for being appointed Deputy Speaker, and I'd like to congratulate the member for Eastern Shore for being appointed Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>My congratulations to the Premier and all members of his caucus - the voters of this province have placed their faith in you and I respect their wishes. I would also congratulate all current members of the New Democratic Party for their own personal success, and of course congratulations to my own colleagues in the Official Opposition. I'm sure we will be a strong and fair Opposition voice, and together with our colleagues to my left we will make sure the government is addressing the issues that are important to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Listening to the members who have been on the floor speaking in the Throne Speech Address, I think about our beautiful province - we are blessed to be living in the Province of Nova Scotia wherever you go. The Bras d'Or Lakes, the Cabot Trail, on a lobster boat in the Georges Bay, Cape George, Antigonish County, the South Shore, the Annapolis Valley; we certainly are blessed to be living in probably the most beautiful place in the country, if not only the world. (Applause)</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, having the honour of being a member of this House of Assembly from 2006 to 2009, I really appreciate this opportunity to be here again representing the constituency of Pictou Centre. Many new members, I am sure, on election night were ecstatic and overwhelmed by what was happening, I felt the same, the fact being able to return to this historic location and represent the constituency back home in Pictou Centre.</p>
<p>I must offer a word of caution though as I remember back after the election and the dust settled in 2006, we were on that side, and over here on this side the Liberals were present and the Official Opposition were the New Democratic Party. In 2009, after the dust settled, there were some musical chairs and the New Democratic Party ended up over there as the government and the Liberals moved to the Official Opposition and we took our respective places over to the left. In 2013, things continued but, however, just to caution, Madam Speaker, we shouldn't be too comfortable in our chairs.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, all members of this House realize that family support is essential when one decides to run for public office. Unfortunately, five of my six children were not able to be home during the election, but they kept me busy answering their late-night phone calls, inquiring about the progress of the campaign. My youngest son was available on weekends. However, my wife, Patsy, a retired schoolteacher, did the work of the five who were not able to be home. If something had to be done - meals for the volunteers, errands to run, organizing canvassers, knocking on doors, computer work - she worked tirelessly doing whatever had to be done. She's a true inspiration for me, and I thank her for all her love and support.</p>
<p>It was Saturday afternoon and I was scheduled to hit the ice with two other coaches at four o'clock to have our first on-ice practice with the Pictou County Junior B Scotians. About an hour prior to practice, I received the anticipated call that the election was on. A message to the Speaker of the House, who is the owner/manager/team doctor and everything for the Eastern Shore Mariners: if they end up higher in the standings or if they beat the Scotians again this year, it's because I'm not behind the Scotians' bench. I want you to know that.</p>
<p>What a marvellous campaign team I had in Pictou Centre. I had approximately 200 volunteers. I'm so proud and honoured to have had so much support in this past election. I would like to take this opportunity to thank some of the members of my campaign team: Campaign Chair Brian Knight; Office Manager Harvey Ford; Official Agent Brian Buckles; Fundraising Chairs Ian Campbell and Darrell Rushton; Sign Chairs Alan Murray, Jim Aucoin, and Glenn Landry; Phone Chair Audrey MacGillivray; Office Coordinators Jean Murray, Rose Shaw, and Norma Decoste; Town of Trenton Chairs Wayne Otter, Barry Trenholm, and Fred Reid; Stellarton Chairs Amby Heighton, Jeannie MacDonald, and Ed Cormier; and New Glasgow Chairs Brenda Wilson and Patsy Dunn.</p>
<p>There are many other volunteers, and I'm going to mention just a few more: Bonnie Hafey, Kathy Decoste, Ryan Sharpe, Verna and Foster Elms, Jim Lynds, Walter Smith, Ron Marks, Brian and Darrell Marcott, Scott MacLean, Kathy Cambell, Jenny Harquail, Janet King, Harry Demone, Madelyn Evans, and of course, my sister Thelma.</p>
<p>Three special ladies honoured me by casting a vote in support of me during the past election: the first lady, Nan McKean from New Glasgow, at 102 years of age; a second beautiful lady, my Aunt Mary - Mary Dunn - cast a vote in my favour, and she is 101 years of age; and of course, Madam Speaker, I must mention also my own mother, who is presently 94 years of age. They were three of my biggest fans and followed the proceedings of the entire election.</p>
<p>I'm very pleased with our election platform, and I still think it was the best platform, with numerous suggestions and ideas outlining how this Party would improve the province and kick-start the economy under the leadership of the honourable member for Cumberland South.</p>
<p>I was thoroughly delighted on election night to watch the TV screen and see my Pictou County colleagues, the members for Pictou West and Pictou East, win their respective seats. They will be great representatives for their constituencies, and I look forward to working with them and sharing ideas. It is also pleasing to return and work with a few of my former colleagues: the member for Sydney-Mira-Louisbourg, the member for Argyle-Barrington, and the member for Hants West. I am looking forward to working with all members of our caucus.</p>
<p>I would like to tell the members in this Assembly a few words about my constituency, Pictou Centre. There are three towns in the core of Pictou County: Trenton, New Glasgow, and Stellarton. When you talk about the Town of Trenton you immediately think of the history of the steel industry in Pictou County. Trenton will always be known for the first pouring of steel in British North America, the very first steel-making industry in all of North America. In fact, Madam Speaker, in 1883 my great grandfather, James Dunn, was a member of the crew that poured the first steel in North America. James Dunn worked 64 years in that plant, retiring at the age of 83; I don't think the pensions were very good back then. He died in 1960 at the age of 96. Presently there is a monument in the town in front of the town office depicting the birthplace of steel in British North America.</p>
<p>His son, Harvey, also worked 55 years in the plant. My father, a machinist by trade, worked 46 years in the Trenton plant. He retired after 46 years without missing a single day and that's probably why I had to make it to school every day during my school years at home. If he was able to grab a lunchcan and go down over the hill to the steel plant, I had to go to school for a few hours.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I must say that I'm worried about the present state of affairs with the Trenton facility, the wind turbines, and DSME - Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering. The Government of Nova Scotia is presently a 49 per cent owner of the facility and in partnership with a South Korean industrial conglomerate. However, the approximately $60 million provided by the previous government has not lived up to any expectations. We presently have a small, skeleton crew at this large facility. Indications in 2010 from the partnership stated that there would be 500 employees working at this plant.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when the present company Daewoo received permission to strip the entire plant of its railcar equipment and machinery, the end of the railcar manufacturing at Trenton was over. I believe this was a mistake. If that equipment was still available in the plant today, we would have several hundred workers employed. The railcar industry saw 1,300 jobs at peak employment. In fact, after completing Grade 12, I had a working stint in the plant and there were approximately 2,300 employees at that time.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, the Town of Trenton has been facing significant economic turmoil during the past few years. Out-migration has affected all areas of Pictou County, including Trenton. Most services and businesses have moved on to other locations. Trenton residents must travel to New Glasgow, the commercial district for the community. With a declining tax base, the town has trouble financing existing services.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, one very bright area for the town is the ownership of one of the nicest parks in the province, 565 acres of centuries old coniferous trees, six kilometres of walking trail, six kilometres of bike trails, a 3,000 square foot family swimming pool and the opportunity to fish trout from a couple of ponds. Plans are underway to make some major renovations at the park and this will enhance the great location for family fun.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, when one mentions the Town of Stellarton, you automatically think of the rich history of coal mining and the home to Sobeys, the second-largest food retailer in Canada. Stellarton is home to the Nova Scotia Community College, the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry, several recreational facilities, walking trails, a track and field facility, an indoor soccer complex to name a few and it is also the home of former Premier Dr. John Hamm.</p>
<p>The Town of New Glasgow, Madam Speaker, was settled in 1784. The town is named after Glasgow, Scotland; Glasgow being a riverside town. The central location means a daily flow of traffic and activity that contributes to the economy of the area. As a commercial centre for Pictou County, the location helps business to obtain goods and services and for people to access services.</p>
<p>Pictou Centre is home to many wonderful yearly events - the Trenton FunFest, the Stellarton Homecoming Festival, New Glasgow Musical Jubilee, the Johnny Miles running event, Festival of the Tartans, Race on the River Dragon Boat Festival. New Glasgow is the home of a few former NHL players: Colin White, Jon Sim and Derrick Walser.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have several critic areas of responsibility. One of my favourites, of course, is Education. I have spent 30 years in the educational system, both as a teacher and as a high school administrator. We have great teachers in this particular province but perhaps the educational system is broken and hopefully with the work of all three Parties we can improve this system. (Applause) Our greatest resource is our children. Therefore education is an extremely important part of my responsibility. Changes must occur in the educational field and I am looking forward to working with the minister responsible for this portfolio.</p>
<p>The election is over and we must face the challenges that face all Nova Scotians - high taxes, high electricity rates, weak economy, lack of reasonable jobs, wait times experienced at our health facilities, out-migration of our youth, red tape that frustrates small business, the price of gas at the pumps. These are a few of the issues that voters continued to discuss during the election.</p>
<p>As the Official Opposition, we are ready. We are ready to hold the government accountable. We want to see Nova Scotia prosper. Government will be faced with many decisions in the months ahead and many will be difficult. Hopefully the government will rely on the Opposition Parties to share the responsibility for making these decisions. If this occurs, we will have the opportunity to succeed. The electorate have long lasting memories and they are expecting things to get better. It's time for the new government to act.</p>
<p>I wish to conclude my brief words by saying I am looking forward to working with every member in this Legislature in an effort to making Nova Scotia a better place to live and raise a family. It's obviously exciting to be in a position where you can make a difference. It is our duty in this House to make things better for Nova Scotians. We must put our Party's differences and philosophies aside and zero in on the real reason we are here - to assist and improve the quality of life for all Nova Scotians. Thank you.</p></speech>

<p>Madam Speaker, the document reads that just one day after being sworn in, the Premier signalled his plan to pull the plug on our public paving plant, but by doing so, "the Liberals have just eliminated competition between a small group of highly profitable contractors who've dominated the paving industry in our province and us, the taxpayers."</p>
<p>I'll read the final paragraph here: This move by the new government spells bad roads ahead for the majority of Nova Scotia motorists and happy days for the big contractors who had been making exorbitant profits until the in-house paving plan forced them to be more competitive. This was submitted by CUPE, a message from Nova Scotia's Highway Workers Union, CUPE Local 1867. Madam Speaker, I'll be tabling that pamphlet.</p>
<p>You can see, Madam Speaker, that with the assistance of my colleague, the member for Waverley-Fall River- Beaver Bank, we will be making sure that Nova Scotians will be bringing the issues regarding roads, roads, roads. Actually that was a quote from the member from the government side when she addressed the Speech from the Throne, I actually documented that. That was the quote from the member from the Liberal side, the member for Lunenburg, who used the issue regarding the number one issue in her election was roads, roads, roads. So I look forward to being a Critic for Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal and that's certainly important to me.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this caucus member certainly in this session will be asking the questions like I alluded to here and we'll be holding our government accountable and I certainly will be paying attention and making sure that we will be addressing the issues that are important to Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>Before I get into the fishery, I want to talk about who I am, and as a fisherman, I want to publicly say that I am surrounded by colleagues from all across Nova Scotia. I find it very important to express - to know where you come from and where you have been and where you are going. To me, as a young fisherman, I can tell you that I was out of the school system when I was 14 years of age, and I had my first commercial boat when I was 15. I was a fisherman for 38 years until I got interested in municipal politics. I spent nine years with the Municipality of Barrington and was elected three times as warden there. I went on in 2006, as I mentioned earlier, and became interested and involved and elected as a provincial MLA. (Interruptions) Actually, as you get older, to the member opposite, you get wiser. You make some decisions that actually benefit you going down the road.</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize the importance of speaking as a Fisheries Critic. I look forward to that. I look forward to the challenges and the issues that were brought forward to the previous government, and with my background I really felt that was something that was important to coastal communities right across Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Before I get into some of the topics here, I want to point out one of the reasons why I wanted to come to this House seven or eight years ago. I know that other politicians, some famous politicians, take a walk in a winter snowstorm to figure out where they want to go in their political career. I literally took the walk along Cape Sable Island beach to determine whether I wanted to come and do this job here. One of the little boxes that I could not tick off was that - this was something like nine years ago - if I did not pursue this opportunity, and if I was fortunate to live 20 or 30 years down the road and if I was in some retirement home or wherever, and I looked back on my life and said I wished I'd done that, I couldn't tick that box off - so I am going to go and try to get nominated and elected for our Party and be an MLA. That was the check-off mark.</p>
<p>The reason I did that was because at the time fishermen in our community could not get access to capital to purchase a fishing licence. I know that all of us around here come for different reasons, but I can tell you, that is one of the reasons why I wanted this job. Young fishermen could not enter the fishery. I know the member for Argyle-Barrington would say he was the one that changed that. I will say to him, yes, you changed it, but I campaigned on that and I made sure that was on the radar of the present government then - the PCs - and one person can make a difference in this House. We made a difference.</p>
<p>There were three points at the time, why I wanted to run. The second one was, there was a seniors home in Barrington that was reported and announced several times by all governments for the last 30 years, that this was going to be built. Madam Speaker, I did get called on a point of order in my very first speech for introducing a prop, and I want to just bring this to your attention. The prop that time was (Interruption) No, it was not a fish. It was the actual blueprint from Bay Side Home, which was 30 years old, and it was that thick. I got up and gave my Vanna White impression: here was a blueprint, 30 years old, of this home for seniors in our community that needs to be finished.</p>
<p>I can tell you today, that home is finished in the mandate that we were elected on. We did it. We got it finished. The blueprint was documented and tabled, and I got up, and a point of order was called, and then the Speaker gave up, he read me the riot act, read me the policies about how dare you, Mr. Belliveau, how dare you use a prop in this House.</p>
<p>I remember our Leader at the time, Mr. Dexter, sitting there and I said okay, Mr. Belliveau, you're in a little bit of a pickle here and how are you going to get out of that because your Leader is looking at you and you're going to have to address the Speaker. So I got up after the Speaker gave me his lecture about the Rules of the House and I apologized for not learning the Rules quickly enough, we were in there within 10 days, and I said I'll tell you what, I will learn the Rules in this House but you're not going to get me to stop talking about seniors or Bay Side Home until that is complete. That home, today, is one of the best across Nova Scotia and it's complete. So that is what one individual can do, and many individuals across that constituency wanted that home built.</p>
<p>The third thing that I ran on is transportation and that's why I'm very fortunate to be here today and have the critic area of transportation. There was a by-pass in Barrington which had been promised by four Premiers - I repeat, four Premiers - that previous to 2006 said the Barrington by-pass of Highway No. 103 will be completed. I remember Rick Grant coming up and doing an interview with me and I said that this had been promised for 30 years, blah, blah, and it's not.</p>
<p>Actually, one of my best friend's first jobs was doing the survey lines on that road. We had the crew come up and do a little story, and I can tell you that within six months that was on the tendering process of the present government and the road was complete. So you can get things done in this House, you just have to be consistent; you have to be focused on what you're trying to do and you can do it. People say, well you are actually not in government now, you are in a critic area, you're not going to get things done but I can assure that when it comes to roads, there's going to be work done and not only in the present government's constituency, but also in the other Opposition constituency.</p>
<p>I can assure you that the work will be completed there. If not, there's going to be a major issue and you will hear from it on the floor of this Assembly.</p>
<p>Before I get to the list I want to just say that one of the things I am deeply interested in - and the member opposite, the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, may want to pay attention to this - one of the things that I am deeply interested in is the underdeveloped species across our coast. I know the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism has spent time on the water, has spent time in the fishing industry. In the previous government, we went to Ottawa last February and made a presentation to the federal government and said that we were willing to make a financial contribution to collect science, to go out and make sure that we can develop new species, such as stone crab, whelks - I can give you a list of many different species that are not being utilized now and the fishermen know that these species are there. We need to diversify our economy, especially in rural Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>My question is that we made the commitment to develop at least two species in Nova Scotia and if you can just see how other Atlantic Provinces would make that same financial commitment, we could have growth in these communities regarding the fisheries. The first question is, are we going to pay for the science to do this? I'm hoping that the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism is certainly paying attention and that funding is going to be in place to do that.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I think it's time now. I'm sure that all of you have your pen and paper in hand, and I think everybody across Nova Scotia may know that there are a lot of similarities between a lobster and a politician. Again, I spent 38 years on the water fishing for lobster and other species. I spent seven years in this particular building and usually you have a lot of time or different times to make comparisons. People will say, how did you ever come up with 12 similarities between a lobster - give me a break here - and a politician? So pay attention. Let's see how close we are.</p>
<p>The similarities between a lobster and a politician:</p>
<blockquote>(12) Both need a hard shell to survive in their environment;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(11) People will try to bait you or are out to trap you;</blockquote>
<p>Question Period comes to mind.</p>
<blockquote>(10) Sometimes you need to throw some back - they're not a keeper and they need to mature;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(9) Be careful how you handle them - they could come back to bite you;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(8) No matter what region you are from, everybody thinks theirs are the best;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(7) Both a politician and lobster may or can hide out until the enemy passes;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(6) Both are always looking for a free meal;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(5) They both always look great at dinner;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(4) Politicians and lobsters are territorial and will defend an area possessively, or they'll certainly claim ownership;</blockquote>
<p>You may not like this, but it's actually true:</p>
<blockquote>(3) Both are cannibals, and at times will consume members of their own species;</blockquote>
<p>It gets better. This is the one I like:</p>
<blockquote>(2) Many people agree the best use is for fertilizer; and</blockquote>
<blockquote>(1) If they are not careful, both can find themselves in hot water.</blockquote>
<p>I think that's amusing. You have to have a little fun here.</p>
<p>I just want to end with a few comments on what we bring to the House. I was actually given a lecture by my former elementary school teacher, Sylvester Atkinson, on this point. Back in 2006, I got a congratulatory phone call from Sylvester Atkinson, who said he wanted to thank me for being elected here. I said, because of all my background, being involved with the fisheries and being on municipal council, I hope I bring common sense to the House of Assembly. He stopped me in mid-sentence and said, there's no such thing as common sense. It is rare sense. So regardless if you believe in rare sense or common sense, I really, truly believe that we all collectively bring the positive, our diverse backgrounds, to the House of Assembly and that's why we are going to make life better for all Nova Scotians.</p>
<p>I just want to wrap up some of my comments on this. We all bring different, diverse backgrounds. I look around me and we literally have a shepherd to my right, we have a preacher, we have a farmer, we have an actress, we have a coalminer's son, and a fisherman. You can't get a much more diverse background than what's around here today. I feel honoured (Interruptions) Well, the paramedics are in there too. I heard that we have a sprinkling of chartered accountants in here. (Interruptions) And teachers, yes, don't get carried away. I was just doing the background, literally the background here. I wasn't doing the whole 51. I know where I come from, and I know where I'm going.</p>
<p>I just want to end with this: on Remembrance Day in Liverpool, I had the honour of being a guest speaker, and I think this summarizes, before I close - I just want to add these few comments that I had for that particular audience at that time on Remembrance Day. Because I really believe, I think there was a member here who made reference to veterans in their Reply to the Speech from the Throne. So I think it's important that we bring this out.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, it is the veteran, not the preacher, who has given us the freedom of religion. It is the veteran, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of the press. It is the veteran, not the poet, who has given us the freedom of speech. It is the veteran, not the campus organizer, who has given us the freedom to assemble. It is the veteran, not the lawyer, who has given us the freedom of a fair trial. It is the veteran, not the politician, who has given us the right to vote. It is the veteran who salutes the flag and it is the veteran who serves under the flag.</p>
<p>So, Madam Speaker, in closing, it leaves me with one question: do we know who we are and do we know where we have come from? But the only question for this new government is, do they know where they're going? (Applause)</p></speech>

            <p>The honourable member for Cumberland North.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#34c1e608-d873-4164-95f2-86ccabbc60e9"><from>MR. TERRY FARRELL</from><p>Madam Speaker, thank you for the honour and the privilege of rising to give this address here today. I'm very grateful to be part of this very talented and diverse group that we have in the House. I'm also deeply humbled to be here as the representative of the people of Cumberland North. I would like to congratulate all the members on their electoral successes and to extend a sincere thank you to all the candidates who put their names forward. The electoral system in Nova Scotia is truly a fine example of how the democratic process should and does work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, while I was campaigning I met a number of people who didn't seem to appreciate this. I met many people who were disillusioned with our political institutions and who did not feel that they wanted to be part of this system. There are many among us who do not understand the value of their vote and the importance of participating in the democratic exercise. That was troubling to me and when I met someone with this point of view, I was sometimes at a loss as to how to address it, but I did have the opportunity to have my own faith in our system of government enhanced when I met Milu Rodrigues of Amherst.</p>
<p>I knocked on his door one evening during the campaign and Milu had the opportunity to tell me about his experience being a refugee from Idi Amin's Uganda in the 1970s. He hinted to me of the horrors that he had witnessed there and he thanked me for offering to serve in this role. He explained his appreciation for our system of democratic government and how he would always be grateful for the welcome and support that he received as a new Canadian from the Liberal Government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau. I wish that more people throughout the province had the chance to hear Milu's story so he could explain to them the importance of each and every vote and just how bad things can be under a non-democratic regime.</p>
<p>Today I have many people to thank, Madam Speaker. The success of our campaign in Cumberland North was earned through the hard work of many individuals. I'm going to mention a few in the hope that the many whom I'm not able to specifically name will understand. My campaign was ably managed by Russell Scott. Russell loaned us the experience of his own previous campaigns and the wisdom that he gained through his success in business. Russell and I began the campaign as mere acquaintances but by the end we felt like brothers to one another.</p>
<p>Young Thomas MacLaren, who was participating in his first campaign, handled his official agent duties with an extreme level of organization. I was always impressed by his maturity and his ability to remain calm under the many pressures of the campaign.</p>
<p>One of the senior members of our team, Charlie Bishop, proved to be a tireless road warrior, Madam Speaker. His dedication to the door-to-door campaign simply never wavered. I have to say, Charlie is a gentleman in his 70s who has undergone many campaigns and I was extremely proud of him and the encouragement he gave me throughout. Our campaign office was a hub of highly organized chaos thanks to the dedication of Diane Yarymowich and Gloria LeFurgey. Our campaign message was always expressed clearly and concisely with the guidance and support that we received from Geoff Degannes, Craig Farrell and Len Hendra. Rod Gilroy, a newcomer to the Liberal side of things, brought an extreme desire to win, a wealth of experience and a new outlook on how to run a Liberal campaign.</p>
<p>I have to give special recognition to someone I consider a special mentor and counsellor and throughout the campaign the person who was always there for me was Cathy Bragg-Gilmore. Cathy was the first to suggest that I could possibly attain this office and she worked tirelessly to make sure that happened. My never-ending gratitude is extended to Cathy and I'm extremely proud to be the first Liberal member to be elected in Cumberland North since her late husband, Ross Bragg, took the seat 20 years ago. I was hoping Ross's two children would be here to hear that, but I see they've departed.</p>
<p>Of course, I've left the last and most heartfelt thanks for my family, Madam Speaker. My sons, Joel and Andrew, provided their constant support for me from afar as they were both pursuing their lives elsewhere in Ottawa and in Moncton. My youngest son, Brendan, did have the pleasure of always being in the thick of the campaign. He was there and he never backed down from any chance he had to help whether it was knocking on doors, which was truly awful for him, or driving me around, which he didn't mind quite so much.</p>
<p>My wife, Nancy, of course, supported me. She was an astute advisor, a charming and outgoing companion at all the social functions that we had to attend, and she was also a very vocal cheering section; all this from someone who had no previous political experience and who, if you asked her, would call herself an introvert. I know that Nancy never dreamed that she could walk up and knock on a stranger's door, let alone that she would do up to 100 a day for day after day. My sincere thanks and love to my family for being there for me throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>This was my first campaign that I had been involved in in any capacity and I feel very fortunate to be blessed with this dedicated group of people who made it such a wonderful success.</p>
<p>I also want to take this opportunity to provide the members of this House with an introduction to the great riding of Cumberland North. Sometime over the four years prior to October 8<sup>th</sup>, I wondered if anybody in this Chamber actually knew where Cumberland North was, what the people there were up to or what their needs were. I have great hope that going forward from here that is going to change very dramatically.</p>
<p>Cumberland North touches on the mighty Bay of Fundy and it crosses the Isthmus of Chignecto, which is the land connection between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It's the sole area for entry by land to Nova Scotia and for a vast stretch of the riding it's bordered by the beautiful Northumberland Strait, which, by the way, has the warmest waters north of the Carolinas. (Interruption) We obviously have some Northumberland Strait cottage people. It goes along the Northumberland Strait on Route 6 until it meets the Colchester border in the Malagash area. It's an area rich in history, in resources and in people.</p>
<p>Right at the New Brunswick border, on the Bay of Fundy, you will find the site of the historic Village of Beaubassin. Beaubassin was the second French settlement in the New World after Port Royal. It was settled in 1672 by a surgeon by the name of Jacques Bourgeois, whose descendants still live in the area. One of Jacques Bourgeois' descendants is the Honourable Cindy Bourgeois, who sits on the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia here, in Halifax.</p>
<p>The Beaubassin site is now owned by the federal Crown and sits right on the edge of the Tantramar Marsh, which is the world's largest saltwater marsh. Much of that area is on land reclaimed and protected from the powerful ravages of the Bay of Fundy by a system of dykes. Beaubassin is a highlight of the beautiful Fort Lawrence area, which is as I've said the entry point to Nova Scotia. It's the first opportunity for visitors to learn about our beautiful province and a place that I intend to see become the point where visitors will learn of the marvellous experiences that they can enjoy in Cumberland County.</p>
<p>The Town of Amherst is my home, Madam Speaker. It's the place where my parents, Lewis Farrell and Alice Savoie, came to seek their fortunes during the Second World War. Amherst was a thriving industrial centre at that time. We were busy building airplanes and other machinery for the war effort. Back then, people didn't go to Alberta to seek a more prosperous way of life; they came to Amherst. Now currently, Amherst still has a core of manufacturing with firms such as LED Roadway Lighting, IMP Aerospace, and PolyCello. We are also a distribution centre for several large companies such as Staples, GFS food service, and Maritime Pride Eggs.</p>
<p>Amherst has a wonderful build heritage and visitors come in awe of our stately homes and the architecture of many of our public buildings. Amherst also has a rich political history being the home of four fathers of confederation: Sir Charles Tupper, Robert B. Dickey, Edward Barron Chandler, and Jonathan McCully were proud Nova Scotians with strong roots in Amherst. They participated in the Confederation conferences and were instrumental in bringing Nova Scotia into the Confederation of Canada. Sir Charles Tupper served as Premier of the Colony of Nova Scotia prior to Confederation and went on to become Prime Minister. Jonathan McCully was a Liberal lawyer, legislator, senator, and later a judge. I feel a special affinity for his story having a couple of these things in common with him and I've also had the opportunity to portray him on the stage in a dramatic presentation which was created by my good friend Dale Fawthrop.</p>
<p>Leaving Amherst and travelling east on the Sunrise Trail you'll pass through many small communities such as Hastings, Warren, Truemanville, Shinimicas, Linden, Tidnish, Northport, and Port Howe. All of these places have their own special charms, Madam Speaker. They are home to farmers and fishers and they are also some of the most wonderful and beautiful shorefront communities anywhere in the region - and by the region, I mean beyond Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The Village of Pugwash is home to the largest underground salt mine in Atlantic Canada. The mine is a major employer in the region. Pugwash is also the birthplace of 20<sup>th</sup> Century industrialist Cyrus Eaton. Along with Bertrand Russell, Eaton founded the original Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. This became an institution which organized subsequent peace conferences held at Eaton's Thinkers' Lodge in Pugwash and in other locations around the world. This resulted in this group being awarded both a Nobel Peace Prize and a Lenin Peace Prize. Both these medals are proudly displayed at the Thinker's Lodge in Pugwash.</p>
<p>Pugwash also displays all of their street signs in both English and Gaelic - and I plan to have the member for Timberlea-Prospect come and translate those for me sometime soon. Pugwash is also known for their wonderful summer festivals. They host, in the period around Canada Day, the International Gathering of the Clans, as well as later in July. Their community spirit is further displayed through their HarbourFest where thousands will flock to enjoy both entertainment and hospitality, and to, on occasion, view the Tall Ships as well.</p>
<p>Next along the shore, Madam Speaker, you would come to the Village of Wallace, which was originally known as Ramsheg, or "the place between". Wallace is famous for its sandstone quarry. The distinctive grey-coloured Wallace sandstone was used in the construction of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, the Province House in Charlottetown, PEI, as well as in this very building. The Wallace sandstone was used in the construction of this honourable Province House right here, where we sit today. This summer I had the opportunity to attend in the Community of Wallace when they were the proud recipients of the Lieutenant Governor's Community Spirit Award. This was a testament to their level of active participation in supporting their community.</p>
<p>Finally, along the north shore of Nova Scotia is the Community of Malagash. Malagash was the location of Canada's first rock salt mine, and there's a museum at the community centre there which recognizes this part of their proud history; Malagash is an active shellfish aquaculture centre, as well as a traditional farming and fishing community; and the temperate microclimate makes Malagash a prime grape-growing region, Madam Speaker, and, as we all know, where you have grapes you have wine. Jost Winery is the largest operating winery in the Atlantic Region. Jost is a major employer in the area and their fine product is known far and wide. I would invite you all to come up to the many great celebrations they have each summer.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, this is an extremely truncated tour of Cumberland North. I could go on and on about the riding and its many charms, and the things it has to offer but, alas, I've been told that I'm only allotted one hour for the task so I'll have to move on. I'll leave it at this, but I do encourage everyone to visit and to experience these many wonders first- hand.</p>
<p>In conclusion I want to talk about the time when I first had the opportunity to meet our honourable Premier. He came and visited me in Amherst in October 2012. We sat and we talked about what he had accomplished as the Leader of the Official Opposition at that time; we talked about my desire to become a candidate in the upcoming election. It didn't take me very long to decide that I wanted to be on his team; I wanted to be part of what he was creating. I felt an immediate connection to him as a person, and to the messages he was delivering. Based on this, I went to the people of Cumberland North and I made certain commitments, and as I sat in this House, Madam Speaker, and listened to the Speech from the Throne, I knew that I had made the right choice. (Applause)</p>
<p>To hear His Honour the Lieutenant Governor confirm the commitments of this government to families, small business, and local communities, assures me that I'll be able to go back to the people of Cumberland North and say that we delivered on our promises. Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#32a29c39-915c-40e7-b749-7c09299ed1f7"><from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from><p>Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand on my feet tonight in late debate on this most important issue.</p>
<p>I know that today during Question Period, questions were asked of the Liberal Government around their commitment to continue to support announcements, and more importantly, long-term care facility replacements and bed replacements that were announced by the previous government, and their commitment to do that.</p>
<p>If I heard correctly, the Premier and the Minister of Health and Wellness have committed to support those projects announced prior to the last election. I know that the residents throughout Nova Scotia who are looking forward to replacement beds or looking forward to a new facility to address their long-term care needs feel some relief.</p>
<p>Now, saying that, I hope the government lives up to that commitment, and it will be my job and our caucus' job to make sure that they do that. I was very glad to be part of a government that brought forward those lists. As the Minister of Health and Wellness indicated earlier today, there was a review of the needs of Nova Scotians across the province, and a list was compiled on some of the areas and some of the communities that really needed this issue to be addressed. I know the work that has gone into that was extremely important, and one of the things that came out of that report was the fact that these requests and these needs for long-term care beds - the new ones and the replacements - and the long-term care home care support placements were needed throughout ridings across the province.</p>
<p>Every member of this Legislature who was here prior to the last election knows how important these services are. There was no attempt at all to try to limit one riding or another just because of who their MLA is. One of the things we'll look forward to in the coming months and years is to make sure that those commitments made are kept. Hopefully it's some relief to some of those communities that have been waiting a long time. Long-term care and services for seniors have been a challenge for a number of years.</p>
<p>I know in my role in Opposition, when I first entered this Legislature, the Progressive Conservative Government tried to tackle the issue of long-term care, and what is the right number of long-term care beds that we need here in a province with a population of just under one million people? I've been a strong advocate that to address the issues of long-term care and support for seniors in our province doesn't only depend on constructing a new facility or adding new beds. It's a complicated issue, but it's an issue that you need to move forward on, on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>I criticized the Progressive Conservative Government when I was in Opposition. They seemed at that point only to be looking at building new facilities across the province. What lagged behind was increasing support for home care. What I heard as an MLA, what I heard as Minister of Health and Wellness, was that people wanted to stay in their homes longer. Improving services to allow that to happen needed to have some investment. That's why last year there was an increase in investment in home care support of over $22 million, so that we could start to do that. You could ensure that services were there and options were there for Nova Scotians. The most important thing is that Nova Scotians have options when it comes to them turning to government or turning to the health care system to get support for a loved one, be it a husband or wife, mother or father, aunt or a family member.</p>
<p>I think all of us should know personally, or someone who was a caregiver for someone who might have an ailment or who is a senior in the Province of Nova Scotia. It's not easy. It takes a lot of time and energy to support a loved one at home who might need home care, and many Nova Scotians take that task on themselves. Some of them continue to work in jobs full time, and then when they get off work they go home and support a family member. Most often it's a father, or a mother, or a spouse, or another family member. So the services they need when they do get to a point where they need support needs to be in place and they need to have those options. I'm hoping that the new government continues along the path of ensuring not only that there are replacement long-term care beds available across the province but there are new facilities that need to be constructed, but, more importantly, continued investment in home care and home services because you need to make sure that people have those options.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, most Nova Scotians, if not all, would rather stay in their home, especially towards the end of their life, Madam Speaker, in the comfort of where maybe they raised their family or where their loved ones are. That's why I hope, and I will keep this current government accountable to ensure that they keep that promise because there are communities across the province that are looking forward and have been waiting many, many years for the announcement that was made earlier this year, communities like New Glasgow, Wolfville, Mahone Bay, and also in Queens County.</p>
<p>Those are some of the areas that were announced for new or replacement construction in 2014. Also in that planning, in that review that was done, in 2015 there are a number of other communities represented from all Parties here in the Legislature, in Amherst, in Chester, in Clare, in Shelburne, in Sydney, in Antigonish. One of the areas where we have Sisters of St. Martha, who have been providing care for their colleagues for many years, and they came to government with a situation that they are at a point where many of the sisters are elderly. They're finding it very difficult to continue to provide that care and came to government and asked for government to support a new, 25-bed long-term care facility in Antigonish.</p>
<p>Madam Speaker, I hope that the government recognizes the importance of that project to move forward because the Sisters of St. Martha - I'm not from Antigonish but I know of the good work that they've done in not only providing long-term care for their colleagues but really building that community, building the facilities that are there, like the hospital for example so that their residents can gain access to appropriate health care.</p>
<p>Also The Birches, a home for special care in Musquodoboit Harbour, Madam Speaker, is another one of those projects. I was encouraged by the Minister of Health and Wellness who said all those 11 projects should be going ahead as they continue to be government and it will be my role to make sure that that happens.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#15a1cda3-8762-45c9-b3f6-609ff9fc7048"><from>HON. LEO GLAVINE</from><p>Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in my place tonight to speak to this very important topic, one that, in fact, particularly in the last few weeks, has been very much top of mind, as we say, or one of the hot-button issues that we are looking at in the province. One of the things, as we all know as MLAs, is that this will be one of those issues that each of us at one time or another will be asked to have a look at. Is there something that you could do to assist my mother, or my father, or actually in long-term care facility and continuing care, in particular, it can be of any age but this evening we are talking more about long-term care, the facilities available to Nova Scotians, also care in the home. These are the areas that we do need to address.</p>
<p>There is that startling basic demographic that we are all cognizant of in the House and the latest updated information, which now puts us at just about 18 years away, in 2031, when almost 30 per cent of Nova Scotians will be 65 and over. It's almost an unfathomable thought when we think about it - 25 per cent by around 2026, close to 30 per cent by 2031.</p>
<p>So the demands for continuing care through that latter part of the life cycle is going to challenge all governments, will challenge the federal government, provincial government, and at the local level to respond as strongly as we possibly can. In fact, since the year 2006, which really was the beginning of the Continuing Care Strategy, we've added about 900 beds to aging facilities and opened almost 1,000 new beds, yet the recent series of articles done by The ChronicleHerald indicate that we still have a list of 2,500 people who are hoping to get in a nursing home.</p>
<p>I know from my area - I'm not really speaking as much here from the Department of Health and Wellness statistical profile of who is on that wait-list - but I know to get in the facilities in the Annapolis Valley, to get into the Grandview Manor, Heart of the Valley in Middleton, people go through the assessment but they really work for that early assessment to get their name on the list because we do have a wait-list and that is the reality all over Nova Scotia. In all nine district health authorities there is a wait-list for people to get into nursing homes.</p>
<p>But there are actually different degrees, or a range of need to get into a nursing home and that's one of the issues that does face us. One of the areas why I think a real strong focus, and this is really where we're going in our first 100 days in office, is to take a look at what more supports can be given to elderly Nova Scotians to be able to stay in their home because as the former Minister of Health and Wellness just outlined as during his time in office, this is what he heard most often. It was one of the quotes that The ChronicleHerald used that I have said often and that I've heard many seniors say, help me stay in my home.</p>
<p>I think that is the operative word - provide a system of helps. Some are on the high end of medical interventions, and it's interesting that more and more medical procedures, medical helps, are in fact being brought to the home. Don't come to the clinic, don't come to the emergency room, we will come to you and I believe that's going to be one of the strongest system of helps that we can bring to this issue because we've already put a tremendous amount of money into continuing care. I think we're now up around - one of the facts that I was looking at today - we're into $538 million just on the continuing care for our seniors, which is a remarkable amount of money to be in that half billion dollar range.</p>
<p>So we know that we're really challenged in this province and this is one of the reasons that I'm very opposed to the new Health Accord, and I don't mind being on the record. When you don't look at a profile of your population, what are the needs of your population? We are clearly now number one in the country with the oldest average age population. That is one of the statistics that we've had confirmed through a number of different Statistics Canada studies.</p>
<p>This issue is not going away, and why we need to have a very, very significant review of the Continuing Care Strategy, but also to continue the dialogue. I think this was one of the reasons why we had this wonderful series that was just carried out by The ChronicleHerald, because we know that in some other jurisdictions in some other countries there are some innovative and other initiatives that are taking place that are helping seniors stay in their homes.</p>
<p>I know seniors who have no family members to come and support and work with them, even on some very, very basic tasks, whether it's looking after the lawn care, or in this season, looking after snow removal. I know in the riding that I represent we have a lot of big, old farm homes in the country, and it is still dependent on the wood furnace, and it's getting that help to get the five, six, seven cords of wood down in the basement. In fact, when we talk to stakeholders about what do we do to have a more robust home care program, it's interesting the number of times they move a bit away from their professional expertise and what they can offer to actually saying, you know, it is those small, daily tasks - if we had a stronger volunteer network.</p>
<p>I guess one of the areas that there are many community organizations, many church organizations that used to support our seniors. I absolutely believe that despite some of the very good things we need to do in the Department of Health and Wellness to support seniors, that whole consciousness around the whole community supporting seniors to stay in their home and to create a stronger climate of wellness and well-being as they advance in age. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</p></speech>

          <speech by="#72906878-3b4e-496f-adc4-15b4975f3aa7"><from>MR. CHUCK PORTER</from><p>Madam Speaker, it's an honour today to have a few minutes to speak in late debate on a topic that has been spoken about many times for many hours in this House, in this Chamber. I know that I have spoken many times on it over the years, and I know that the now-minister has spoken many times on it over the years.</p>
<p>I don't mind saying that this goes back a long way, a very long way, and some changes are definitely required. When I first came here in June 2006 I was standing in my place speaking about this when given the opportunity. I don't want to use the word "critical," but I did question our own ministers through our course of government, through the NDP's course of government, too, and now again I will have the opportunity to question yet another new Minister of Health and Wellness who I know understands this, as a long-time critic of this, and who comes from an area where it's consistent with the rest of the province where these issues exist.</p>
<p>This is going to go all the way back to this single-entry system, and I'm sure some of these ministers and former ministers and members of this House are getting tired of hearing me talk about this. I'm not saying that I have all the right answers, but I can tell you that nobody yet, as far as I know, has gone back to review this system of how people enter into the long-term care facilities. This has been an ongoing issue.</p>
<p>It changed quickly back a number of years ago, and it needs to be reviewed. It needs to be looked at, Madam Speaker. There is time now to do it. Something has to be done.</p>
<p>Now I will say also that not everybody wants to go to a nursing home, as they call it. I talk to many people, just like I'm sure all members in this House do and have over the years, who have been elected - we deal with it all the time. We deal with the wait-lists, and it has become - I hate to say it, but in the last four years - there was a time prior to the last four years that you could pick up the phone and you could contact the Department of Health and Wellness and say, where is Mr. So-and-so or Mrs. So-and-so on the list? Their family is inquiring, they have been through the assessments that are required, the financial pieces that are required. What happens? Well, we can't tell you that.</p>
<p>That only makes life worse for those family members who are desperately trying to look after their loved ones every day or have someone come in. People work, as we know. There are all kinds of factors. We need to be able to open that up so we are very transparent, that we are honest and forthcoming with people when they do call us to say, where is mom or dad on the list, or whomever? Why can't we just answer the question? What is the big secret around long-term care in the Province of Nova Scotia? I do not understand the answer to that. I have no idea why this is where it is - how we even got here for that matter. It's ridiculous. It should never have been that way.</p>
<p>It's bad enough the system the way that it's set up doesn't work, and I don't discredit the people working in the system. There are not enough of them, obviously. There are some issues there in the way that it's done, you know, we see people who may come from Cape Breton and end up at the Windsor Elms and vice versa, or wherever in the province - the so-called 100 kilometre rule in place.</p>
<p>There was a time not too many years ago, and I know this from experience - 17 years on the road as a paramedic - I know all about how patient transfer works and folks go into nursing homes, and we all do because our families have been there - a lot of our family members have been there and gone through this process. So we know, generally speaking, how this process works or should work. It should be fairly simple but it's not. So there's a lot of room to improve how that happens.</p>
<p>On the other side of that, we need to say to these people who say I want to stay at home, well, government is famous for it - not all governments - they are famous for developing programs that say: we're going to assist you to keep you in your own home and we're going to give you $400 a month, but before we do that, we're going to put you through this rigorous program. We're going to make you fill out this application and take this statement, and we're going to ask how much money you make.</p>
<p>Well, I want to ask you, Madam Speaker, what difference does it make how much money you make? Wealthy people get sick, poor people get sick, the people in the middle get sick, all have needs, and a lot of the needs are the same. Why does it matter what amount of money you make as to whether you qualify for some kind of health care assistance in this province? They are all taxpayers - a lot of these people their whole lives. They've worked hard and helped the government coffers to represent these programs and put money into it. So some people are $100 over, some people are $1,000 over, $3,000. Should it matter how much money we make as to whether we need assistance or we don't? There's a lot of room to improve this very system and, again, I know that I've been up many times talking about this and so far it has not changed a whole lot, if at all. It has probably gotten worse given the fact that things have tightened up by way of even being able to get information.</p>
<p>Part of our jobs out there - and we've heard different speakers today talk about do we know where we are or where we came from, et cetera; a very good point. Do we know who we represent? Do we know why we're here? Do we know what our jobs are? Yes, we do. Those people come to us who elected us and say: we need you to help us find out where mom or dad is on the list. That shouldn't be a great big task, but somehow that's a terrible thing. Heaven forbid we give out a little information. Everything is a secret in government. It's time to open that up.</p>
<p>I'm really, really hopeful, Madam Speaker, that some changes do come by way of departments, bureaucracy, all of that, so that these very simple questions, the answers can be given and should be given. This is not a big deal. They want to know if they're fifth on the list, or 10<sup>th</sup> on the list, or 100<sup>th</sup> on the list, so they can make plans going into the future months ahead, or years ahead in some cases, before they can get some kind of assistance. That is an important step for families and we need to realize that. The stress that is on family members - and I know again, having been there, not only working in the health care field but we all have our own families. We've all contributed in some way, probably in many ways and many of us in looking after our parents in some fashion. It's not an easy task and I can tell you having to deal with these people all the time, as well, you see the stress that it causes them.</p>
<p>Families have a very difficult time looking after families. There are some who are very good at it, who want to do it. There are some who just can't and, Madam Speaker, as we all know, that is understandable. We can appreciate that. That's why there's a system in place to help look after people who are sick in this province, and thank God we have it, and in this country. So as we go forward, I hope we take the time and not rush it, take the time that we need. We know, I guess the paper says and we've heard for some time there are about 2,500 on a wait-list. We know we're not going to go out and build 2,500 new beds.</p>
<p>Now, I get a bit of a kick out of the NDP who put forward this motion about all the beds that they've created. Well, I've got to tell you the only beds that ever got rebuilt were beds that were announced prior to the 2009 election, Madam Speaker, that the Tory Government announced. Now, let's make that clear for the record. That was announced by our people in those days and that's fine. They got done and they got completed. Then there was an announcement for another bunch of new beds - when was that? It was just a couple of months prior to an election. Everybody saw that for what it was, I think, and that was clear on October 8<sup>th</sup>. You can't wait four years and say we're going to do what we're going to do and then not do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Madam Speaker, that's neither here nor there because that day is past - it's a new day and there is a new government. Elections tend to create hope in people, no matter where they are around the world, and this province is no different. When you talk to people on the street, they say great, we have a new government, we'll live with that. The people of Nova Scotia have spoken, but we have expectations at the same time. That's the right thing to do. They'll be watching, those people who have been waiting in places like Unit 500 in the Hants Community Hospital will be anxiously waiting to see if there are changes toward the long-term health care system and how those placements are done.</p>
<p>The phones will still ring, the appointments will still be made, the people will still come in and they'll be asking about their mom or their dad and whoever it might be - their brother or their sister waiting placement - they'll still want to know those answers. I know it will take time to make those changes and I think we need to be right up front and honest - we understand it will take time and a giant department like the Department of Health and Wellness that has a huge budget that manages nearly half the provincial budget alone in health care. Things have to change. I think the minister knows that. He has been in this House a long time; he's gone through many budgets; he has asked many questions in the estimates. If anybody knows, I'm sure that he knows.</p>
<p>I don't mind saying this, as I've said to others, I know that I am here to support good programs that will come forward, to support ideas that will make life better when people are sick, to get placed in a time frame that is acceptable, and to also create programs to look after people at home. The minister mentioned things like snowplowing and cutting grass, and coming from the country where I come from there are still large homes, and we don't want everybody to just abandon their homes and move into a nursing home. Not everybody wants to do that, and I hope we have a focus on supporting those folks who want to stay home until the end.</p>
<p>And some of them do want to stay home and they want to die in their homes - and that is fair, there's nothing wrong with that. A lot of people you talk to, even those in nursing homes will tell you they would rather stay at home, they would rather die at home. That's their dignity; they deserve that. It is our job as policy-makers in this province to do it and to make it easier for that to happen if at all possible and to support them through those programs.</p>
<p>I don't care what their incomes are, I don't care if it is $400 or $600, or whatever the assistance is required, you need people, and there are nurses looking for jobs - they were called CNAs, I don't know what you call them today - LPNs and so on who are looking for jobs. There are home care abilities, I hope we take the time to look at every aspect of the long-term care operation in this province.</p>
